The members of Wales' representative's office are afraid to look like fools.
Some Members of the House have confused the proposal that their title should be replaced by a MWP, a member of the Wales Parliament (Man of the Welsh Parliament).
The coup started with the plan to turn the name of the representative body into the Wales Parliament.
Members of the delegation are concerned, irrespective of the party's position, that change can make them look at.
According to a representative of the Labour Party, the group is concerned that the name 'seriously with Twp and Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupidity and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the conservative party, his group is in favour of a 'open mind' change of name, but points out that the MWP word has a short, literal spell for a stupid word.
In this context, Wales' language w-books are written in a similar way to that of Yorkshire's U-book in England.
The Commission, which is currently preparing the legislative change required for the change of name, said as follows: "The final decision on the nomenclature representing members of the representative body is of course a member of the members."
The Law on Wales’ Administration of 2017 empowers representatives to change their names.
In June, the Commission published an opinion on the proposals, according to which the appointment of representatives of the Wales Parliament will enjoy broad support.
The Commission favours the members of the WMP as members of the Wales Parliament, but the MWP option was most supported in the public opinion poll.
The members of the delegation are apparently proposing alternative denominations, but the lack of consensus can give rise to a fundamental effect on President Elin Jones, who is expected to change the bill within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other changes to the activities of the representatives, such as rules on the loss of representation and the form of a committee system.
In the course of the legislative procedure, Members of the Representatives' Office may give their final vote on the title to which they should be invited.
The Macedonians are going to the election hall in the referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a dispute with Greece that has lasted decades, which has also been called Macedonia's own province.
Athens has long repeated the fact that the name of the northern neighbours is practically a requirement for a regional area and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
The Macedonian President against the referendum, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he will not vote.
However, those who support referendums such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev explain that the change in name is simply a price for membership of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martins are slowing down when the churches of Harlem live in difficult times.
"The elderly people I've been talking to say that before each street corner there was a bar or a church," says Adams.
"There ain't neither of us yet."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "A man's relationship has changed."
Bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighbourhood where people gather regularly.
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property is not as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later, they have returned to the circle of departure."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not supported by the remaining shrines of the neighbourhood.
"The majority of people who buy housing from these buildings will be white people," he says, "and thus they will be in the middle of the day when these churches will close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of these people moving to these rooms would become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black - metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins in a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired a building for its possession.
St Martins took over the black congregation under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the dealers of 125th Street, the central trade street in Harlem.
When Father Johnson’s congregationists planned to rebuild, they introduced a towering game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tornado game "the clock".
In July, an expert who played a tournament game called it "the cultural treasure" and "the irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also pointed out that it was the world's first towering game played by a black musician.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex gap involving architects and contractors hired by the church governors and, on the other hand, by the Episcopal giants.
In July, the governing body, consisting of secular leaders in the congregation, wrote to the archbishop, in order to “supervise the costs,” he added, “but he did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the hippo.
Some congregation members complained about lack of transparency in the case of the archbishop.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old drunkster in California.
The authorities tell us that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him when he dived into the lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encineitas just before seven in the morning.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he and his friends had dived on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and the group went to the boy to help with this water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was only excited to catch a lobster, but then he realized this screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
When he got to him, Hammel says he discovered that this entire solo bone had been torn open.
"I told everyone to leave the water, "There's a shark in the water!" "Hammel added it.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of sharks attacked are unknown.
In the media, Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been found in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious injuries from his upper arms story.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casabladin Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for scientific and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK Kingdom Beauty Department
Sainsbury's challenge is to challenge Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in the department of beauty care, where they serve expert advisors.
This is an important movement for the UK's 2.8 billion - worth of beauty treatment, which continues to grow even though the sales of fashion and household equipment are undermining. Largest beauty care departments are being tried in 11 stores across the country and, in success, they are extended to other shops next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's tells of its beauty treatment range of doubled 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive additional space and will receive their own brand-specific region like Boots stores.
Supermarketti also reschedules its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers increasingly demand it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop has tried rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first one was opened last week in Croydon South London, and the second one is opened at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food to nearby shops for small single purchases will force supermarkets to invent new incentives for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops will look even more like stores when the supermarket chain struggles against cheap shops like Ald and Lidl, adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habitat shops. The company tells that it has promoted the sale of food and made it profitable for purchases.
Supermarketti failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty care and pharmaceutical departments.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boosts at the beginning of the 21st century, but the cooperation ended with the question of how the returns of the pharmaceuticals on supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows a business transaction in which Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, by 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company reported Lloyds as part of a plan to extend four stores to a range of general skin care products with signs such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The commercial leader of Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hicks, said as follows: "We have changed the appearance and mood of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in workers who have received special training who are ready to advise clients.
Our brand range corresponds to all our needs and attractive environments and our convenient location makes us a convincing place to buy beauty care, challenging the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones in his "crazy" Holly Willoughby's withdrawal after 11 million pounds of contract
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his "happy" when the TV driver Holly Willoughby withdrew from the agreement of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and accessories.
The two companies are compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old developer of this Morning program announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby managed the Dragons Den star Peter Jones to withdraw from their productive lifestyle business in the last few moments, and now he's going to focus on his new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell me that Jones was in his "happy" last Tuesday at a lively meeting that was held at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire.
The company was compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and was attracted to a double Willoughby’s estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
According to a 37-year-old Willoughby, he left Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was obviously Holly's most important project.
It was his long - suffering plan, which was to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left everything to be astounded.
No one had faith in Tuesday's events so close to the publication.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting for sale.
This Morning driver is one of the UK's most reliable stars, and according to experts, he can cause millions of losses to the company due to product sales, including all the pillow candles and clothing for household supplies, not to mention delays in publication.
It may mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his spouse Dan Baldwin have been close for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby arranged for Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over in March.
Couples holiday together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby's resting on the new brander of M&S and replacing Ant McPartlin's ITV I'm A Celebrity program.
The source close to Jones said last night that we would not comment on his business.
A lot of talk, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism that he would receive in the media his comments, which some would consider inappropriate to the President, as well as his positiveness to the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much to you?
Trump said he was pretending to be a "new anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested to meet again after Trump had set the first meeting in July as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear pollution.
However, the nuclear negotiations have failed.
After more than three months of the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see an "comparative reaction" from the United States to the early armed forces of North Korea.
Instead, he stated that the United States would continue to make sanctions for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results. The missile tests have been completed, hostages have been helped to freedom and the remains of the American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relations with Kim.
"It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more out of this precision, we would have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly to the audience ahead.
The tsunami and earthquake of Indonesia destroyed the island hundreds of dead people.
For example, the post-Lombok earthquake studies told several foreign volunteer organisations that they were not needed.
The state of national emergency for international assistance was not declared, although some 10% of Lombok’s inhabitants had remained homeless.
"In some cases, they have unfortunately made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging", said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a group traveling to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
The informant of the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation Please see whether international organisations would be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia is still unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account repeated earthquakes.
Although Acehi has been built on tsunami shields, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The prayer was likely due to lack of human life, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital boat assigned to assist the victims of the Lomboki earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days before it reaches a new disaster area.
President Joko Widododo made an ongoing infrastructure development of Indonesia at the centre of his election campaign, and he has provided money to improve roads and railways.
However, there has been a financial shortage of governance, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Some pressure also increases the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the earth has adopted an older form of religion.
Christians and Muslims have fought street battles with jungle knifes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, leading to the death of more than 1,000 people, and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.

Daniel Sturridge saved from Liverpool's loss on Saturday in an election night, painting for 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received feed from Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's goal when his team was in the position of defeat.
He moved the ball to the left before he was terrified of the shot at the back end.
The shot was cut over the high penalty area towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
"I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one contact, and I shot him without thinking too much."

Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after being found dead with a stabbed woman.
A woman's body found at Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police are asking people in the area to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its originals, but I appeal to all those who were in Birkenhead, near John Street, to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to everyone, especially the taxis, who may have recorded something on the machine video, to contact the police, and may have vital information for the investigation."
A female informant from the police has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, a woman may have come to the crime scene who's been asking about her crime scene.
As the investigation continues, the police say they're trying to inform the victim of the close-up.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back into his apartment, but the police had told me that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that you can go for hours before they are allowed back in.
A constable was heard telling the man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman on the scene.

Parliament's Cromwell passport was part of the history rewrite package
The desolation of the statue would be a poetic right, considering that his own fanaticic puritans destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best tabiblians.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "typerydex" and "for the rewrite of history".
The President of the Cromell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a target of Oliver Cromwell's statue on behalf of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't order or execute the English civil war iconoclam.
True Cromwell might have to suffer the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s wonderful description of Cromwell’s opinions is reflected in the 19th century’s opinions and is historical evidence of a character that many still consider to be worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Monet, although perhaps more than in the 1800s than it is today, consider Cromwell as the defender of this Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was caused by monarchy in this case.
Is this an exact description of the subject, then, of the ongoing historical debate?
It is certain, at least, that the dispute between the mid 16th century has shaped the future development of our nation, and that Cromwell must be identified as a character representing the other half of that division.
In addition, as a state nurse of his achievements, he deserves to be grateful and remembered."
Killer's cocked a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media report that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him on the market in South-East China.
Only by his last name was the body of a man identified as "Yuan" found near Liupanshuin on the market in Guizhou. The man's artery had been broken and he was on top of the blood, South China Morning Post newsed Sunday.
The Sicoma Shepherd is prepared to vaccinated pigs in the swine on 30 May 2005 in Xinghai Province in China.
He and his cousin were newsed traveling from the nearby Yunna Province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also saw the door of the nearby pig.
In Sikala, he said he saw a big scream with his mouth in his blood.
According to the news, the forensic investigation confirmed the death of a 250-pound-mile-moving farmer.
Your Guiyang Eventing News tells me that cousin Wu said "my cousin's feet were bloody and carouseled."
The surveillance camera shows the cousin arriving on the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed the pig didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the Torin leaders told the Eventing News that the pig had been locked down so that it would not harm others when the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and thetor authorities are told to negotiate the death penalty.
Pigs are known to have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, nearly 300-pound pigs climbed against this tractor of the Wales farmer until his wife managed to intrude in the path of the animal.
After the event in 2012, the Oregonn farmer told the CBC News that although pigs are generally not aggressive, blood taste can function as "saints".
"They're just playing games.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt you.
All you have to do is respect them properly," he said.
The remains of the Hurricane Rosa bring large amounts of heavy pollution to the lunch halls of the United States
My Hurricane Rosa is predicted to decline as she moved to the coolest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
In the near future, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and to the lunch halls of the United States.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, i.e. Hurricane number one, on Sunday morning five o'clock in the east coast, and it was 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
There is also a low pressure on the Pacific Sea, heading eastward towards the west coast of the United States, which, on the arrival of Rosa in the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, is starting to push deep tropical humidity northward towards the US southwest.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity, which will then be intertwined with the approaching low pressure, will form large rainfalls for lunch in the near future.
On a local scale, rainfalls of 25-100 millimetres cause dangerous heavy rainfalls and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfalls of 50 to 75 millimetres per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas in lunch, and especially for Arizona, it is expected that rain will be between 50 and 100 millimeters.
High rainfalls are possible, and conditions can be rapidly reduced due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
When tropical rain is threatened, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness.
The heavy rains can turn canyons into leaking rivers and thunderstorms cause local windwood and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy pollution to southern California coastal vessels.
It is possible to produce more than 10 millimetres of rain, causing small waste streams and soluble roads.
This would be the first rains of the rain season in the region.
The fragmented tropical rainballs begin to approach Arizona late on Sundays and early Mondays until the rains expand on Mondays and Tuesdays.
The rainfalls spread to Four Corners on Tuesdays and last throughout the Wednesdays.
In October, the United States can see a lot of intense defrosting at temperatures in the Arctic, but while the trophies remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large temperatures defrosting at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, an excellent example of great temperature differences is seen on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines.
The slowing heat of the summer is once again trying to increase and expand in the coming days.
The beginning of October is expected to be widely warm in central and eastern parts of the United States, while the temperature is at +26 degrees south of the plains of the North.
In New York, the temperature can hurt on Tuesday +26, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, the eastern United States has high potential for higher temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million considered the consultation of Brett Kavanaugh
On Tuesday, more than 20 million television broadcasts by six television channels, in which the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasay Ford, accused of sexual crime in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political patat situation continued to stop the transmission of television companies, at the last minute, on the basis of the agreement organised by Senator Jeff Flake, the FBI conducting a week's investigation into the accusations of the accusations of Senator Arizona.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100 % sure that the mad Kavanaugh was suffocating him and tried to take his clothes off at high school.
Kavanaugh, for his part, gave an emotional witness that said he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
The audiences were probably more than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring viewers who look at offices.
Something about proportions tells us that the reading corresponds to the viewer of the American football play or Oscar gala.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of television companies were Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the entire day’s consultation.
ABC was second with 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, 2.94 million NBC, 89 million MSNBC and 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
In the middle of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS' cameras described how the protestors' screams led him to the elevator on Friday on the way to the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
CNN looked straight, how he was standing on a minute's trade with a look down when the thunders flew.
"Sison right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he will tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Mr Flake said that he had given his opinion and added that he would have more to tell us before closing the elevators after the committee was consulted.
Hours later, cable and public transmission networks were sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs started voting for the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said that he would only act in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was convinced in part of his friend, the democraticist Chris Coons, based on the discussions he had with him.
Mr Flake made his decision after having discussed with Mr Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice was power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexiti's politics
In his interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people of criticising his EU-difference plans for politics that threatens the future of Britain and its national interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the conservative party meeting in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
Another interview was published on the front page of May's interview, where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for Britain and the EU to apply import duties to each other, "I'm not making sense".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a person suspected of a basketball game in the LSU playing 20-year-old Wayde Sims' death shooting.
Twenty-year-old Dyton Simpson has been arrested and transferred to prison, and Baton Rouge's police department says he's being accused of murder at second grade.
The authorities published a video of the investigation between Sims and Simpson, where the police report Sims lost his glasses.
The police found the glasses from the scene and told me they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police say Simpson admitted that Wayy was being shot in interrogations.
According to Advocate, his guarantee was set at USD 350 000.
On Friday, the medical examiner of East Baton Rouge's municipality published a preliminary report saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The Agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Team, the state police's criminal laboratory, the Southern University Police and the region's residents to assist in the investigation.
Joe Alleva, President of the LSU, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "newness and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball in the LSU.
He wrote an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 albums in the match last season.
LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said he was "lost" on Friday morning, and "deathed" about Way's death.
"You always fear something like this happens," Wayde said.
The volcano spits on the ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the Mexican disaster prevention centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcanoes when the crater was accelerated and there were 183 gas and ash explosions recorded during the day.
The Centre will register and shake several times.
In social media pictures were published in which car windscreens covered a thin ash layer in areas such as Xochimillo, Mexico City.
Geographicists have detected an increase in the activity of a volcano in the southwest of the capital from 72 kilometres after the earthquake of 7.1 Magnitude in Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and catalanic parasites join together before the anniversary of the vote on independence.
On Saturday, six people were arrested at the meeting of the protestors and the mellakple police who supported independence. Thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote.
The police arrested a group of masked independenceists who threw a police officer in eggs and powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled by tourists.
During the day, more sharks broke out when the police used their sweaters to control the nostrils.
Consistency between the independent supporters and the groups of the Unionists continued for several hours, while the previous ones were called "no forgetful, no forgiveness", and the latter "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people were treated for minor injuries in demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface in the area of independence one year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which the Catalan parameters celebrate.
The voters elected independence by a clear majority, although there was a low difference in the vote in the opposition boycotties.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent gatherings when the police tried to prevent voting on voting in polling stations across the region.
The groups in favour of independence stayed outside on Friday in order to prevent the demonstration that supported the national police.
However, the demonstration was arranged, but it had to go on another route.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician, who participated in separatist demonstration with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about the independence of Catalonia.
"In the last year, we experienced one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents cry out of joy when they could vote, but now we're stuck in place," he says.
Despite the vital gain of last December's regional elections, the speed of the parties that are in favour of the independence of Catalonia has fallen this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are in a voluntary exile or arrested waiting for the trial of their involvement in the organisation of a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described the police as a profitable demonstration on his phone, says on both sides of the politicians, he's arguing about the lieson.
"You'll be blackmailed all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Censors of Censorship since the last nine years, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Encouraging a European candidate is the best way to condemn the upheaval of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.

Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
They might have shot at the car some time later in the attic.
Livingston won the Rangers 1-0 Menga goal
Dolly Mengan's first goal in Livingston confirmed victory
The serial number of the Livingston astonished the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerard the second defeat in 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox Society.
Dolly Mengan's goal was finally won by Gary Holt's team to the second place divided by Himernian.
Gerardi's crew missed the first guest victory of the season in Premiership. Next Sunday, it will meet serial leader Hearts, which is eight points ahead.
In the meantime, the Rangers will meet again at the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued in the series to measure six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet disappeared since he was replaced by Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places against a visitor suffering from steel deficiency
The Holt team should have been led long before the goal was given the Rangers' terrible trouble with his youth.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finalization went wide, and the next thing I did, Alan Lithgow was able to slide into Craig Halkett's bag, but he was driving the ball by.
The fathers were willing to hand over the ball to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccination against special situations.
That's exactly how an important goal came in.
Rangers caused Livingston a free kick from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga a place from which he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finalize.
The Rangers had been holding the ball by then, but he said that the home team was holding the defense, and the goal guard Liam Kelly didn't get a lot to try.
The same pattern continued during the second half of the time, even though Alfredo Moreelos forced Kelly to fight.
The Rangers' goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, prevented Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow, led the ball by another special situation in Livingston.
In addition, two situations were called in vain for a penalty kick - the cut-off exchanger Glenn Middleton and the hand-to-hand ball.
"A great performance from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotlann with Alaskan Lamont Tony Macaroni
It's a great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to go beyond expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the rising lead.
However, the team's way of playing and the crew have not changed their way back to the highest set level.The hotel must be given recognition of the way in which it has strengthened the team once it has arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great leader of a well-organized defense, while Menga was holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to his toes the whole fight.
There were no ideas from the Rangers, though.
The team has been very good at Gerardi from time to time, but it has now remained far from his requirement level.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open up a home team defense just once. This should be a wake-up for Rangers, which is the middle class of the comic book.
Erdogan received a different reception in Cologne.
The smile was sensitive and the sky was blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the visit by President Erdogan to Germany, who is in dispute, with the aim of correcting relations between NATO allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and Turkey's efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
In the city, the largest Turkish population is located outside Turkey.
The police prevented the 25 000 supporters from gathering before the Musketeer, setting it up for safety reasons, but there were still many supporters to look at the President.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurdejas, also brought their voices to those of the people, condemning both Erdogan's politics and the German government's decision to invite him to the ground.
A number of the German Turks greet him as a hero in the face of others to be self-responsible.

Long Lart prison: Six guards were injured in trouble.
Prison officials report the high security classification of six prisoners in prisons.
In the HMP Long Lart prison in Worcastershire, there started and continued at around 9:30 a.m. on Sundays in Britain.
There's been an emergency police officer in tornado to calm down the unrests behind which eight prisoners are in one prison wing.
The police's minor facial injuries were handled at the scene.
A prisoner medical officer said: "HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent to special training prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken from the police's care and may have to spend longer behind the calendars."
The HMP Long Lart prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reported to have received hospital treatment in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October, policemen of riots were alerted for serious restlessnesss in which they were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
Arizona rarely receives tropical low pressure, but that's exactly what happens at the beginning of next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa pass over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rainfalls.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on rough rainy Mondays and Tuesdays from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, South-Kaifornia and Utah, as well as on Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will arrive on Monday in the form of rain.
Phoenix's national weather service pointed out in its twitter. Only "10 tropical storms have kept the state of tropical storm or low pressure at 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane at a distance of 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict the rains of 50-100 millimeters.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central rock mountains and Great Basin, it is likely that between 25 and 50 millilitres will be available. In some places it may rain up to 100 millimetres.
The rains of the rose can also be a blessing by testing droughts in the area if there is no risk of heavy pollution.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful because of the difficult drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drying Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest grade, says Weather.com.
My Hurricane Rosa makes her way first to a landing in the California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Sunday morning Rosa has a location of 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugene, Mexico. At that time it is still a hurricane with a strong wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm will lose its power when faced with colder waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to enter Mexico as a strong tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In part of Mexico, rains can be harsh and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"A north-west-Sonora in California is expected to be 75-150 millimeters, and up to 250 millimeters is possible", says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesdays during the morning, where it will continue its journey through Arizona to the south of Utah on Tuesday.
"The greatest risks to the root or its remains are linked to very harsh rains in the California Peninsula, North-Sonora and the American Southwest desert," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfall and waste streams in deserts, as well as earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder

The police are asking for contact with anyone who may have video footage stored on a mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party's "immortality and anger"
"The voice, on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh, is a voice against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the democratic party," Trump said at the meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered the 'sickness and anger' of the democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the charge of sexual harassment by Christine Blasay Ford, which would have happened decades ago during their teen years.

"The voice in favour of strengthening the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for one of the most respected judicial students of our time, with excellent mermaids for public service," he told his support team in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voting activity in the field.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just campaigning, but campaigning full," he said.
"That's why I'm going all over the place to fight for the excellent candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats took the task of "responsibility and prevention".
The senior assistant from the Republican leadership told CNN that the first important vote on the Kavanaugh appointment procedure is expected to take place at the Senate by Friday.

It says that the landscape of a long and narrow city near the bay could bloat the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "a broad" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had fallen.
He reported the ruins of some of the bodies found in the victims, adding that 540 persons had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and that the damage may be larger than the Palace 300 kilometers north on a continuous coast called Donggala in a region closer to the center of the earthquake.

According to the opinion of the Red Cross, over 300 000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not telling us that the tsunami hit Palu. However, the authorities said that the waves had arrived during the warning.
In the social media, a man on top of the building, crying out a lot of warnings to people on the street.
Only minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, taking buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify even the authenticity of the image.

The city airport has only been reopened for relief measures and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was supposed to visit, please at the evacuation centers on Sunday.

"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
At the initiative of the aid groups, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and staff from abroad can start to flow only after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"But there is a country level disaster in the city," says Aulia Arrani, a journalist of the Indonesian red cross.
"As the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can begin to receive international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made".
When the second night landed at the top of the Friday earthquake and after the tsunami, friends and family members who were lost lived up to hope that their close proximity to the miracle trade would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted from the drain.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subando, coach of the Indonesian intercom, had trained two addicts on the roof for the Asian race that ended earlier this month.

Kanye West: The keyboard changes its name Ye
He's going to change his name. He's going to change his name.
When he announced a change on Twitter on Saturday he wrote: "The character that was used to be known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change is before his future performance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Aria Grande, who, according to the author of the program, cancelled his participation for "sensical reasons".
West has previously told him that the word also has religious significance in addition to being shortened by his trade name.
In discussing the name of the album earlier this year with the radio driver Big Boy, West said, "you believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there it is "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began from Kane, which means only one thing, and ended up in the shortest form, Ye - which only manifests the goodness, evil, confusion, nothing more.
Albumi is primarily a question of who we are."
He's one of several known rappers who've changed their names.
Sean Combs is known differently as P. Diddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he would recommend names for Love and Brother Love.
The former West partner, JAY-Z, has also removed and returned the link and the large letters.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians.
The Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Saturday at Tlatolco Plaza, promised that "no one would use the army to tear the people of Mexico".
The armed forces set fire to the peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during the time when left-wing student movements were on their way to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised support for young Mexicans by providing monthly study support and by opening up more free public universities.
He said that there was a lack of unemployment and training opportunities for young criminals.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
The United States should double the funding it uses to investigate artificial intelligence when China improves its activities, says the funding and artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by notifications concerning the artificial intelligence of various parts of the US administration, although the United States lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to lead to the development of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A doubled research budget would be a good start when we note that other countries are so much behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee says.
The double funding could double the probability that the next major artificial intelligence project would be made in the United States, Lee reported this week's CNBC interview.
Leen's book "Emergency Powers: China, the Silk Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Convention Office, which is acting as CEO of Sinaovation Venture, which has placed together one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed a artificial intelligence system at the Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the highest-ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he was head of Microsoft Research and head of Google's Chinese operations.
Lee welcomed the earlier technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when to identify future visionaries.
Lee says Americans working hard to get public aid.
"Academic agents don't take China, they're big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting university tops to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think those who have completed a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should be given automatically green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government’s next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
This year, the Department of Defence of the United States established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together industrial and academic world partners, and the White House has also announced the formation of a special committee of artificial intelligence.
DARPA was also announced this month for a $2 billion investment in AI Next initiative.
The NSF, in turn, invests more than 100 million dollars per year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative for the establishment of the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken place in months.
The Macedonians in the referendum on the amendment of the name of the country
In the Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to turn the name of the country into the "Pohjois-Makedonia Republic". The change of name would resolve a dispute with Greece, which has blocked the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns the region of Macedonia, considers that the name of the northern neighbours is practically a requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its access to EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries entered into an agreement on a new proposal for names, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the voting activity will reach the required 50 % limit so that the result is legal.
The question at the vote was: "You are on the part of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece".
The supporters of rollovers such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev explain that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, could seek to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote in favour of the future of our country, on behalf of the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska in Skopje, 79 years old.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they respect the result of the vote so that it can have a decisive effect.
The change of name requires two-thirds of the majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities were reported by 13 o’clock.
However, the voting activity was only 16, compared to 34% of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of those entitled to vote finally voted.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum on the name change of Macedonia on 30 September 2018 in Strumica on 30 September 2018. The change would open the way for NATO and EU membership .
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set chairs before a referendum on tents set up by boycotts in the Skopje Parliament.
"We contribute NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not through the kitchen door," Kavalarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to the other side, such as China and Russia as part of the integration of the euro area.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring needed investment in Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"The large majority of the people in Hungary voted in favour of a change of name because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev, after giving their voice.
He said "yes" to the voice is "damaging our future".
The opinion poll published by the political research institute in Macedonia on Monday referred to a vote of 30-43% in the referendum, i.e. the activity required below.
In another survey of the Macedonian Telma TV, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said that they would vote in favour of the option.
In order to succeed in a referendum, voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback to the Western-minded government when it came to power in May of last year.
See: Manchester City, Sergio Aguero, painted the whole Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear impression of Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the Etihad stadium in Manchester.
Aguero got the painting he made at 65 minutes to make it look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentinian top player was fed from the middle field.
He found an empty space on the field by crawling through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He missed one defender, and then left several others at the border of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty range to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton Warp Mathew Ryan goal with a shot in the right corner.
The City manager, Pep Guardiola, told the reporters that "Aguero has problems with his feet".
"We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Lucky for us, he scored in that time.
However, Sterling had already given the celestial advantage to the Poles in the struggle.
The painting came with 29 minutes of play.
Aguero was hit by a ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful passer to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few contact before sending the ball back to the back of the block towards Sterling.
The attacker in heaven just before the end of the line.

Scherzer wants to be a fan of joy in the fight against Rockies.
Nationals are out of the playoff fight, so why try a hard start?
However, Scherzer, one of his competitions, always hopes to take over the pitch in Sunday's match against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has a drop-off port, and they have one victory difference in the western series of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies caught at least a wild card with 5-2 wins from Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division victory.
"Although we don't have any stakes, we can get up to the pitch, knowing that the gap between the public and the other team here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive position I've faced this year.
Why would I not want to face the challenge?"
Nationals have not yet published their starter for Sunday, but according to the data, they tend to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, and he'd play 34 at the start of his fight and eat his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 profit/loss ratio this season. ERA statistics are 2.53 and he's burned the hitter's nest 300 times, while the peer statistics are 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to his Supreme Court judge in the situation of Brett Kavanaugh, who also spoke about the importance of the Republican voting activity in the field.
"All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the great ones -- not just campaigning, but campaigning full, and that's why I'm going all around to fight for the excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You will see this terrible radical group of democracies, you will see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to the wire by whatever means you can see their vanity and evilness.
They don't choose who's hurting or who's to be stoned so they can get to power, that's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said that the Democrats took the task of "responsibility and prevention".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "a hate and evil and evil and lying."
In reference to the most influential democratic elements in the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs in Dianne Feinstein, the public responded with a loud bout.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you get a document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, no, I'm looking forward to it. It was really bad for the body language... the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerance congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I wasn't really surprised when my local party Momentum activists supported the motion of censure against me.
Well, at least I'm just the last one of Labour's representatives to tell you that I'm not welcome, just because we're saying our opinion.
My parliamentary group, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he was firmly opposed to anti-Semitisms.
In my case, the motion of censure was criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corby.
The issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, are indeed ironic issues which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "We want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
The majority of the eight years that I have worked as a local representative of Labouri have been precisely this.
Now, many of the meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and the "friendly and more tender" policy has long since been forgotten if it ever started.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates different opinions and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is suitable for the party's leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues with whom I thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect a full translation and statements that I would never have agreed otherwise, whether national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - the result is that of insults in social media, which calls for my withdrawal, rejection of central policy, and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been made on me are at least political in nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who face sexist and racist insults every day and never worsen.
The normalisation of treatment is one of the most disturbing features of the policy of this era.
Last week Jeremy Corby insisted that the Labour Party adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party to accept different opinions, and with each motion of censure or change in the rule of law, the party becomes only more restrictive.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that everything would go well.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student in the wake of the failure of the Tatcher Government to attend a single school, I have been trying to promote better public services for those most needing them.
I've never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been surprised by my viewpoints or differences with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that, when the state is moving towards a brexite that is affecting households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my trust in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters: I represent you with honour, and the threat of separation or the promotion of political careers does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated on Ayr block edge
The last two minutes' goal was a bit distorted by the outcome of the match, but Ayr, without denying it, earned victory in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who has not lost any fights.
Finally, the excellent defence and a more successful take-up of risks was what supported them, and Coach Peter Murchie can therefore be pleased.
"We've been challenged in our fights and yet we're undefeated, so I can be happy." he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All glory to Ayri, they took risks better than us."
At 14 minutes, Ayr was in charge with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversion kick, but the Scottish captain Roy Hughes's yellow card was given to the Warriors match, and Jason Baggot made a goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in the penalty paintings, and just before the half-time, he scored the goal and managed the conversion kick by increasing Ayri's leadership to read 17-5.
But Melrose started the second piece well on Patrick Anderson's goal, which, in the conversion pot, Baggot managed to narrow the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruardh Knott was seriously injured and applied out of the field. As Ayr continued, he grew his lead on the Stafford McDowall goal, which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayri's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a hard pressure after a goal that was not successful in the conversion.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from Climo's anti-spainting, and Macpherson made a goal of the Ayri maul that left the side of the border.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and dragged Gregor Henry to finish his home team's fifth goal.
The star of the Still Game series starts in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, is appointed leader of the licensed restaurant company and thus begins working in the restaurant sector.
A 56-year-old actor present Jack Jarvis's recommendation on a BBC program that he's writing with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The twin has announced that the coming ninth season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kierna is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to the public register data, he has been registered as head of the company Driftmor Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the flourishing restaurant business of Glasgow.
"Meri belongs to us": Homeland Bolivia is trying to get back to the Pacific Ocean by law
Marines patrol the fleet outside La Paz.
The flags of public buildings will be suffocated by a blue flag.
The ship base for the Titicacalta Amazon has been stunned by an attack clause: "The sea is really ours.
Getting it back is our duty."
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost in the bloody 18th century in Chile is still strong – as is the case for us to sail on the Pacific Ocean once more.
The hope is at the highest in decades when Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has a strong progress, a common spirit and a sense of spirit, and, of course, a positive attitude in the waiting for a final solution," said the M.E. diplomat Roberto Calzad.
A number of Telegraphs from all over the country as hopeful as the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screens, hoping that the Hague will be in favour of – at the end of the long-term debate of decades – Bolivia’s view that Chile has an obligation to grant its own access to the sea.
The charismatic President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the contested battle next year, will have a great deal in the line next Monday.
"Back to the Pacific is very close," he convinced the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interest of Bolivia, and even if it were decided, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch institution does not have the power to give up Chilen administration, and the ICJ has announced that it will not impose on the end of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision will be adopted only six months after the final statements have been given suggests that the case "is not complex", says Paz Zárate, a chileinen expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia’s purpose.
"The current Bolivian regime has taken over the issue of maritime connections," Zárate said.
Morales' challenging rhetoric has stifled the rest of the chiles' charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations afterwards.
In both countries, there has been no second embassy since 1962.
The former President and the Boliviaan representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the Court's decision would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia the "exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop the differences of 139 years with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, should have used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to join the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The decision is a chance to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea reported that there would be no nuclear isolation unless it could be trusted with the United States of America.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first, unless they can trust Washington, said Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly.
He recalled the United States to keep the promises made by Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's position came just before the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is reinitiating the deadlock at nuclear weapons, only three months after the United States met in Kim Jong Unin Singapore.
Ri said that there is a 'long dream' to believe that the continued sanctions and the US resistance to the Korean declaration of end-of-war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken significant measures to promote the withdrawal of weapons, Washington will be guarded for the adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, the view that Pjongjang would have the intention of abandoning the armed forces, which the state probably sees as the only real means of ensuring its own safety, has received extensive doubts.
Pompeo is about to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump Summit.
Paris’s fashion show the largest sizes of mains in the latest collection, which are also near you.
If you want to magnify your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue looking.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed their SS19 in the exhibition a selection of special over-prisoned heads that would dazzle the style circles of the fashion weeks in Paris.
Very impractical heads took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide-scale feathersler, which covered the ends of the models almost completely.
Other oversized dwellings included watermelon, velveted and even ananas — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of distinctive masks – just before Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips, and they reminded Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creature with snorkel and mask reminded more of the diver, and the other reminded the feathered ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand for a large fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of the fashion predict that the huge peaks are about to appear in the street.
The oversized hats are strictly followed by "La Bomba", a straw hat with a six-foot liers, which has been seen from all Riha to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the unusual hat cult material, which is seen in high numbers, also made up of the molds of the second-cohesive creation — a straw box that is almost as large as the model to bear it.
The burned orange striped raffia with white leather armbands had the most striking creation of Jacques' La Riviera SS19 in Paris fashion patterns.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I see large hats and beach bags in the street picture next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale residents."
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for the people of the world
The results of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. The success has strengthened individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the SCSI of private schools in Scotland, seek to provide a high level of service to their students and students’ parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their careers, postgraduate and higher education, as well as for world citizenship.
As a training provider, which can plan and implement customized educational content, we have noticed the status of languages as a preferred and desirable subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to create relations with people in other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we find that the languages are at the top of the lists for the per cent pass between private schools.
68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
Based on this data, students who received the best rating A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French, and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently free-chosen substances, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural materials (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study programme and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey carried out by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it became clear that 17% of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding an appropriate employee were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary to promote the career development of young people.
The more possible tasks will require language skills, the more essential these skills will form in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he has the advantage in the future of this life-long skill, regardless of what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with the foreigner will automatically put a person with the language skills in front of the competition.
According to yourGov’s survey in 2013, over 4,000 adults in Isobritan are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and France was the only language with a double number of 15 per cent.
That is why it is important now to contribute to the teaching of languages for the children of today.
In particular, knowledge of the language of developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are expected to be important for the Isobritans in 2020, such as Mandarins and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interest, private schools always have a number of language options taught by specialised teachers.
In Scotland, private schools are determined to offer a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future will bring.
In this period, it cannot be denied that, in the international business environment, languages are still very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Today's languages should indeed be seen as "national communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and a high level for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the SCSI of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron's making a debut on Sunday in San Diego.
LeBron James's first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers lines is about to be over.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the beginning of the season in a game to play.
But how many minutes he'll really play will be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wanted me to tell you that James is probably playing silent minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week for his plans for Lakers before the six games to be played.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need any more pre-games to prepare," he said.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts the election campaign series today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathy, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his vote in order to fill the Supreme Court Judge's seat, Trump is seeking to increase support for forthcoming interim elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing a majority in Congress in November elections.
What time is Trump's Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The event of Trump's West Virginia Wheeling starts at 19 o'clock on Saturday, 29.9.2018.
You can view Trump's Western Virginia campaign event as an online live event through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump takes a position on the hearing of the Supreme Court of this week's Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who became agitated because of the accusations of sexual harassment that have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote, after all the charges raised in the FBI's investigation this week.
But the primary objective for the campaign is to support the success of the Republican candidates in tough November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign was commented on the five events of this week, with which he said, "to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The rule of kongress is so essential for his purpose that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign period," Trump's anonymous representative told Reuters.
Today's event is in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there can be supporters even from "Ohi and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" in West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to Western Virginia during the month in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Senator Patrick Morrisey of the Republican West Virginia, who has been left behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to increase his support for opinion polls," said state scientist Simon Haeder of West Virginia, after Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States Team shows the will to keep hope up ahead of Sunday's single game
After three unilateral sessions on Saturday afternoon, the four-games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-enhancing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe it, and more and more in tournaments like this.
Where is this success force with them right now?
"They had a six-point lead, which narrowed to four, so we take this success force as a leap," said Jordan Spieth walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage: four points ahead and 12 out of play.
The United States, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little windy sail and much encouragement from what, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, through which they played together all day and received three points from four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the roads to the green, leading by example.
As he moved forward, the horrendous holocausts of the victory feast strengthened as he succeeded in a critical tube to set the match straight to four, when he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
The Putt, in which they won the 15th match, followed a similar cry that gave an idea that he believes that the US team has not yet disappeared.
"You need to focus really well and take care of your own fight," Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an effect.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
A special but sweet twin in Europe has won four of the four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only twin that didn't do any bongs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way in which they give and get energy from this glamorous audience, confirms that they are the premiers of Sunday. And when the sun drops in Le Golf National, another more popular player to ensure Europe's potential gain could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather have both at the same time on different thighs.
However, talks about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly fell with Alex Noren, a paired Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the four-game game this morning.
One bong and two doublebogs on the first nine holes dug up the Spanish and Swedish so deep that they were not even near to survive there.
But on Sunday, no one will come to help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and four-games are fascinating to follow from a close point of view of cooperation: What kind of advice they give or do not give, and how the strategy can change in the moment.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-game has shown that the US team has a struggle, even though it has been suspected in particular in the United States.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead before Ryder Cup's last day
Europe will be in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup after they took the 10-6 lead from the United States of America on Saturday's four-balls and four-games.
An excellent twin, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the victory of two winnings from the rapper Tiger Woods, and got the score to a height of four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, who worked hard to maintain his victory two years ago in Hageltina, was weakly controlled by the U.S. team of the United States in the morning in four ball, taking the match to a situation of 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday 12 to keep the victory.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood", were the second twin in the history of Ryder Cup after the sensational weekend, which has won four points in the first four games.
After first breaking four balls of Woods and Patrick Reed, they were overcompared by the overcrowded Woods and the U.S. initiative by Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who barely survived Saturday's two fights, was from time to time very great, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four games, and even seven consecutive.
Justin Rose rested the morning with four balls, but he and Henrik Stenson returned to the four-game, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third to the beach.
Europe did not have everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The three-time prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the United States on Saturday.
They're going to get a meaningful 2-1 victory in Spain from Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and later 4-3 victorys from Poulter and Rory McIllroy in four games after the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has risen from four points behind the drive to levels when the double game starts, even though Furyk's side also has a game to maintain victory.
Although two days after being the second best, it can be that Sunday’s counterattack has been too much to ask for.
North Korea "not in any name" takes itself away from weapons without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has done "important measures of good will" during the last year, such as completed nuclear and missile tests, broken down a nuclear test site and promised that North Korea would not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"But we haven't seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure that national security is maintained, so under such circumstances, it is not possible to take our arms off unilaterally."
However, while Ri repeated the familiar complaint stream that Washington did not accept phased-out of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every aspect, it is important for his opinion to be that one-sided arms withdrawal is not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has done before.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US President and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on 12 June, in his opinion Kim convinced that the Korean peninsula would be cut off from nuclear weapons, and Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought to formally decide the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has called for Pjongjang to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States has called for 'until the first', and they have increased the pressure of sanctions to achieve their goal with the help of the people – even against 'the peace declaration', Ri said.
"Responsibility for sanctions to get us on our knees is an immediate desire for those who wish.
But the problem is that continued sanctions only deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump Summit, however, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with Mr Moon Jae-in of South Korea in the last five months and added: "If South Korea and the United States had been a party that had requested the arms to be removed, the situation would not have advanced to such a dead end."
However, Rin's tone of voice was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States' continents was inevitable after the "bad President" Trump called Kim a "controlman" equipped with suicide.
Yet last year, Trump threatened "to completely destroy" North Korea. However, this year, Trump rangly praised Kim for his courage to approach the arms drop, but stressed that there is still much work to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he had no timeline: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia submitted that the UN Security Council should reward PjongJang for the progress already made.
However, on Thursday, Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, said to the UN Security Council, "The strengthening of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong and failure until we bear witness to the abandonment of the full, final and confirmed nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of suffocating the financial channels for Pjongjang's ballistic and nuclear missile production.
Mr Pompeo met in the context of the North Korean Rin UN General Assembly and announced that he would return to Pjongjang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times during this year, but the last visit was not smooth.
When he left Pjongjang, he described progress as being made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterical requirements" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to closing the missile base and the nuclear facility at the meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month, in the event that the United States takes "comparative measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "comparative measures" to which Trump was committed at the Singapore meeting and the transition towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course that guides sufficient rest
The course is against the flowering macho culture at the University of Harvard, where students weigh long nights with caffeine power.
According to the researcher, students at the world’s best university are often quite ignorant of their own well-being in fundamental matters.
Professor Charles Czeisler of the University of Harvard Medical Science, who works for a sleep study in Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the first class of his species is in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for a course after he was lectured on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"After my reading, a young woman came to me, who said, "Why am I not hearing this until now, my last year of study?"
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he said in his interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year's course will guide students from how true dreams support academic and sporting performances as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Medical Science at Harvard University and Vice President of the University Health Services, says that the university has completed a course after they have heard how students suffer from serious sleep losses during the academic week.
An hour's course includes a set of interactive tasks.
One section gives students a picture of the apartment room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information about the effects of caffeine and light as well as the impact of sleep shortages on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section explains how long-term sleep loss can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate effect on students' behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these issues in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, the long-lasting studies throughout the night are still subject of pride, and today's technology and the growing pressure of students made the growing problem of sleep shortages.
"A sufficient and high quality sleep should be against the stress, fatigue and anxiety of students, and even against the increase in weight, as sleep loss causes a state of hunger in the brain, which is why man is constantly hungry", Professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology, was helping Professor Czeisler in the design of the course after he had participated in one of his teaching courses during the first year of Harvard.
He tells us that the course opened his eyes and gave a boost to all campus students for a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all further students would be able to complete a similar study group before moving to a competitive spirit institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students be given an alarm clock to remind them not only of sleep time but also of morning awakening and urges them to keep in mind the side effects caused by electronic display devices and LED lighting "Blue light" for daily rhythms, which may make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan launch took victory at Gerardi's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again experienced a new loss-making day when Dolly Mengan's launch broke out of defense brought Livingston a 1-0 victory.
Ibrox’s players were about to pick up their first victory since February 4-1, a game that was fought against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt’s team won this time, and Gerrad was now only experiencing his second defeat during his 18-game manager’s career.
Menga fired the ball goal seven minutes before the half-time, and there was no longer a set-off situation at the fall of the Rangers.
The Rangers fell to the sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to the third place, and the goal difference is to the upper part of Hibernia only.
The Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game as the object thrown out of the game hit the head, and the wound has been taken care of.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for a team that had hit Ayri and made progress on the semifinals of the Scottish league.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 assembly, where the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy produced the result again when a well-structured assembly managed to discipline the opponent in almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations for its own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to get a goal in two minutes, when Mengan's first feed gave Scott Pittman a free way to the goal of Allan McGregor. However, Pittman did not succeed in taking advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, managed only to launch a wide-ranging backdoor.
Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but the last third of the game in the air was no longer self-security.
Alfredo Morelos insisted on punishment for fifteen minutes after he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly rejected the bother of Lassana Coulibaly's bag and Ovie Ejaria's undefeated shot.
Livingston's goal for 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
Rangers couldn't still do anything to Jacobs' long pass-over tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who could coolly hit the ball for Menga.
At the switch, Gerrard decided to switch Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The switch almost immediately affected the game when Kent created a suitable hole for Morelos. However, the attack interrupted Kelly's impact on the speedy defense.
Livingston allowed visitors to play their own game again when Lithgow and Halkett continued long passers after each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to raise its lead in the last moments of the game, but McGegor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could get into position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who became a Rangers exchange, also insisted that the penalty be taken together with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanakka: Geigerometer inventor
The next page of our newspaper "Sunday Morning" was the 30th day of September 1882. John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physics, was born in Germany this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a gay meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also the central concept of pop culture. For example, the film "Coronado watches" in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present scientists who are quite affected by the shepherd:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigerometer, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look at it, now it's really a raid!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system “see” malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system “see” malignant cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method is used to isolate resistant cells from the patient and to change them in the laboratory.
After processing, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the typical proteins for several cancers.
The tissue has given promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, cancer cells in patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The method is used to isolate resistant cells from the patient and to change them in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2-proteins for many cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "Our results indicate a highly promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer", Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and cancer of ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach – taking resistance cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West had to go to critics' teeth after praising the Trumpia Saturday Night Lives campaign hat on his head.
The performance did not go according to the plans
Kanye West received his neck of the parades in Saturday Night Live's entertainment program, praising the stellar style of President Donald Trump and declaring himself to be president in the elections in 2020.
After presenting his third song "Ghost Town" Trump's Make America Great Again, the campaign force in West attacked the Democrats and repeated its support for President Trump.
"When talking to a white man, they ask me how I can support Trumpmi because he's racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
Tonight's transmission began on a scale in which Matt Damon was agitated to consult Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Justice Committee. The hearing relates to the allegations made by Christine Blasay Ford about Kavanaugh's sexual harassment.
No direct transmission was made from the West, but the comic book Chris Rock downloaded it into the social media.
It's unclear whether Rock's purpose is to mock West with his post.
In addition, the West complained to the public about having been treated in the bowls because of the hat it held on its head.
"I was persecuted behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I'm on the margin," West says at the Washington Examer interview.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be in the margin?" and says that you're wearing your Superman sign, because "Then you can't make me do what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Variety, West’s comments were at least twice as loud as the audience, and the performers of the show seemed embarrassed. One of the people present described the situation to the paper as follows: “The whole studio was completely quiet.”
West was elected in a short warning period to replace Aria Grande, whose former boyfriend, a rapper of Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
In many viewers, West caused confusion by the presentation of "I love it" as a bottle of Perrier.
West will receive support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA organisation Candace Turner, who praised this courage on Twitter: "KIITOS KUN UHMASIT ROSKAKE".
However, the author of the discussion programme, Karen Hunter, pointed out that West "is only itself, which is absolutely wonderful".
"I can decide, however, that I should like to make a decision on whether to buy this music or clothing or to support this "art", which I consider to be damaging to my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us," he added.
The rapper announced that he had changed his name on Twitter before he appeared on Twitter, as a "person known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows here Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember Prince of the late music legend, who changed his name to a symbol and later as an artist known as Prince.

Actor Kit Harington is attacking toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword’s glamorous hero role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series of HBO.
However, Harrington has attacked the machosankar stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Association, Harrington believes that something "has gone wrong" and questions the means to address the toxic masculine #MeToo phenomenon in the era.
Recently, Harrington, a member of the Board of Governors’ cart, including a 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculine is, at the moment, a strong feeling in me," he says.
"What have men been taught about their growth in years that have led to the problems that are now being observed?"
Harrington believes that television and very masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculine.
He goes, "What's inside and what's learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I believe that this is one of the big questions of our day – how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong."
In his interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the pre- or downstream parts of the court game after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, "has been required of the fields and horses."
In November Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play on True West, which tells us about the film producer and this kidnapper brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future Rose wife was the best thing he ever offered him.
"I met my wife in this show, so somehow it gave me my future family and my life from then on" she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygrite, the object of Jon Snow's love of Harrington's show at Emmy's prize fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at the Leslie family’s premises in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported an increase of 14% in HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 people's lives in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan County Conference, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of HIV infected and AIDS infected patients in China has increased by 100 000 cases.
The HIV infection via sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against people with LGBT has been reported to be common.
The studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married to women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many diseases are due to insufficient protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the general availability of HIV medicines as part of the action to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data of the employee's leaked Republicanizer and accused of spreading dangerous lies and "salive union theories".
On Saturday, Mr Maxine Waters, member of the United States Assembly, challenged the claims that his staff would have published personal data on the Wikipedia pages of the three Republican senators.
A democratic representative from Los Angeles assured us that there are “right-of-right” commentators and websites.
"The light, lies, and more despised lies," says Waters, in his opinion published on Twitter.
It is reported that there were the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham and senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing the State of Utah.
An unknown person released information from the United States Congress during the hearing of the Senate Committee on Thursday, the hearing concerned allegations of sexual abuse against Brett Kavanaugh.
The bleeding occurred a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Punds and RedState report that, according to Hill's newspaper, messages were published by an IP address attached to Waters' office and by a person belonging to Waters' staff.
"This unwarranted accusation is completely wrong and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these unfair and false accusations, are not in any form responsible for the leaking of these data.
This unwarranted accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and critics also attended the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The man in whom he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fletcher.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to be hostile.
There's no reason for pride.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
The situation must behave moderately and calmly."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, accused of excessive hostility during the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who competes at Waters' place during Congress's sessions, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he said.
Waters announced in his opinion that he had contacted 'the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these unfair accusations.
"We make sure the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they are placed legally responsible for all the destructive and dangerous measures taken by some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English will strike again – the under-active Rowan Atkinson agentboard
The tradition has already established to look for brexit references from any film that is popular to Britain. However, this does not appear to be a suitable Johnny English agent for a series of working media, which started in 2003 with Johnny English, and relived in the following part "Johnny English – Newborn".
Can the tongue of a nation in the cheek become a new national export success in Britain?
Yes, or so, an ass-eyed, rubber-faced and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to repeat the tyranny, and even his name tells us, above all, that this is a collection of creation aimed at a film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, about a sneaky secret agent who desperately tries to breathe around the melting glamour, but it appears to be a mix of inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the unhappy one-time musician at the London opening concert for 2012.
The figure is based on the cosmopolitan and mystic world man left behind from chaos, which Atkinson originally presented in the forgotten Barclaycard TV movies.
I mean, there's a moment in the latest show.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on a helicopter in a medieval grip, and his helmet is clashed by rotors.
Atkinson's physical comedy gifts are coming out, but the humor itself seems to be underactive and unusually unnecessary, especially because “serious” movie brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task, are now offering humor as part of the main content of the film.
The humor seems to be directed to children, and I do not think Johnny's mixed treatment of English seems as inventive and sharp as the comet of Mr. Bean's mike.
Each year's repeated starting point is that Britain is the worst in trouble.
Cyber hacker has been involved in the UK's top spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents on the ground as a tyranny of an active agent — presented as Kevin Eldon's unfortunate low role performance.
This is the last drop for the important and long-term prime minister, who is already ready for the political disadvantage: Emma Thompson will do everything in Teresa May's Parody character, but the script does not offer him enough space.
When the intelligence advisors inform him that all the spies on the field have been exposed, we must call upon someone who has already left active service.
It is, of course, in its own personal personality of the fuck-up Johnny English. He spends his retirement days as a teacher at a fine school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the nobles of spying. The topic is to exorcise some clever jokes; English thinks of the school of Rock-type lessons in the field of intelligence.
English will be thanked for the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet again his infinitely patient battle partner Bough, who will continue to play Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to her rights.
Thus, the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to face the fateful super delinquent Ophelia Bhuletova of Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is becoming the most manipulating of the charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, acting as Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve the problems of the British computer.
English and Bough’s odyssey will turn into a farce: a double dressed as waitresses will set a fine French restaurant on fire and cause chaos while trying to cover the former luxury yacht. The company will get to the former house with the help of virtual ones will end up in clean anarchy in the real world.
Even when the final stage of the performers comes to the final scene, the film still seems a bit like a child audience, despite all the inability and charm.
You can think of the movie as a fair face.
When watching Johnny English movies, I've already come to the same conclusion: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for four-day work week with five-day salary
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but the salary would be paid five days later.
The party is reported to be demanding corporate leaders to transfer the savings generated by the revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, workers could enjoy three days' weekends on the same salary.
According to the source, the idea of the economic agenda of the party and its plans to cut the policy for the benefit of the workers.
The Association of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means of enabling workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of the high-level working party tells the Sunday Times newspaper: "The review of the list has been announced before the end of the year.
This change will not take place at the moment, but the four-day working week is the objective of a party's approach to economic balance for workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to support the transition to a four-day working week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective shall not receive indivisible support in the lines of Labourin.
The report by the Labour Party states: "Nonday's working week is not the party's orientation, and the party's not considering such a transition."
John McDonald, Minister for Finance of the shadow government, took advantage of the work conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonald said he was determined to regain power from "farmless dictators" and "industrators" of public interest companies.
According to the shadow government finance minister's plans, current shareholders of water companies would not be allowed to return their share in full, as the government led by Labour could act on the basis of the abuses identified as “reductions”.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in the management of companies and to create inclusive equity funds, which would allow 10% of the private sector's equity capital to be transferred to the management of employees, with a maximum of 500 pounds per year for individual employees.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing the 60-minute programme as to whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh's accusations have delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as judge of the Supreme Court, and the delay also raises the question of whether the result of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's name.
In the 60 minutes program to be sent on Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out what they could do to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolian colleague.
"Well, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you by the time I went to the hearing... I said I've been having a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the accusations came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unanimous."
The sound of Graham, instead, looks like the stone's broken.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's a bomb-proof one," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added Christine Blasay Ford.
"Not one of the people he appointed could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see what could change."
What is Global Civil Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citize Festival in New York will be a music event with the performance card as impressive as its mission: the elimination of poverty from the world.
For the seventh time, Global Civil Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of the New York Central Park to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real objective of the event: the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival, which started in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Powery Project, an international advisory group aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people active in the eradication of poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (if it is not willing to pay VIP flag), the public must perform various tasks or "acts", such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to the political decision-makers or make a call, or carry out any other action that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citize been successful now that the goal is no longer 12 years?
Is the idea of paying free concerts a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one among others – an idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a sign?
Global Citize reports on the "work" made in favour of more than 19 million goals since 2011.
According to it, these actions have encouraged policy makers to report commitments and principles that account for over $37 billion and have been used in a way that affects more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations, which accounted for over $10 billion already used or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved so far have had an impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, the Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives operating in the United Kingdom, which is committed to 'helping children to their full potential'. The group committed itself to providing Rwanda with $35 million in order to end malnutrition in the country. This happened after the activists sent them 4 700 TV sets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"The British Government, donors, governments of different countries and, just like you, the people of the world, we can transfer to the press of the history of social injustice and malnutrition", The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman said to the public at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the Group, the British Government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of the mothers and children by more than 5,000 actions.
One of the often asked questions on the movement's website is: "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's answer: "This is going to be long and difficult, and there are many compact stones in front of us.
We will, however, succeed, as great civil rights struggles and apartheid countermeasures before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are running a New York concert this year, and its star map includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mona.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Interior, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as a "progress"
According to the US Secretary of Interior of the Washington Examer magazine Ryan Zinke, Washington can "where necessary" rely on its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy, including the immediate ones on the world market.
Zinke claims that Russian activities in Syria — the invitation of a legitimate government — are an excuse for the recognition of new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the cause of [Russia]'s presence in the Middle East is energy transmission, just as it is said in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe".
According to the authorities, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep ship routes open with its fleet and, if necessary, to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market" he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, which is an unprofitable group profiled as a "voting noise" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it was one thing.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel by another," he says, and describes Russia as a "one-step circus number", which is based on fossil fuels.
The statements are due to a situation in which Trump's administration has sought to increase the efficiency of exports of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace it with significantly cheaper Russian liquid gas.
In order to make this more effective, Trump's administration, including President Trump, will try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unusual" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to President Trump, binds Berlin to the winter youth of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transfer capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of the existing tube.
The Kreml claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington’s opposition and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure, and that consumers must have the opportunity to choose its supplier" says Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy, after meeting US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has led to a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial roofing organisation, the German industrial union, has called on the United States to stay separate from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that the third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German industrial union recently, after the meeting of the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, will carefully consider the "offence" in the presidential elections in 2020
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced that he would "be careful" to be a presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidates at an open questionnaire in Holyok, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our flawed government, and this means also a woman at the head of the kingdom," he said according to The Hill.
After the sixth day of November, I intend to carefully consider being a presidential candidate.
Warren estimates President Donald Trumpic's opportunity to say "it's taking the country the wrong way".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared in plain terms when criticizing Trump and this Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in the series Warren wrote, "of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
According to the opinion poll published on Thursday, however, the majority of Warren’s voters do not support this situation in 2020.
According to research conducted by the Suffolk University Policy Research Institute and Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of becoming a candidate.
32% supported candidateisation.
Several of the respondents supported the former governor Deval Patrick's position on the 38% condition, while 48% opposed the idea.
For example, in other debates, the prominent democratic candidates for the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden has stated that he will formally decide on his candidate by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war crimes at Donald Trump's election.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, served a year in Iraq after recruiting the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night, and there were charges of domestic violence.
"What my own son will have to go through when I return home, I can identify well with other families who will face the consequences and injuries of PTSD that our soldiers return home," he told the public in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest “flowing horse in the living room” and said his son, as other war veterans “responsible at home a little, they come back a few times, and they wonder whether they will respect what he and his partner in the army and in the Air Force have done for this country.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wass, Alaska, where Dan Bennett, a police informant of Wassilla, accused of domestic violence and assault on women, and of domestic violence and the handling of the gun.
18 states and the Columbia Federation support the new asylum policy step
Eighteen states and the Columbia Federation are seeking a change in the new direction that has entered into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and the alliance have left the letter of justice on Friday in Washington. The letter supports the break-in asylum seekers of NBC News.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal order.
He tells his partner "and his sons of violent gangs" he was abused by the U.S. authorities who denied him asylum for 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, a large part of which are asylum seekers from the United States, as countries where gang and domestic violence are a problem at all levels of society.
The U.S.’s new asylum policy repealed the decision taken by the Board of Appeal for asylum applications in 2014, according to which non-documented migrants have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, General Prosecutor of the Columbia Federation, commented in his opinion on Friday that the new line "is ignored by States, the federal state and international law for decades".
The law of the flag State requires all applications for asylum to be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances on which the application is made, and such an obstacle is a violation of this principle by the letter of friends of the law.
The prosecutors also claim that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from entering is detrimental to the US economy, because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "the necessary additional labour force".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges to suspend the granting of asylum from victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The place of refuge is intended for persons who escape their country because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or a particular class of society", the Sessions announced in its opinion of 11 June of the new asylum policy.
The asylum was never meant to solve all problems — even serious problems — that people face daily throughout the world.
Desperate survivors’ rescue efforts in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled
To the survivors, the situation becomes even more serious.
"Tilanne is very intense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, having satisfied her hot baby Please stay at an evacuation center in a desolated city.
"The ambulances will bring new bodies from one minute to another.
Clean water is running low."
The inhabitants are returning to their destroyed homes, picking up their watered goods and trying to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured, and 7,5 hospitals damaged by magnetized extremities are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from the fracture of the spine and shoulder, are resting outside the military hospital, where patients are being treated for persistent, severe sequelae.
His eyes are filled with tears when he begs how fierce an earthquake shaken the fifth floor of the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris tells me about Associated Press and tells me that he was in town with his family as wedding guests.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then I got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accused China of 'provolution' by 'propaganda announcements'
A week after the Chinese newspaper has been published in a US daily magazine, four-page advertisements to promote the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement will be charged with the use of Beijing American magazine.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the Chinese Daily magazine as paid in the Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, indicted of Chinese interference in the 6th 11 congresses.
Trump's allegations of Beijing's attempts to get involved in US elections mean a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for the foreign government to spread notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-exploiting trade war, where both parties are in turn ordering customs duties on the exports of the counterparty.
According to Chinese and American experts, the Chinese revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese Ambassador and long-term governor of the state of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the US labour force, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a large exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now stimulating its provocations further by publishing propaganda declarations in our own free press", wrote Branstad in his opinion paper published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
By resting its propaganda, the Chinese Government benefits from US appreciation for free word and press traditions by setting a paid declaration to Des Moines Register, Branstad writes.
"In the blockades of the streets of Peking, differing opinions appear only in a limited manner, and there are real, different opinions that Chinese citizens can see from the alarming development of their economies, and this is because the media is tightly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of the largest newspapers in China claimed to publish the offer" article he wrote, but not to mention what the paper is about.
Kavanaugh-fiasko banishes female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the feuding Republicans stand behind the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and defend him may, according to analysts, lead to a reaction, especially in the forthcoming elections with female voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have taken a major turn, and most Republicans have already announced their wish to proceed in the vote.
"You can't cancel these things," says Professor Grant Reeher from Syracuse University, Maxwell, Institute of Science, The Hill magazine, published on Saturday.
Reeher doesn't believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona) last minute's offer of the FBI investigation is resting on the angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and the national reform group, according to MoveOn's newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang "the November to come", expressing their view of the Senate's ruling Republicans of Justice when deciding to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh, which took place despite the statement of testimony by Dr. Christine Blasay Ford, Mik report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable," says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in interviewing the news site.
People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and it is true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the uncertain female voters in the neighbourhood and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29 who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts anticipate a possible response if the Republicans advance with confirmation even before Ford’s statement of testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he claimed sexual harassment.
"This is going to be a mess with the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, to the NBC News news channel at the beginning of last week.
"The question is not just about the vote of the Committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be called into question; it is about how the Republicans have acted on it and how they have been treated by Fordia, Guy Cecil, U.S. Director of Priorities supporting the Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem rather divided in their belief in Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony as the majority tended to the latter.
According to yourGov's new opinion, 41% of respondents believe that Ford's witness statement is absolutely or probably, while 35% say that he is absolutely or probably speaking of Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely or definitely lied in his witness statement, whereas only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's push forward, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one of the charges of Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian's report.
In front of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Ford testifiedly before the Committee on Legal Affairs, trying to harass Kavanaugh when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court had revealed to him his wife at the student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, has launched a startup company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source of source of Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any information.
In an interview by Fast Company Berners-Lee, the aim of Inrupt is to "control the world".
"It has to be done now," he said referring to his startup attempt.
"There's a historic moment in the case."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal database", i.e. POD.
It may include contact lists, memory lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
In a personal repository, unique is the fact that it is fully occupied by the user who has access to which type of information.
The company calls it "the personal entry into force of data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Leen, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some employed developers working with the project, and a community consisting of voluntary coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website. This is all available from this week on.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't discuss "Facebook and Google as to whether people should be offered a perfect change in which all their business models will be translated into their capital in one night".
"We will not ask their consent to the matter."
In his article published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote Inrupt 'the task of providing commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid'.
In 1994 Berners-Lee mullist was established on the Internet by the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as founder and leader of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, as well as following the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest who has been awarded Victoria Cross in England since 100 years of events.
The military medal was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918, as a result of the attacks on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehuaucourt.
However, the bath died of a sniper four days later without ever knowing that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandkids were about to reveal a monumental stone at a parade in Ruhden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, says the event is a "similar symbol"; the monument was revealed about 100 years after his awarded grandfather's career.
According to London Gazette, 29 9.1918, Colonel Vann led his Battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent "in a tight fog and under heavy field guns and machine rifles."

Friends of the free game waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV show showed Pipsa Possua
Imagine the situation in which you've been monitoring all night to watch the scheduled Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event is not presented.
The San Jose event programme had 13 matches, six of which were the main matches, and the show was to be presented as a direct broadcast on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed into a great knockout of Pipsa Posku’s viewers.
Some of the viewers were not really happy to watch over their entire night’s fight.
One of the friends of the free match opened up on Twitter, describing the replacement of the match in children's drawing "a kind of sick joke."
According to the law, this content was not suitable for presentation at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to change it for the children's program" explained Dave Schwartz, the senior director of the Bellator's marketing and communication programme.
"Pipsa Possu, yes."
Scott Coker, the director of the Bellator company, said that the timetables will be worked so that British viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a new mission to probably get the program to work," Coker said.
"But the bell will be there in the morning, and we will not be allowed to present the program before Sunday, which is Monday morning for their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed into their heads, messages began to go in the direction and the other, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're cutting the number of matches instead of five instead of six, as usual, and we tried to offer our fans more and we tried too hard.
This is a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt underrated due to his sexuality
The swimmer and the Olympic athlete Tom Daley tell us that he's feeling inferior to all others because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says that he didn't just notice when he came to high school that "all aren't like me".
Lauren Laverne, speaking in the Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4, tells me that she has spoken about gay rights to give other people the 'good'.
He also tells us how to win Olympics after having a child was no longer so important.
The regular driver of a long-term radio program, Kristy Young, has taken several months of free disease.
When playing as a guest in the first program in Laverne, Daley told me that he felt himself as a youth ‘lesser than everyone else,’ because "it was not socially acceptable to consider boys and work".
He says, "To this day these feelings, they have felt smaller and different since they have given me the power and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says he wanted to show himself to be ‘some’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality would eventually be revealed.
The double Olympic prossimisticist has become a high profile LGBT activist, and he is present in this year's national community's competitions in order to criminalise homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt fortunate to live openly without sanctions, and he wanted to give ‘sad’ to other people.
A three-time world champion tells of his love for a man — a American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "a surprise".
Daley got married to his 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he says that the age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things when you were so young" – he took part in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – "it is difficult to find another of the same age who would have experienced similar side-effects," Dale says.
The couple received the boy in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Dale's "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have rolled around winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than the golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son received his name according to Daley's father, who died of brain cancer only at 40 years of age in 2011.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the most recent things he asked him about was the 2012 Olympic tickets, and he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he's not gonna be there anymore to be on the front line," Dale says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. Only after she really stopped breathing and she was dead, I finally realized that she was not vulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bonus.
"I knew this was something I've dreamed of all my life – jump in front of the audience at the Olympics. There is no better feeling," Dale says.
This was also a source of inspiration for his first song election – Heather’s song “Proud” – which raised feelings when he was preparing for the Olympic Games, and who still gets his skin on the chicken meat.
Desert Island Disco will be sent on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. BST.
Surrounded for Mickelson switch bench on Saturday in Ryder Cup
The U.S. Phil Mickelson is breaking record on Sunday by playing 47th Ryder Cup tour, but he must be very disappointed to avoid being a record tour in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays in the event of two years of play every once in a record 12 times, moved from Captain Jim Furyk to the swap bench for Saturday's football and Foursome.
The five-time Major Tournament winner, who is usually the center of the attention, now spent half of the day as a cheerleader and the other half trying to get his punch under control.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, not even held at the top of his career as one of the most specific drivers, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National site where a long-growing caricature punishs the unimportant ones.
If there is not enough opposition to Mickelson himself in the field, in the ninth game on Sunday, there will be a well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to bring down all four winnings this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 double games, get a flying departure, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but what else could you say in a situation?
"He totally understood the role he played in today. He killed me in the back, a little bit, and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play two games.
I had other thoughts, but I saw this go and we ended up with this sort of solution.
He wants to be out there as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldon's record of more played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It may also mean the end of a man’s Ryder Cup which, however, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and seven semis, but Fury says his presence brings something unspecified to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, keeps people at the expense of the prank, and he's a funny guy that everyone likes to follow," he explains.
"More players must have had fun with him this week. It has to be fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his bets in the game."
The European team Captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the leadership can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup's leading position before the last day's double games can become a rough trip.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros, led by five points in front of the Americans, but who survived as winner in the blizzard lines right now and just won his nose and won with the largest possible margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds us of how we were running in Valderrama, we were running a hole in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, although scarcely," said Bjorn after looking at the 5-3 wins for the 2018 team both Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-6 line of Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim for it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play for us, but we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world."
I'm glad that his team's players have been made out of a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I'll never lick until I drop out on such matters.
Tomorrow's a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, there will be individual performances, and then there will be different issues.
It is wonderful to be on the field with the partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player's capacity will be tested at the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be sent to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now we have to give up a partner who can also go to [to the place alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite captain Jim Furyk comes to the needs of his players as better performance individuals than they were able to do as partners. By way of exception, this is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk has experienced the last day's full translations in both directions, and he was involved in a team that won Brookline before he ended up as a loser when the European team won "Medinah's miracle".
"I remember every word of evil," he answered the question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw handed out the lines of his team to the test of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as it happened in Brookline, or as it happened in Medinah.
When it comes to moving in one direction, it pours a lot of pressure on the middle fields.
We've set up our formation accordingly and put the boys on the field in the way we want, as you know, we're going to do wonders tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead a defense fight and he's facing Rory McIllroy's most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next meeting their European opponents.
"I put the guys in this order, because I think it's going through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his two-game choices.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The German fleet's latest fregatti should have been introduced in 2014. The ship's aim is to replace obsolete cold-war equipment, but will be put in place at the earliest next year due to fregating systems and explosively growing costs, will be reported by local media.
According to the military informant who spoke to Die Zeit, the introduction of the new ship of the Baden-Württemberg Fregettberg has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying after-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four ships of Baden-Württemberg ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bregats of the Bremen class.
According to the available data, they are equipped with an efficient cannon, missile systems for the control of aircraft and surface vessels, as well as with oxidising technology such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signals.
The important features of the ship include its longer service range – new frregats should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without going to the home port.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the warships, the top of the technology, are said to be aimed at improving the German influence in the overseas regions, are already obsolete at the time they enter the service, the Die Zeit notes.
The bad-lucked F125-fregate ended up in headlines last year, when the German fleet refused to formally apply the platform and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the fleet will return the ship after it has been delivered.
A little is known for the reasons for the return, but the German media has been talking about the essential “software and equipment errors” that make warships unfit for combat tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the crew of ships of the Baden-Württemberg class is around 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bregat class.
It was also shown that the vessel is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s potential to subsequent updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz's capacity of 7 000 tonnes is believed to be twice the weight of ships of the corresponding category used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to incomplete equipment, there is also a problem about the price base for the whole project.
The price is multiplied by the sum of EUR 3.1 billion, when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The new problems with the use of the Fregates have emerged since the German maritime authorities have recently been warned of shrinking.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that fleets of usable vessels "are going to the least".
According to the Authority, the problem has increased over time due to the removal of old ships, but no new ones have been submitted.
He complained that none of Baden-Württemberg's frregates could have been used by the Navy.
The Environment Organization is eavesdropping the bats' secret life
A new study in the Scotland Highlands seeks to find out how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
The new research is expected to bring new light to these unique flying mammals' behaviour and guide them in future conservation measures.
In a study carried out by scientists from National Trust for Scotland, trouble-and-peel bags, as well as earflys and water traps are monitored in the Inverewe Garden area of Wester Ross.
The study sets out specific recording devices for monitoring the operation of bats in the region during the period.
The organisation’s employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of sounding and the species to which it is all about shall be ensured by the analysis of experts.
On the basis of the results, a map and report on the environment will be created in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a comprehensive picture of the size of the region.
Rob Dewar, the organisation's natural conservation advisor wishes to reveal the results which areas of the living environment are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
The information will be helpful in the design work of the habitats, such as the creation of sows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and associated species.
The population of Scotland and the UK's entire bat populations have fallen considerably over the last hundred years.
Building and construction work threatens resting places and living environments of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, due to night hunting practices, their ears are more useful in catching catches than in the eyes.
The bats use advanced echoing techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation focusing on the protection of the rural environment that sustains more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land — and they take the rest seriously.
There are ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections at rest and, in some cases, rescue activities for animals.
The organization has even set up the first and only countries to protect bats in the area of Dumafries and Galloway in Scotland, where eight out of the ten leak oils will be met in Scotland.
According to Nurse David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave fits the bats very well," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
We do not know everything yet, so our work here and in other parts of the organization will help us to understand better what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking the buildings in case of bats prior to taking part in renovations, as the destruction of one of the bats can inevitably cause up to 400 female bats and the death of the boy and destroys the entire local population.
The bats are protected by animals and their killing, harassment or destruction of resting sites are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the leek protection organisation, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and yet we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a case against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been marked by rape charges against him as "renewable" and says that people want to "noise themselves" by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken up the allegations that he has released the German newspaper Der Spiegel for questioning.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Lasvegasian hotel in 2009.
He is said to have paid the victim 375 000 dollars of silence, Der Spiegel reporting on Friday.
In the Instagram direct broadcast, a total of 142 million followers appeared only hours after the claim was made. 33-year-old footballers strongly rejected the charges and described them as "renewable".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," five times the Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player continued to smile.
Ronado's lawyers are preparing to challenge Der Spiegel for the claims they have called the Reuters News Office for "unqualified to report any suspicions under privacy protection".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player is demanding compensation for "serious sufferings according to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have met at the nightclub and moved to the player's room, where he claims to have been raped by an analyte, according to the papers provided by the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was "a 99% good guy", but whose "one percent" was disappointing.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that he had had sex with a couple, but it was a mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she has visited the police station and that she has taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later concluded a conciliation solution because she had been "in fear of the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that she would "be the subject of public humiliation".
A 34-year-old now says that he is seeking annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronando was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overthrow of Manchester United, and moved to the Italian powerful team for Juventus with a $ 100 million agreement.
Brexit: United Kingdom "to regret forever" end of car manufacturing
The UK would "loss forever" if it were to lose its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after brexit, Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered it "tolerable" to temporarily suspend production in his factory near Burnaston, Derby, if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
A Japanese car manufacturer says the effect of the restrictions on the visible job losses if brexix is to be concluded without agreement.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis models were manufactured nearly 150 000 cars last year, and 90% of them were exported to the European Union.
"It is my view that if Britain suddenly withdraws from the EU at the end of March, we will be in production with interruptions," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Timothy Burnaston Unit.
Other car manufacturers operating in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about the exit from the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its Mini manufacturing plant for a month when the brexit is complete.
The most important concern is the reporting by car manufacturers to address the risks related to the supply chain in the event of a non-contractual break-in.
The Toyota production line is run with the timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in Britain and the EU, and cars are manufactured from the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it can cause disturbances at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages.
Keeping up for more than 24 hours at Derbyshire factory is impossible according to Toyota, and production should be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is 'a precise calibration to avoid these checks at the border'.
"We need an agreement, and we want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but also an opportunity that we need to use for the good," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"It is not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers' statements show that we must definitely be able to continue the series of very well-functioning supply chains until now."
Tokyo cannot tell us how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and acts as the contractor of the trade union at the factory, says to worry about the growing members: "I feel that lost jobs will never come back.
The government informant says: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may delay again, White House announces
The challenging meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be "to move on even a week", the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh surrounded by a debtor duty, the White House announced on Sunday.
Mr Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who, in turn, examines Russia's involvement in elections, the connections of Trump's assistants to Russia and the President's possible actions to prevent justice.
In Washington, there have been rumors about Trump's intention to separate Deputy Minister of Justice, which would endanger the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times will report to Rosenstein's centres on the possibility of recording secretly discussions with Trump, as well as on the possibility of separating the President from the US Constitution on the basis of Appendix 25.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to have been the resignation of Rosenstein.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations at that time, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "not preferably" resign from Rosenstein, but that meeting was delayed because its time was met with a hearing from the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasay Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's last week's study on Kavanaugh's claims, which continued to delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press chief Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "There's no deadline for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed even more than a week due to everything else, the highest court is currently in progress.
But I always want to keep the press updated."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders did not hold the White House press conference after 10 September.
The newsman Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is because of reasons other than the dissatisfaction of TV suppliers in their "humanity" but said, "I do not deny the fact that they are obsessive."
However, Sanders acknowledged that there would be an increase in direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The President will have more interviews than any president before him," he says, "and add more evidence to the book "We've checked those numbers."
"The press events are still being organised," Sanders said, "but it is far better for the media to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We are often trying to do this and you have seen us do this several times during the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump will answer questions regularly when leaving the White House or participating with valuables visiting open events or press conferences.
The performance alone at the press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown reasons for this when there is an unprovoked and time for strangely gathering journalists.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter on the fears of brexin for workers from the EU's home of Scotland's public health system (NHS Scotland)
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the members of the Scottish health care system from EU countries in order to express their gratitude and wish for them to remain in the country after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter while the United Kingdom's resignation from the EU is less than six months away.
The Scottish Government has already set aside to cover the costs of applications for EU citizens working in specialised public services.
Freeman writes as follows: During the summer divorce negotiations between Great Britain and the EU have continued on the path to the expected decisions.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible non-contractual difference.
I know all these things are uncertain times for you.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our employees to citizenship without looking at it.
Ladies and gentlemen from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie due to emergency injury
The Tennessee State Tigers Supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team was destroyed 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, reports Tennessea supplier Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that there was an injury just before half the time.
"He came to the side of the border, and he simply fell into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the side of the border before they set him up for couples and took him to a later evaluation.
Tennessee State's provider told WSMV channel editor Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been in surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that "no information on the type/digression is available at this stage" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second year student at Tennessee State University and is the first to play in the team after his transfer.
He had five bars on Saturday before he left the game, which makes a total of 18 bars this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp when they buy real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp when they buy real estate in Britain. The extra money will be used to help homeless people according to the new conservative party plans.
The purpose of this amendment is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect up to 120 million pounds a year — to help homeless people
Theresa May will inform you today about the higher level of stamp tax on foreign buyers when they buy real estate in Great Britain.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper dwellings and paid attention to good income taxation.
The increase in the stamp tax will be directed at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to Britain, and the extra money will be channelled into the government's actions to help the homeless.
The additional charge – which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago, in addition to the 2nd apartment and investment housing increases – can be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to 120 million annually.
Approximately 13 per cent of London's new buildings are purchased from non-United Kingdom residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-occupied buyers to have access to the property market.
Many wealthy territories in Britain, especially its capital, have become ‘ape towns’ because several foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will only come weeks after Boris Johnson presented a way to ease the purchase of first-occupied homes for young people.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and leaving it unbuildingd, and asked Prime Minister Mayo to reject low-cost housing quotas to remedy the "serious situation" of the UK housing.
Corby has published a series of outstanding proposals for reforming the housing market, including goat restraints and the termination of "personal decisions".
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I was going to give my Prime Minister's dream last year – that every generation's life should be better than its predecessor – to return.
This means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
It cannot, however, be right that people who do not live in Britain, as well as companies located abroad can buy housing as easily as those who live in Britain.
Too many people have become too distant a dream, and the shame of being homeless remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish country team"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "first goal" is to become a manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about its challenge to raise the country's doggy angle back to its home. The team is currently in the third place in the UK's second division.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he was directed by St Mirren back to Scotland during the last season.
"When I was a kid, I wanted to play with my country's team.
I got into the second team and it was there," Ross says at the BBC: Scotland's Sports Sound.
"As a child I often looked at my father and my father in Scotland's games in Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as a manager of the company."
These include Dick Advocate, David Moyas, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about entering his famous predecessors in nominal company, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"Today, I will measure my own success by the fact that I can restore this company to the electoral time.
Based on the structure and ability of the Society, it is undoubtedly a member of the electoral age," he says.
"It's not easy for me to get in there, but I'm probably gonna think I'm a success if I can get a bullet back to the team's election age."
Ross has worked as a manager for only three years: first as Dumbarton Deputy Director and then for 15 months in the Heat Coach Group.
After this, he helped Allo to rise from the fall of the third series and raised St. Mirren's fall-off season as champions during the next season.
Ross says he's feeling better now than ever in the team of Clyle, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academics.
"I was probably in a real road trip with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to Alloa's leadership.
"I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than I was to be a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a great deal of money, and I got to enjoy some relatively great successes.
But playing hard can be tough.
The player has to figure out a lot of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, such as stress and work pressure, but running the team seems to be a real task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for work, and I feel better in my own body than I ever did in my adult life.
The whole interview will be listened to on Sunday 30 September at the Radio Scotland frequency at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the chair on Saturday at 5.30 p.m., the study shows
The thermal wave of the summer has kicked off British pubs, but at the same time, it's put more pressure on the food chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but the production of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures from Peter Martin's business consultant CGA say: "The continued sunny weather and the more anticipated participation of England in the World Championships in football meant that July made up of pubs like June 2.8% higher, whereas the month was even worse than the month before.
The fall of 1.8% in food sales only deteriorated in July.
The concentrated pubs and bars on the drinking party were the most successful, and their like-for-like sales grew more than the fall in food sales.
The pomegranate pubs also suffer from the heat, but less dramaticly than the restaurants' spinners.
It looks like people just wanted to drink out of their minds.
Sales of pubs and bars run by companies grew by 6.6% over the month, and food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman of the RSM company offering leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services says: "The results continue to develop a trend that has continued since the end of April.
Rules and major social or sporting events are still the main factors affecting the sale of the non-household food market.
It is not a surprise that the fight against food chains continues, although the fall in sales of 4.8% annually is agitated especially now that the sector is struggling with cost pressure.
A long hot summer could not have come to a worse sauna for those who were focused on food, and only time shows whether the lively softer temperatures in the industry were sorely needed to breathe.
The total increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer for sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sectors, which collects and analyses results data in 47 areas of competence from the group with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds.
The fifth of the children's secret social media accounts at their parents
A fifth of children – some of whom are up to 11 years old – to hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, says
A study of 20,000 upper secondary schools revealed the existence of a growing “Instagram Feikkitien” phenomenon
The news raised concerns about the possibility of sharing sexual content on the accounts.
20 per cent of students told me they were holding a ‘main account’ shown to parents
A fifth of children — some of whom are up to 11 years old — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 upper secondary schools revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagrams’, referring to the Instagram website for the distribution of images.
The news has raised fears about the possibility of publishing sexual content on the accounts.
20 per cent of the students told them they kept cleaning up their ‘main accounts’ for parents while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager in which she hoped she would be raped after she ran into her 13 - year - old daughter's secret site.
In a study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the RAC, 40 per cent of young people aged 11-18 held two separate profiles and half of the respondents admitted to hold secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online facilities where parents and teachers cannot find them."
From Eilidh Doyle, the "voting of athletes" to the Scottish Government of athletes
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Government as a non-executive member, taking part in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most awarded athlete in Scotland. Ian Beattie, Chairman of the Board, describes the name as a fine opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience of the athlete over the last decade.
"Eilidhi is being respected with athletes in Scotland, Great Britain and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the government," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I look forward to the role of athletes as a noise storm, and I hope that I can be of benefit and help guide Scottish sport in the right direction."
Four Olympic cults won American athletes who won 200 metres and 400 metres of trips to the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and now acts as a permanent commentator of the BBC lost their walking powers as a result of a transient brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I got a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say it's only time to show, heal, and get better.
This has been an exhausting work, but I have recovered completely, learned how to walk again, and now I'm already working on a chain!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Mothers' ad for cows to share views online
The company that makes breast-feeding pumps breast-feeding mothers is sharing views over the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has placed a product on the market called "the world's first silent and on-board chest pumps".
Four real-life mothers dance in the naves, among other things, the following song says, "Yes, I'll milk it myself, but she doesn't see it" and "if you don't happen to know, they're not tours, but it's tits".
The story goes on: "Put it out, pump it out, feed it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my legs."
However, advertising published on the Facebook page of the company caused a debate online.
77 000 viewers and hundreds of comments have raised conflicting reactions to viewers. Many say it is to ruin the daily “crazy” of the dairy industry.
"The use of loans in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen shortly after giving birth," one commentor writes.

Another viewer commented: "It is clearly tragic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they be used to advertise a chest pump for mothers who can have their baby?"
The third commentator added: "A full-blown advertising of reality."
I also received defenders: a woman admitted that the advertisement was "happy" in her opinion.
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I still sucked.
I felt like a cow when I was a quitter.
It's a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," says one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun advertisement for mothers who are shopping (often at work or in toilets) and "feeling like cows".
The purpose of the advertising is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the commercial, the women of the video show that they've danced unnoticed pumps in their bras when they fell.
The concept of a advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, instead, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and is unobtrusively suitable for suckling vests, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even visit out during the poting.
Ana Balarin, a member and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office, commented: "The Elvie pump is a remodeling product that earned a bold and provocative entry to the market.
We wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump to the bright light by taking the emotions of the incredible freedom brought by the new pump, in a entertaining and identifying way."
Elvie's pump has ended up in the headlines before.
In London’s fashion week, the mother of two children was present in Catwalk by the designer Marta Jakubowski’s residence using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to the tent camp at the Texas border in all silence
However, despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unaltered, the number of displaced migrant children has increased sharply, due to the difficulties in investing children in the families of the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration.
Most foster families have traditionally been made up of non-documented migrants, and registration can endanger their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that possible family members and other members of the economy had to hand out their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, High Level Entry and Customs Authority, last week, proved that the Agency arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster care for minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of arrests did not have a previous criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of people who are either members of the foster families or members of their households are illegally present in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminals of foreigners.
So we keep looking for these people," Albence says.
In order to examine the cases of children more quickly, new rules have been introduced by the authorities that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with by the court within one month of the date of application, rather than the 60-day time limit previously used, the staff of the reception centre.
Many would rather be present through a video conference than in personal proceedings before the courts on the matters of migrants.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be immediately deported.
According to the reports published by the reception centres and the system over the past few months, the time spent in child imprisonment has an impact on whether children are beginning to suffer anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or forced businesses.
According to the lawyers, particular concerns arise in larger establishments, such as Turin, where the child’s despair can be missed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that the transfer of children to tent cities without giving them sufficient time to prepare for it emotionally or to make good-bye friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering traumas.
Syria commands the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moualem, who also acts as a prime minister, said that the foreign troops in the country were illegally involved in the fight against terrorism, using the excuse, and that "they will act with them in accordance with it".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the anti-terrorist war is almost past" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions of people have been forced to escape their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight 'holy' until all Syria has been cleared' from both terrorist organisations and 'scalling from foreign forces'.
The United States has around 2 000 soldiers placed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and the Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested more than 1,000 soldiers in the land of battles.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said that conditions are good for the return and accused some Western countries of spreading 'irrational fears', which encourages refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have called on the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicalizing something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned against the fact that reconstruction aid to Syria is not granted before the end of the war between Assad and opposition by political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer area at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has been prevented by the large-scale attack of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the territory of which three million people live.
Moualem has, however, stressed that the agreement has "a clear time limit" and expressed the wish that military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including al-Qaida-related al-Nusra front fighters, "to be destroyed".
The UN Ambassador, Staffan de Mistura, would soon like to invite the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to the "review of the present Constitution" and warned against confusion.
Why Trump becomes elected for another season
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the elections for 2020 unless, as many Liberals are likely to expect, re-election and scandals to decide early on his presidential term.
This would undoubtedly be the 'dramatic Presidency' decision ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in the viewers.
After 2014, the best watch time figures have doubled with CNN 1,05 million and almost tripled by MSNBC 1.6 million.
Fox News says that Nielsen has 2.4 million viewers at the best time compared to 1.7 million in four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached the cable TV: with a peak of 3.5 million viewers as major news shows.
"This is a rock that attracts people because it is something we don't understand", leading producer of the ABC Designed Survivor program Neal Baer says of the Minister who will rise to president after the attack on the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced a comedy writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneading Into the Hollywood Boys' Club author, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Indeed, contrary to other TV programs, news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade goes to see if members of the immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy can.
Immediateness is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond the obligation of a conscious citizen to look at the six-hour expert panel, claiming the use of Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar strutskin pilot (Washington Post says "inadvantage clothing"), and the consequences of the uncautified representations of Stormy Daniels' anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"What he does feels like a real-tv programme, because it is partly about giving the public something every night," says Wheelhouse Entertainment Director, and Pantilainaamo series creator of Brent Montgomery Trump's show for changing individuals and changing every day the line changes (NFL line, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't miss any episode, or you'll fall off the cart.
When I caught Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a wonderful sunny day on the northern coast of the Faraway, but he couldn't go out because he looked at MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the programme in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of Western civilization," Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

On the outside, you're going to have money for a tight field trip.
It is not surprising that the 17th constituencies of Pennsylvania have encountered a real flow of money, as two candidates who have already been elected to fight in one place because of the restructuring of the congresses.
This newly-created unit in Pittsburgh is a battle challenge for the democratics of Conor Lamb, who became the place of the second round of elections in the last spring special elections.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Keith Rothfus, Republican, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is parallel with the new 17th parliamentary district.
The division of the region was redeployed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old electoral division would favour Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17 parliamentary district has been launched in the financial departments of the main economic parties in the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRTC).
Lamb’s name was well known in Pennsylvania after the 18th Congress round of the 18th Congress round of Pennsylvania special elections.
The place had been Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20%.
Political commentators have made a fine head start for the Democrats.
The United States designed to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but rejected his intention to do so.
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recorded the situation in Beijing and the mild reaction to Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners deported the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to invite American diplomats to return from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "responsible guidelines that no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department journalist in her opinion earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, who received an estimated $ 140 million in help from the United States in 2017, was considered criminal sanctions, including drug control, as well as development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been seriously hit by the Central American State with a high degree of unemployment and mentality.
As internal meetings took place, the authorities of North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity.The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from pursuing the United States.
In mid-September, however, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was to be moved forward and that it effectively decided on speculations for possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pencen is now expected to give some sort of indication of the importance of the government to meet in mid-October, by the diplomats.
These three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic in all silence without any new bad messages or punishments from Washington.
The informant of Bolton's White House refused to comment on the details of the debate with three American officials, with two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report confirmed the external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the protection of the anonymity condition.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawman Robert Mueller on the possible violation of President Trump's law, which now has very strong evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to be conducting an investigation into whether Trump's campaign was secret in cooperation with Russia when Russia was involved in the US elections.
If the power changes in Congress, President Trump will notice that he is accountable to it just in preparation for his return to his voters and that he may be judged by his peer.
There are a lot of whispers here, and I do not mean to say that Mr Trump's loss would be inevitable - as much as the loss of those who have been killed in Europe.
We need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions determine how long this struggle will take.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been ready to run from Hitler’s power if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history will go on to such turning points, where the unsolved progress of democracy will either be accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now faced with a number of such turning points.
What would we do if President Trump fired Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been subject to polish since the public was informed that he had proposed a secret record of the President's speech and considered the possible inability of the President to carry out his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times's report is a mistake.
"How do we react if the newly required FBI investigation into the activities of Brett Kavanugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest witness?
And above all, are we going to vote for a Congressman who considers President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these triales, our democracy will be in the long and dark winter.
But I believe that our success is due to the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, and she was banished by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz that once filled my diplomat bag.
He survived, moved to America as a transferer, and sent me 60 years later to set the Sabbath candles on that table that had been decorated by the hakarist.
How can I have more than an optimistic future with this inheritance?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans as an optimist to encounter Rapid Wien
The Rangers meet at their home on the Thursdays of Rapid Vinnana, knowing that in the same month, after a match against Villarreal in Spain, a victory against the Austrians would give the team a strong position to get to Europe's league G segment.
The knee injury prevented the midfield player Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before Villarreal 2-2 games, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a pop-up board for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer", a 31-year-old player says.
"We went to the game, waiting for us to get something and bring us a point.
Perhaps we could have been able to catch the victory at the end, but overall, the game is probably a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half of time, and we got on the other side, and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game, because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with this team's support, we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough about my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can now weigh full weight, leave the past season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep
Although the participants in the study had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, only a few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in a country-wide study reported that they were discussing the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% of respondents told me that they talked to their children about it.
"The people want family members to take care of them, but they do not take care of them," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you tell them in time.
Talk to the professional people and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor of cost.
Take economic advice into consideration: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance for covering these costs, or self-sufficient insurance if you have a reserve.
Download legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative in place so that you can name the person you trust to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you can't communicate with them.
Consider, too, the drawing up of a proxy for the treatment of your economic activities.
It allows you to determine the person you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid if you cannot take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital for a healthful emergency.

Indonesia is located in the active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia in northern Finland caused a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh area.

Federal prosecutors are considering reducing the rare death penalty to a suspect of the NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty in Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in eight human lives in New York City, a criminal offence that has not been executed in the state since 1953.
According to the charges, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in the attic to hit the West Side Highway bikeway in the south of Manhattan where he drove on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the report on the application for a death penalty in the southern district of New York, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to demonstrate that Saipov killed eight of his victims with a 'foreseeable' effect and caused serious physical injuries.
According to the document of the Court of Justice, it is possible to give rise to a death penalty for both of these accusations.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court made a 22-point charge to Saipov, including eight murders to assist a terrorist organisation, typically the federal prosecutors use this code in cases of organised crime, and there was also a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles;
The attack required "supervised planning and preparation", the prosecutors stated and described the way in which Saipov made his actions "for terrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullavivic Saipov caused injuries, harm and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruchin, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
From the previous time, when the right of the southern administration of New York City has been granted the death penalty, it has been a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes found himself guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but he was eventually convicted of having a life sentence in September 2009.
The last death penalty was implemented in New York in the case of the federal case in 1953, when a married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed on a conspiracy for Soviet stability two years earlier during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any sign of regret during the days and months that followed.
He told scientists that he felt good about what he did, and the police told me.
According to the defendant, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He was charged with a 22-point charge. He was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence attorneys representing Saipov, said the defence was a "naturally disappointed" decision of the prosecutor.
"In our view, the decision to impose the death penalty and not recognition and life-longness without the possibility of being released is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by the parties involved in these events," Patton said.
In the past, Saipov’s defense had asked that he not be required to be punished for death.
The Conservative MP says that NIGEL FAAGE should be held accountable for the Brexit negotiations.
Mr Farage promised today in the protest against conservatives to "mobilize the civil army."
Former President Ukip said that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of the representatives of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives proposed to lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative liner Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out already" if Farage were a brexit secretary.
But May meets the avoidances of his deeply divided line by subduing the challenge of remaining conservatives who joined in a separate protest against brexite in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep Chequers on the surface of his proposal for the promotion of brexite supporters and opponents, as well as the EU's squeeze.
In spite of a setback with Brussels, the aiders have requested him to continue his attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said in the event of Leave Means Leave, Solihull, that he wanted to "get the Chequers proposal".
He proposed that Farage be involved and that this should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: 'I am defending the brexit, but the Chequers proposal must be removed'.
He expressed his response to the EU by saying: "We did not fight the world war in order to become subject to the end of the war.
We want to legislate our own laws in our own country."
Bone was stunned by the idea that the public opinion would have changed after the vote in 2016: "The fact that the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely incorrect claim."
The conservative brexist advocate, Andrea Jenkyns, also took part in the march and said to the editors: "I will only say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party or by the activists who are really going to the streets and are primarily responsible for our success.
Leave the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a letter addressed to May, he added: "The ministers may keep their work while they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians would have to feel pressure if they were to round the decision on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is a matter of trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it."
When speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to run the brexin, they have to feel pressure on your own."
"We are going to mobilise an army of citizens in this country, who gave us victory in the brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is a sovereign, self-government and proud state again."
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before the two-hour opportunity to be held in the city centre.
A small number of activists were sneezing "Tories Against Brexit" signs, and a group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the conservative security problems they had with the party’s application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems fixed and all the technology for Canadian plus arrangement, and unqualified border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a full farce.
There is no good brexite," he added.
Warren is seriously considering the President's term of office.
The US senator Elizabeth Warren says he is seriously considering the presidential mandate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported a masseusets Democrat talking about his future in the city hall in the West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is well known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will meet in November in the latest-class Republican Geoff Diehlin, a joint president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is thought to be on a possible condition against Trump in the 2020 elections.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with the voters after Trump's period began.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to be president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman at the highest place.
Arrest in case of LSU Sims shooting
On Saturday, the Louisiana Baton Rouge police announced that they arrested a person suspected of being shot by the LSU basketball team in the death of Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police reported Dytoon Simpson's 20 arrests at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of a Friday shooting scene and asked for help to identify a man.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a more gunshot wound in his head and died as a result," the police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was present during the interrogations, held a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't do the resistance when he was arrested, and he was taken to East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 in the last season and his mean was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 record balls per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team arrangements offered him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements are an important element in the competition.
Buttas got a good departure from the stake and left Hamilton almost his own luck in defending his place in the first two rounds, calling Vettel on his teammate.
Vettel first left Hamilton with a bunch of tails, which should have been resolved.
Mercedes visited the tour later and returned after Vettel, but after a little contact with Hamilton and the Ferrari driver moved counter-tenderly from the inner line, giving up the defence of his investment after two third translations of his movement.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st birthday, started out of the back row and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was led by a large part of the competition as he prolonged the exchange of tyres in order to end quickly and to take the fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the shadow at the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds when Räikkösen took place in the fourth place.
This was a difficult day because the Valtter performed perfectly throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman when I passed.
The team has done an exceptional job with a double victory," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not release a letter from Christine Blasay Ford, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking in West Virginia, the President did not immediately mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of human 'evidence, vanity and dishonesty'.
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the senate for the last few days, as we see the pain, the people who are angry, the mean, the evil and the dishonest," said the President.
"When we see publications and bedded things and then they say ‘voo, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you guys get this information?
Do you remember his reply... Did you remember the document - ‘Oh, what?
Oh, no.
No, I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Our years we... no, we didn't bleed," he added the senator to drink.
In July Feinstein received a letter describing the charges for Fordin Kavanaugh and the letter was published in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have happened in his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Professor Ford, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein said to the committee after The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban was not acceptable to the President, who commented on it on Saturday's occasion: "I would like to tell you that that was very poor of body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual harassment by three women, and thought the accusations of the Democrats for their own benefit.
"They have decided to get back to power by whatever means.
You see that meanness and confusion, and they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule," Mediaite reports the President.

Patrick Dwyer made Giant two goals against Dundee
Dundee Stars applied for a refund on Friday against Belfast Giant by winning the defeat of Elite League in 5-3 Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had a leading role in the early stages thanks to two goals made by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauullier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home team levels before Dwyer returned Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard set the two goals for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald ensured victory.
This was the third Elite League killing for Adam Keefen's men, who won ddeen 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.

Air traffic controller died to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped the earthquake
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller has become a hero since he died to ensure that hundreds of passengers were safely aired.
More than 800 people have died and many are lost since the attack on the island of Sulawes by a powerful earthquake and its tsunami on Friday.
Powerful extremisms test the area, and several people have been trapped in material that has been damaged Please in the city.
Although the partners fled their lives at the store, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agang did not leave his job in a wildly exhilarating air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed still and made sure that Batik Air's flight to the runway was 6321 safely in the air.
After that, he jumped out of the air traffic control tower he thought was going down.
He died later at the hospital.
The Air Navigation Indonesia informant Yohannes Sirai said that Agang's decision could save hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News News reported.
From the Balikpapan of Kalimantan, a helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news is breaking our heart," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the victim's population will grow to thousands, as the country's disaster authorities have announced links with the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The century is believed to continue to rise because many bodies have buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," the Agency's informant Sutopo Purwo told us.
Even waves that have grown to six metres have been destroyed by Please, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and freight machines bring assistance and equipment to the area.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: #The ambulances are bringing bodies all the time.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
In the CNN interview, Jan Gelfand, Director of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help those who have survived, but we do not know what is waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it can prove even worse."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widododo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces of the country, "I ask you all to work night and night so that all the evacuation tasks can be dealt with.
Are you ready?" CNN news.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people died in earthquakes in Indonesia, Lombardy.
Micronesia flight accident: Air Niugin says one person is lost after the plane crashed into the lagoon.
In the Pacific Ocean, representatives of the airline flying to the lagoon now report that one person is missing, although according to the previous announcement, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from a safe-to-reflecting plane.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident scientists.
The airline did not immediately answer any questions about additional information on the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The reason for this situation and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was driven over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes told me the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jayes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to fold in a sinking plane in water for emergency exits.
He told the passenger crew that they were panicking and screaming, and that he himself had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seamen who participated in the repairs of the nearby port plant by transporting people to the shore on a rubber boat before the plane drowned into a deep water of about 30 metres (thousand foot).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died of traffic accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. concluded a re-treatment that accused a man of burning a mischief woman alive in 2014.
Analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, proved hours as an expert witness in the field of information science.
He described to the jury how he had used the data recorded on his mobile phone when collecting one 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett explained that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis being contrary to previous claims with Chambers on the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis's cell phone was at Chambers' house at the same time as Tellis said he was with Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "she's lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the data recorded on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that, at some point after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The final statements of the defence are planned for launch on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop Trio wants to challenge the generes associated with negative perceptions by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to the British High Breed, the hip hop is different from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the hip hop roots and make the conscious hip hop again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have been able to prove the new rise in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark guy?
New York childcare nurse sues a couple for a racist text message
A New York child nurse challenges a couple's right to discriminate against a child's mother by mistake with a text message, which complains that he's "the same dark guy".
A couple denies being racist and controversies the challenge of writing.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her regret when the new child nurse Giselle Maurice arrived at work on his first working day in 2016 and whiteed that this was dark.
"EIIIII.II.II.II., TAX," Plasco-Flaxman wrote his husband a text message.
But then she sent a message instead of her husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
According to Plasco-Flaxman, after his mistake, he had resigned from Maurice Post, stating that their previous departure passports had been mismanaged by an African-American nanny who had been waiting for the Philippines this time.
Maurice got paid for one of his working days and was sent home by a taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for divorce and wants to make up $350 a day for six months, for which she had originally been cleaned up to live and work in the family, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post magazine on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to racist arguments, saying that the conclusion of Maurice's employment relationship was a legitimate solution because they could not trust him after they hurt him.
"My wife sent him something she wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told me at the Post interview.
"But would you leave your child to the sight of someone you've been unfriendly to, even if accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco was parallel to the challenge of blackmail and I said that his wife had received a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Do you want to start chasing the other guy in a situation like this?
It's not very comfortable," the investment bank added.
Although the trial is still under way, public opinion has quickly condemned the social media of the couple, including their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the public would not identify a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born a little while after the book was approved, says from the letter: “It’s hard to live up to a person who first read the book before the publication.
It's amusing now that the huge popularity of Paddington is known."
To prove that his father, who had worked as a cameraman of the BBC before his dedication to writing child books about toys adventures, would have been optimistic in rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books seemed bitter, since his father died the previous year.
He said his father was silently proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a glamorous guy at all," she says.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you're proud of, even though it's not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave him the credit."
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter was thanked for landing a plane in the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"Nad played a little bit important and told me the situation was really bad that his expected survival was not," Ednan-Laperous says.
Then they called and said my daughter's gonna die in a couple of minutes, and I'm gonna have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The medications used by doctors to keep her heart running gradually removed from her body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now it all went off.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was over.
I couldn't yell or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who died of her daughter, rose to the plane among other passengers who did not know anything about the trials she was currently going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down, and the tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt tremendous compassion for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much she loved my daughter."
Bad women send cards to stop suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones are working to prevent other people from suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can be supported.
Davis' son, Tyler, got depressed when he was 13 years old and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I would not like any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis living in Lydney, 45, tells me that his son was a promising cook with an infectious virtuosity.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would shine all over the room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt "murder".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother, who had torn his life away.
Davis says he's always afraid of after-effects.
Davis created cards "to tell people that there are people who can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet. You have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of being together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas we discovered a change in his conduct.
He was all over the country on Christmas Day, when the children opened up their gifts, he didn't take any eye contact or anything like it.
He says Mark's death was a difficult trauma to them, but they still have to make it through: "It breaks down the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But all we have to do is go on living and fight ahead."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts his investigation.
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - in time and in scope - we could perhaps achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "discriminate" the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican contributions want an FBI investigation?
Opposition is about timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, 6 November, and if the success of the Republicans is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the senators to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What happens after the FBI report is drawn up?
The Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democracies are currently sitting, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice President Mike Pence could blow through the game and strengthen his choice to the highest court.
The number of North Korean parasites falling during Kim
According to the Korean legislator, South Korea's number of people in North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
Park Byeong-segug quoted the South Korea’s Ministry of Harmonisation and told us that the cuts took place last year in 127 C.E.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in prices for road hauliers.
There is no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korea's lobbyists are finally offered South Korea's citizenship.
It is stated from Seoul that more than 30,000 North Koreans have entered the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a heavily protected demiliated zone between the Cores.
China treats parasites as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often return them violently.
Still technically, relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the ongoing negotiations on the nuclear war.
This followed a June historic meeting in which US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed at a general level on the effort towards the Korean peninsula's nuclear integrity.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho missed the United States' seats after the meeting.
"With no confidence in our national security from the United States, we have no reliable basis and under such circumstances, in any case, we will not unilaterally break out our equipment first", Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosis calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the highest court
A minority leader, Nancy Pelos, called the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that this would be temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
You were afraid to comment on this at your Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called "hysterical", "the fear of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's witness statement before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied the accusations that he would have sexually molested Christine Blasay Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the power of his feelings and, between his emotions, he nearly cried and lost his speech when he told his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the members of the committee without calling themselves "grotesk and planned persecution against the person", organised by the Liberals who were mad at the presidential destruction of Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Your fear said that Kavanaugh’s statement of witness shows that this is not capable of acting in the highest court because it showed that he is partial to the Democrats.
"I believe that he made himself inadequate in his statements and in the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
You were afraid to wonder if he was asked to press charges against Kavanaugh if this choice would be confirmed and if the Democrats had received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is currently working", Pelos replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the U.S. federal court of appeal.
As a Democrat, he was concerned by the possible provisions of Kavanaugh on health reform or Roe v Wade, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative courtman.
In its confirmatory consultations, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical and objective person to be elected a member of the court and we would expect to know that it is amazing," Pelosi said.
Women have to figure it out.
This is a legitimate fire speech in the period of months and years of rage, and he cannot keep it without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly assisted by a woman who was in a position to lead and who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to tell her speech partner in a situation where she was angry and started crying, "You think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really mad."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The tears receive justification as a route of desolation, although they are generally considered to be fundamentally wrong.
One of my most fascinating memories of my early job in the male-powered office is when I once cried without words about rage and older women - a cold-hearted supervisor, whom I had always been a little afraid of - took me from my neck and pulled me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy because they got sorry for your mind."
Patricia Schroeder, the Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart got caught in 1987 with a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, the very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he would not try to be president himself.
"It was not a very thought-out decision," he said to me, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were seven of them, and one more was needed at least.
Someone called the situation "The Snows and the Seven Crows."
Since the campaign period was long enough, he was behind the fundraiser, and so he said he wouldn't go to the race if he didn't get a total of $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
He was told that some of his supporters, who gave him a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
"Does they think I'm getting something for a discount?" she thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he became in the power of his feelings towards his supporters of gratitude, the frustration system, which made it so difficult to collect funds for election work against voters and delegations, and hate for sexists, that he could not speak.
"You could have thought I was getting a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls press reactions.
"You could have thought Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would probably be beaten as a memorial.
"He cried."
How the US and China’s trade war can benefit Beijing
The launch of the U.S. and China's trade war was earful and, although the battle is nothing but a passing, countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import duties on the most important export articles in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most significant deterioration occurred with new duties affecting import goods for USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion) and effectively taxing half of all imports from the PRC to the United States.
Beijing has responded to the same rate every time, last time by imposing customs duties on US import goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world is becoming more sensitive for a moment.
To allow Washington to retreat, we should give in to our own demands, but it would be far too humble for President Xi Jinping of China to bow down to the public in the United States.
However, experts note that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-state dependence.
"A short political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, can create conditions that start in one of the countries of the economic shock cycle, and this is in fact more dangerous than bystanders have so far understood", says Abigail Grace, a research assistant in Asia at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the country is "ready" for the return of refugees
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to seek help to rebuild the country after a devastating war of over seven years.
When speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country would improve.
"Your position is now more stable and safer due to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore their normal situation.
The conditions now allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of the unilateral economic activities of terrorism and their daily lives and income.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful for its assistance in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported rebels.
The European team confirmed the victory of Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in the finals of the U.S. team against 16.5 in 10,5 Le Golf Nationals outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe, which has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player, had trouble almost throughout the tournament, and he hit his launch in the water on the 16th route of par-3-radan, giving Francesco Molinar a match.
The Italian Molinari played all the rounds and became one of the four players that have won 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth came out with the result of 5&4 against the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Denmark’s Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, lost income for 2 and 1 England Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European tournament in all time with 25,5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
The year has been heavy.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win this victory.
It is about the team and I am glad that I may have helped," said the moved Garcia, after winning the European team.
He's moving the ring to his countryman, Jon Rahmi, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 at the individual competitions he played on Sunday.
"I knew a huge pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up to admire him," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now he has a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and will remain second only for Jack Nickla.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, the U.S. team had trouble finding routes throughout the weekend, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
The U.S. team, Captain Jim Furyk, said that after the failed show, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team into the games this morning.
We've put in a fight.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to raise my hat.
We met our winners."
