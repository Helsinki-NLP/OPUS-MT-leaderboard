I'm resting.
I remember both of you.
I remember that, too.
I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I remembered him for his duty.
I respect Tomi.
I'll retire in four years.
I put my ass at risk for you.
First get these shirts out.
I'll run faster than you.
I run eight kilometers a day.
I'm running.
I won the horses, sir.
That's what I said, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wouldn't work.
I said no.
I said thank you.
I sat there staring.
I was sitting next to him.
I was sitting down thinking.
I was sitting down thinking.
I was sitting next to the driver.
The tomato fruit or vegetables?
I was sitting on the floor.
I saw a bear driving a truck.
I saw a bear go with a truck.
Last weekend, I saw a very good movie.
I saw Dana.
I saw him a week ago.
I saw it.
I saw John in the library.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
I saw one.
I saw something.
I saw it.
I saw the car explode.
I saw them.
I saw Tomi dancing with another girl.
I saw Thomas today.
I saw your name on the list.
I washed the sink.
I was secretly hoping this would happen.
I've been photographing it.
I secretly photographed him.
I see a house.
I see a lion.
I see a noble man and a noble lady.
I rarely see him.
I see that.
I see what you're thinking.
I was sympathizing danger.
I sent you flowers.
I served with Tom at the Special Forces.
I set the table for six people.
I've set it up for six.
Is everybody okay?
Is everybody here?
Does everyone talk about me? — No, Tomi. You're not that important.
It's all right in the office.
Is everything ready?
Is fast food really healthless?
Is French harder than English?
Is it hard for French to say?
Do you teach French in your school?
Your tongue is French?
Youtube's a crime?
Is he sick or is he a doctor?
American?
It's crying?
Is he my friend?
He's tall?
I was shaking hands with Tom, and I went.
I'm shaking my head.
I should go there.
I should have asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been more focused.
I should have been much more precise.
I should have been much more thorough.
I should have been there sooner.
I should have brought more food.
I should have come here first.
I should have done that last week.
I should have done this somewhere else.
I should have done that with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I never should have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have denied doing that.
I should have seen this come.
I should've stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should've been counting on this.
I should have followed your advice.
I should have said I was busy.
I'm screaming, but no one can hear me.
I just want to know what's going on.
Is this a bird?
Is it okay if I call you Tom?
Is that a wolf?
Is it cold in Germany?
Is that dangerous?
Is it easy to learn to speak as an expert?
Is it fatal?
Is it gonna rain tomorrow?
Is it hard to speak English?
Is that mandatory?
Is that normal?
Do you mind if I sit down here?
Prek?
Is this too late?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Is it true Tom killed himself?
Is it true that in a week you've learned as an expert?
Is it true you got me on Tom's proposal?
Is it true you like salt coffee?
Is it light?
The fruit juice is more affordable than coffee?
In winter skis, I swim in summer.
Laurie dundi?
I'm sleeping with two pillows.
After midnight, I slept last night for an hour.
I fell asleep, I was late for school.
I slept for nine hours.
Thanks to my boss.
I sliced her turkey.
Mary Tom's mother?
I'm smoking cigarettes.
Is Monday gonna be good?
Am I clear?
I've been clicking on a picture.
I snuck into the house.
I ran into the house.
I blew it.
Is it okay now?
Was it not enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't it a stomach sprayer?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I feel sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Is Paris far?
I'll speak a little Dutch.
I'll speak a little in Hungarian.
I speak a little in Hungarian.
I speak a little in Hungarian.
I'll talk a little Russian.
I'll speak a little Russian.
I'm a little Russian.
I speak French almost every day.
I speak French and English.
I'm talking to Spanish.
I've been with him all day.
I've been at them all day.
I spent all my money.
I spent all my money.
I spent all the money I had to buy the book.
I've been bobling for an hour until I found out where to go.
I spent in an incubator stage of my life.
I spent in an incubator stage of my life.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I spent the whole day banging in front of my plane.
I've been sitting three years for a crime I didn't commit.
I've sat down three years for something I didn't do.
I told you too early.
They're gonna get Citrus-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O.
Is the rain water hot?
Russia is part of Europe or Asia?
Is he so important?
Is she your mom?
Is it really close to Sicilian Malta?
I've been staring at papers all day, and now I'm tired.
I began to doubt his claim in truth.
I stayed.
Tea is more expensive than milk?
Is he authorized?
That's all the change?
Secret?
Is that right?
Is that deliberate?
Is that a bet in the picture or is it photographed there?
Is that what you're wearing?
Is this my mug?
Is that a public document?
Is that a problem for you?
Is this real money?
Do you have any scientific grounds for this?
Did you expect something like that?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is that the problem?
Right?
But is that true?
Is that what everyone wants?
Is the cat on the chair or under it?
Is the beach clean?
Is the competition that bad?
Is the microphone on?
Is the museum open today?
Do you have a doctor on board?
Is there a place to go?
Is there a subway in your town?
Is there an elevator here?
Is there any doubt?
Any more of this?
Is there anything between you two?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Do I have to do something?
You want to tell me something, Tom?
Is it?
Do you have a seat?
Is there a life before death?
Is there something you're more interested in?
Is Iran in uranium?
Is the snake alive or dead?
Is this the baby a little boy or a girl?
Is that cool?
Is that ethical?
Is that a fake?
Is this fish still alive?
Is this for sale?
Is this for sale?
Is that it?
Is this my place or yours?
Is this really alcohol-free beer?
Is that really Jankovics Thomas' quote?
Do you mind if I have this seat?
Is that the phrase correct?
Is that such an insatiable joke?
Is this something you want to be a little bit of a joke?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is that the key you're looking for?
Is that valuable?
Do you love this home?
Is that what you call love home?
Is he your girlfriend?
Is this your money?
I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years ago, exactly where?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time for fun.
There's one or two more things to put in the suitcase.
I have to have breakfast.
I still think it's the best choice.
Tom's Christian?
Tom cooks well?
Tom's a good cook?
Tom's a good teacher?
Tomi's alive?
— Tom American? — No, Canadians.
Tomi's coming over this afternoon?
Tom's dead?
Is Tom in?
Thomas is left-handed?
Tom's lost?
Tom Mary's son?
Is Tom ready?
Is she still sick?
I was standing right there.
I came to you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I study about two hours every day.
At school, I study hard.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you've already packed up and ready to go.
I must have heard that voice somewhere.
I swear I'll make up for it.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Do you feel any better for your daughter?
Are you doing dangerous work?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over it.
I'll take his place.
I go on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
It must be better with your sister.
It comes with love that I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Two euros is the price.
It could be a problem.
It could be sweet.
It would be a shame to see all this work wasted.
He's obviously a freak.
He didn't break.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow didn't stop.
She'll let you come.
He's not doing anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they've been pouring it on me.
I slowly realized I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the other day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.
That's what happened on the day of our marriage, honey.
There had to be some reason for this.
It suddenly happened.
That's what happened when he was outside.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
He's got his own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should be dieting.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think there's been some movies out there.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think we have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's right.
It's a very small probability, I think you're going to be able to do that from yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think that's right.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor may have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I don't think something's right.
I'll find the spiders for the cute ones.
I think he's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget this.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was there already.
I think Tomi's agitating.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom's probably hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Thomas wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's gonna be able to help.
I think Thomas wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all just a bunch of people.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know the name of Thomas' girlfriend.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I suppose you'd like it.
I think you got it wrong.
I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you're doing a very good job.
I think you smell nice.
I don't think you're very convincing.
I think you were right.
I was thinking of Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat, it'd cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with her.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe it was worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've considered my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought it was you.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
That hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under her influence.
It had a very big effect on me.
It's an accident!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put it in practice.
It's hard for everyone to be in the mood.
It's hard for everyone.
I have doubts as to whether this will work.
It's getting very late.
She's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's about time you start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
Wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's just too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector can't be turned off.
It's not the best solution.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It doesn't fit to speak with a full mouth.
It's snowing.
Still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
That's fucking expensive.
Thirty meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
It's useful information.
There's a lot of heat at night.
It's very important to wash your hands thoroughly after you swapped out the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
You'll be ready when you need it.
He'll be ready by the time we have to.
It'll take some time to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be knocking off soon enough.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't have to be here.
You could use a shaving.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
This could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This can save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
I might be late.
You have to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
We need to fix it.
He never existed.
You never should have happened.
I lied to her even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question too.
I've bathed for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I went on the 58th route.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I completely forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper anywhere else.
The rain broke yesterday morning.
It fell yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I work two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I've gone through and through the United States.
It actually works.
It's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I was trying to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life.
I'm trying to keep myself informed.
I'm trying to get my mind together.
That's a nice flag.
Big cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A gray stone building.
It's a housekeeper.
It's 30 minutes till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's all dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's over.
It's nice and good theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's seven o'clock now.
It's already in progress.
It's 10:00 p.m.
One of my dreams was always living next to a stream.
It's always the same string.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's a nasty business, Watson, a dirty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big van.
It's a nightmare.
It's freezing.
It's as much art as science.
It's already in the past.
She's at school.
Very dangerous sports, where a slight mistake can lead to serious injuries.
It's an old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
This is a tidy day.
It's a tough day.
That's what happened earlier.
It wasn't just any week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's better to hang the garden at night.
Firestorm.
Oh, my God.
It's cheaper to get on a bus.
That's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
It's Sunday.
It's Sunday closed.
It's cold in here.
I'm cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
He knew the bear loved honey.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
All right now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's delicious!
It's done!
It's no easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave far away.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
The bus seemed to have been delayed.
That sounds ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It's very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
Looks like you're honest to me.
Looks like you're wrong to me.
Looks like we're gonna have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to miss a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Dear.
It's fair if you get the same pay for the same job.
Not nearly perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
It's getting crazy.
It's starting to become a commotion.
We're going to have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
Lucky to see a dead star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good to learn.
I'm so glad you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to draw that conclusion.
It's hard to believe this whole time was clean and sunny.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town where you can sleep.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to express it with words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's very nice.
He's got an incredibly big head.
He's tall.
The kids are already in bed.
Stop it with the payout.
Tonight it's warmer than usual.
It's illegal.
That's important.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when the child is raised.
It's important that we help them get into trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
This is inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just to get out of here.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
Today's laundry.
It's like an underwater field, and turtles, cancers and sharks over him like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how you live.
It's too cold for swimming.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
That's my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's just too late to be what you could have been.
None of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
He's not as watchy as he sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This won't happen.
You're not going to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It can't be negosized.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth snoring about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
It doesn't make sense to confess to the priest if you don't testify.
There's no point in takin' the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
Obviously impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It doesn't matter if some people think you're a farmer.
It's okay if you're gay.
“ Three months have passed, and Tomi has already said that he speaks French in a liquid way. ” And so, he is at the top of the stupid spirit. — What peak? — Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's only three days.
The park's on the other side.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It looks like I'm pouring tea.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
Pretty convincing.
It's quite simple.
It is quite obvious that these mizantropic theories have been identified in the study of the working class, to rescue imperialism from the responsibility of the blood wars he has cast on, and to perpetuate the core of the thought that man's aggressive tendencies to endless wars are the causes of man's being born with them.
It's urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big deal.
That's where it is.
It's an unscrupulous thing to ask someone how much he's looking for.
They say Czech girls are nice.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
Boston is snowing now.
It's so good to stay home.
Still moving.
It's suicide.
That's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time to take our tent tree.
It's time we get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to solve the problem.
I should get my hair cut off by now.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's about time we did something about this.
Tom has his birthday today.
That's Tom's call.
Tomi's voice is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
That's expensive to me.
It's too hot for this now.
Too late for grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's a typical fall time.
It sucks to have a cold.
It's ugly, dirty yellow, and it doesn't harmonise anything, but at least they don't smoke in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
It's unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you to go or not.
Very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
Very disturbing.
Very amusing.
It takes a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
It's your only chance.
About 10,000 hours of learning is needed for a thorough learning of a language.
You have to be bold to succeed.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took almost three years to build my house.
He's got everyone's attention.
He took an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from the cold.
Tom took a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but eventually it was found.
I turned into a little alley.
I've got a picture.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was a good party.
It was a night early in the night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really great food.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was so weird.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
He was a loser.
It was definitely very enjoyable.
We had a good time yesterday.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and it was a couple of hours.
It was just a road trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.

Then I was home.
