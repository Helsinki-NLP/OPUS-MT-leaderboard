The victory of the right populists in Austria has 29 percent.
The marked weakening of the two parties to the grand coalition so far and the significant strengthening of the right populist parties, according to the first preliminary results, of the pre-arranged elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, has suffered particular severe loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Federation for Austria's Future (BZÖ), Karintia's Province Secretary, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
On the basis of the preliminary results, the country's strongest party remains the Socialist Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of votes, but it lost 5.5% of votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
Even worse, the ÖVP, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results achieved so far in the history of both major parties after the war in Austria, and the result is literally disastrous for the People's Party, which has led to the pre-arranged elections.
At the beginning of July, when leaving the ÖVP coalition, the population party had a significant advantage before SPÖ according to the opinion polls.
However, the electors were apparently punished for letting the government fail.
During the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been expressed about the possible withdrawal of Wilhelm Molterer's party president and the current governor.
The observers believe that this may take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Conference.
This development is likely to facilitate the increasing likelihood of a return to the election results, i.e. the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right populist parties, the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously obtained 18% of the votes and 14 percent of the votes - but the Socialists have also expressed their fears about the recurrence of the 1999 year when the people were united with the populists (the FPO was still united at the time, the BZÖ left in 2005), which has even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume he can return to Vienna in national policy, is obviously the solution.
The Greens Party has arrived in Parliament, which, however, has lost some popularity, and the Austrian political parties have fallen from third place to fifth place.
None of the other parties exceeded the 4% limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: The Indian Relations
If it is not possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists who have been reported for illegal bug collection, according to the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cold in Czech-India relations.
This was published by the Minister in New York after his meeting with Pranaab Mukherds, an Indian partner today.
“If this did not work out, yes, there would be some fright, ” he stated after the meeting, which was inspired by the Czech Republic.
After the trial in Mukherd, Mukherdji told me that the executive power in court cases might be difficult to intervene.
However, he mentioned that, in the case of Petr Švácha, adjudicated and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local management of Dajeelgi, whose legislation belongs to the case.
“His problem could be solved, ” the minister said.
However, according to Mukherdji, he sentenced Emil Kučera to three years in prison, it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
Then he could apply for bail and wait for a verdict, explain.
Schwarzenberg has demonstrated that his partner has expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
“He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to rescue him, ” said the Czech Head of Diplomacy.
The only way to deal with the whole matter is by providing the Czech party, the convicted “competent” legal aid, mentioned by the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party had already given them such help.
“Our main interest is to maintain the best relations with India with many annual traditions.
This is recognised by Indians, said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to the CNK, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic is a major factor in the problem of Czech entomologists.
“ We find it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists, ” he said.
The question of whether or not the Indian party has promised to deal with the matter is that the minister has missed the answer.
“I have received relatively many promises, ” he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
Entering the wall electronic map showing Australia and neighbouring sea areas.
He doesn't care about the continent, but he's an excellent point in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and along with the neighbouring seabed.
In the area, as much as the continent itself, says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer, who belongs to a team of thirty members of the UN Division’s working group on oceans and maritime justice.
His boss, Czech lawyer, director of the division, Václav Mikulka, is monitoring the explanation, which is sometimes complemented.
It's the spirit of labor and enthusiasm that prevails here.
The seabed is a rich, barely known world in natural resources.
Oil and other minerals may be found here, but other living organisms that have not yet been known, for example, could be the key to developing anti-cancer medicines.
Sea bed greater than dry land
Today, coastal states are intensively applying for new sub-sea areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, their rights have been exercised, which was agreed in Jamaica in Montego Bay in 1982.
This is primarily the area of the so-called continental site, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the coasts of the country.
Such a country has the exclusive right to all sources of the continental site under the Convention.
“We have simplified the continental floor and the bottom layer of the bottom of the seabed, which is the natural continuation of the underground part of the sea.
The coastal sea borders, often 200 miles [200 sea miles] far beyond the borders of the exclusive economic zone, explains Mikulka.
The application to be submitted by that country to the Commission which has designated the external borders of the Continental Council should be supplemented by a wide range of scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
\"Our task is legal and professional assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has so far discussed five requests for Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three countries mentioned above have succeeded,\" Mikulka adds.
In the world, Australia's success has recently come to an end, the first of which has substantially expanded its sub-sea country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of the seabed for the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times larger in the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits resulting from future use of the seabed will, they hope, be inestimable.
Other countries continue to submit applications.
The ‘Montego Bay Convention’ may do so within ten years of its ratification.
Where the continental site ends, the Convention begins with the area of the ocean bed declared “the common heritage of man. ”
There is no single country here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
“The seabed, however, is not Klondike, ” says Director Mikulka, “that some of her areas have been legally defined and their regime has been established in a contract.
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the bottoms are now part of the Czech Republic's.
This former Eastern bloc shares with other countries within the framework of the Joint Interoceanmetal Organisation.
In 1991, as with investors from some other countries, this organisation received the status of the so-called 'passenger investor'.
It has the right to produce in the area of ClarionClipperton lying between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by an investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
It's about a copy of the Tatra beneath the sea.
‘This can be produced in a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The rich destination of polymetal coins containing nickel, radish, cobalt and mangan,\" says another lawyer named Hind Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a conductor of the division Macedón, sets another example of the convent.

German special forces present at the hostage release
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage crisis - the professionals came.
When the situation became a joke, the special units were ready, but no action was taken.
The liberalisation of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt is becoming more and more detailed.
In the rescue operation, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Home Affairs reportedly involved German special forces.
In addition to German Federal Army experts, GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Force and the Federal Criminal Office were also experts in logistics at the site of release.
According to the information of the Ministry spokespersons on Monday night, however, the German forces were not necessary because the hostages were allowed to run their prisoners and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as an on-site support force.
“There was no luck, ” said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Home Affairs.
The attackers kidnapped eight tourist groups of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian women, and eight Egyptian escorts in the south of Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of South Egypt, the hostages were beamed down to the border area of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unexplainable until now, as well as details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the refugees arrived safely to Cairo.
Steinmeier reported that the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information about when they would return to Germany.
According to the “Bild, ” daily, five tourists and special forces arrive on the German Airbus Airbus plane to Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. Congressman's rejecting the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress has failed the rescue package of $700 billion proposed for the financial markets by a small majority.
The Dow Jones fell in the deep.
The US Assembly rejected the rescue package of the government in favour of the money markets with 227 votes in favour.
Despite the calls made by President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the programme that they wanted to stop chaos in the money markets did not receive most of it.
The supporters desperately tried to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, a spokesperson of the Democratic Party has called on Members to support, even if the plan is very unpopular.
“It is clear that it has not yet taken place to obtain political support in order to avoid anything that has yet to happen.
Dow Jones fell by more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, to fall again after the failure to make it public.
Experts account for further serious instability in international money markets.
To enter into force, both the House and the Senate should be approved.
The directors register more and more bookings.
It's a good winter for German travel operators.
According to a study, the turnover of bookings for the following months has increased significantly over the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the Germans’ travel mood was not reduced according to the study.
In the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year's period - presented on Monday in Berlin by the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to an examination by the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations in autumn is already higher.
October’s turnover in travel agencies was 11 per cent higher than in October 2007 and reported by the DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agents and then extrapolates the entire market.
The Institute took account of the trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the USA in particular has been reported by the DRV.
Here the volume of reservations has risen round by one third.
The Germans also have particularly popular destinations in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
Mostly the organized roads were sought - said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
As a result of rising energy and food costs, organised roads are cost-effective for passengers rather than for individually organised journeys.
Passengers can save money with reservation discounts or all inclusive offers - Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so there will be another increase in traffic compared to the previous year - although according to another study, less German tourists have undertaken a trip compared to the previous year.
First Oktoberfest
Without a stop, replaying ballermann hits, literish pints of beer and fashioned dirndli famouss.
Debriefing Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't like each other much.
She's wearing blonde, TV leader, and a customized dresser.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my dress in the fur.
One thing is connected to us: We've been with Wiesnen for less than three minutes, we're already runnin' by photographers and filling their memory cards - very flattering, and all of this on my first visit to Wiesnen.
So we can make friends.
Well, it looks like cheap dirndli is up to its destination.
As a Wiesn tourist from the white sausage to the north, my comfort landscape is still bordering on the folk spirit.
But coming to Theresienwies, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears radish or leather pants; no one looks pompous or awkward - everything is fine.
Strange lookouts at the chocolate banana stand are just my rallies.
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the wrong conclusion: “You are free, you are a virgin in the middle, you are on the right, and you are widowed in the back.
Secretly, I put the manni on the left from the back to the left.
“ That’s good, ” he says, “and laughs.
Others strike less blows around fine flirting techniques and carry a simple filter card “I’m too drunk to dress up ” with a sign and show their naked backs.
It's called Bob, a young man who has exhibitionist traits, and he also visited Oktoberfest in the first instance.
What you find very fantastic is long stretching away the \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
He tells me all this after he got rid of the contents of his previous corso.
Right next to one of the fire squads that everyone thinks are garbage bags.
Bob, therefore, is one of the famous “indiscriminates ”
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock this evening, the ambulances are going through the scene and taking care of poor couples.
Patient care providers always appear to be on the team, carrying four of them from the tent to the tent with a covered barrel.
This works like most of the Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure hidden.
Who's lying in the alcohol bowl underneath the poncho, it doesn't look like it.
“These who are completely ready, ” cried out to me, one of the sanettes for my question, and then in the set.
The police named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who got hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The resident of Brentwood, Chelmsford Road, and Carole Paulson, had an accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road, in the city.
They sent him to the hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for reckless driving.
He's been released for bail since then.
Turkey's diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey's intention to join the European Union, European powers have burned from the desire to enter the Turkish countries deeply.
On the eastern side of Bosnia, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, one of the greatest relics of failed imperialism.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neorenescist style.
At least it's what travel books write.
The building surrounds the end of the perons, with a tower at the front corner of each one, and it looks like some German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's getting a little rough.
However, in view of the inside of the bookstore, it is clear that the large-scale enterprise had the most warmest gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, the future of the conquests, through Damascus, intended to implement its ambitions to the reservation of the Middle East through the railway that led to today's Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
The railway lines were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and the coasts of Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station didn't get any better.
In 1917, an ammo train exploded and destroyed the building's well-developed top.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage action.
It's been a long time since, and history's been over.
At the same time today, as the gate to the Anastasia and the entire eastern region, at least in a symbolic sense, serves as a diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Government Party of Justice and Development - ACP - has developed a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment metal.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government is working with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I went to the Turkish capital, the night train to Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts in the ACP, the Turkish Parliamentary representative, Suat Kinikoglut.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the dwindling, which at the time gave me the famous documentary about the old world, I also arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is meant to be a symbol of the new world state, which turns my back on the past.
However, AKP represents a paradox change in the Turkish consensus with known Islamic roots.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP Cathedral, an ultra-modern, stone and steel, specifically in a building designed for this purpose, which is located in a developing suburb, between semi-prepared shopping malls and coffee houses.
Suat Kinikooglu would have included a better-publiced politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, tie, and I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
\"The Party's foreign policy objective is to assist Turkey in its immediate integration.
The Cold War blew up the order, he said.
Turkey is isolated from its country of origin.
Today, he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't have picked one of the two.
He had to open both directions.
“But it is possible that he may have been forced to vote sooner or later, ” I asked.
“Törkország never wanted to get in front of the road, ” he said.
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here, almost mechanically repeated: Turkey, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea, serves Europe and the United States as a benefit to Turkey itself.
It is as if they wanted to send a message that, in the sense that, together with Turkey, Europe as a whole can get to Asia and the Middle East on those routes to the east.
When I was at the Hyderpasha Station again, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who went through this beautiful building 100 years ago.
That they would have wondered if they knew that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited for the ferry at the port to take me back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was called “a sick man in Europe. ”
At the time, at least there was no question as to which continent would please this exciting country.
Remembering Ways: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as director of Guildford's music, Vernon-Tod-Handley led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
Based on her musical plans for the part of the city, she founded her wonderful youth choir Proteus the following year.
In principle, only under 21 years of age could have belonged to the song box, but when Proteus in 1979 was singing its finale - many of us have been at the end of our 20s - we were simply not willing to join the choir.
The Proteus name (the mythological changer name) was consistent with the determination and ability of the choir to cope with any set of bags placed in front of the Madrid or a Messiah; without escort or with a large orchestral escort.
The diversity of the music of such a young choir was often amazing and always exciting, and thanks to the man whose inspiration for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Todd tell us that “let the music speak itself ”
He always said: “The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it.
The conductor's technique was always fully understandable and accurate, but never a indicator or overdosing.
Whatever the music standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If he ever lived as a driver who was supposed to be hit by a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted with the two decades during which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
In the past forty years, I wrote criticisms of over 100 concerts, but never, ever disappointed and often exposed them.
In Tod Handley, the greatness and the modesty were together, which is very rare.
He hated the conductors who, living with his words, simply “with some well-known battles all over the world ”
A lot of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your William Woodruff (September 25th of September) “He continued his economic history studies in Oxford and in 1950 he was awarded a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was constantly preparing for a basic degree, a master’s degree and a PhD title.
It comes from the written notes of Woodruff’s work “Beyond Nab End, ” but it is wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he finished his PhD discussion of the British rubber industry, which was then released in 1958 under Professor J. D. Chambers' leadership at Nottingham University.
In 1950-51, he was indeed in the US with a Houblon-Norman scholarship and in the summer of 1952 at the Illinois, New York and Harvard universities.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
There's no way to know why Woodruff was decorating his career.
J. Vicente Resino on the Philosopher
I recommend the exhibition \"J. Vicente Resino-Flamenco and Life-\" because of the impressive photos of black and white documentary style.
Their respect for simplicity and strength, as well as for the people in the photographs, was drawn to my attention.
It's an exhibition that emotions can pass.
Resino understands the record of magic moments –
Second time sales record at Honda's
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation Jazz.
It is true that your predecessor had already been quite large on the road, but the design of the internal area of the new model was even wider.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolulation versus relaxation.
That's how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although it is very similar to its predecessor in the sight of the new Jazz, many internal changes have been made to it.
These include innovative design, new arms series, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before moving to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz has appeared six years after its first generation has been put on the market.
So first, we can note that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other producers.
In Europe, Jazz is also less known, but on other markets sales records are a finalist.
A market like this, for example, Japan, where in 2002, and then this year, Jazz was the most wanted car brand.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million were sold from Jazz since they got on the market.
The second market was Old Kontinens, with nearly a half a million examples of sales over six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In 2007, while the Japanese company made a total of 83,000 Jazz markets, the sales of 100 000 cars by 2009 will be targeted, leading to an increase of 17% on the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz, which accounts for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary will calculate by way of an example sold during the course of one year.
In fact, just the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda's traffic in Spain.
The company's representatives are predicting 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, with 4000 fewer than the 2007 figures, i.e. a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased by 1.8% compared to last year.
By 2010, I would also like to increase this rate to 2%.
Honda hopes it can be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five - door and compact - 4370 - long hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 20,000 pieces each year in world relations.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's market distribution would be carried out by the United States while the remaining proportion was divided between Old Kontinens and Japan.
The commercial introduction of Insight after the official presentation scheduled for January will take place in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz became wider in all respects.
The length reaches 3900 mm (longer than 5 cents), has increased by 1690 mm (by two cents) and has increased by 5 cents (i.e. 2500 mm).
Height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has become wider.
The larger internal space is guaranteed by the new armour and the central fuel tank - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the - so-called double floor trunk has grown to a full charge of 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres, exceeding the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the type with engines 1.4, since Honda Jazz's trunk of 1,2 is 379 litres.
Some external modifications may also be found, such as rear-end lamps or optional panoramic glass panes, as well as ease of access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors to the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, in contrast to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of its rotation, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable to its previous model and is characterised by lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine provides a high performance in all respects.
The output of 1.2 litres of resources is 90 hrs at 6000 hrs and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 hs.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
And the other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, is now reaching 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The impactor-méuuuuutó
To develop accident-preventing technologies this time, Nissan is a new invention of inspiration from the world of bees.
The Japanese company has designed a robot to avoid accidents following the fly of bees.
The Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step towards developing conflict prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Development Technical Centre in cooperation with the University of Tokyo's Development Research Centre for Science and Technology, Japan, built this little robot.
Kazuhiro Doi, Director General for Technology PR and Research Development, defines the further extension of the BR23C to Nissan's four-level safety shield.
The robot is making the company's products more complete with the potential to hit-and-run.
During the flight, every bee will develop its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
However, its role is much more important than that of the uterus’s complex eyes, which can be seen in every direction at more than 300 degrees.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers have designed a so-called laser telescope (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies the obstacles in the 180-degree visual field before BR23C within a distance of up to 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which will immediately become an action to avoid impact.
\"As a barrier occurs, the small robot, following the movement of the uterus, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is mainly distinguished from the instruments currently available, in this case the avoidable maneuver will be completely automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles – explain Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
In a way other than bees, the avoidable maneuver should not be directed upwards or downwards, and must not move in a diameter of only two dimensions and only towards the rotation of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and way, as is the case with bees.
So Nissan also used a rotation function in the robot in addition to acceleration and slowing to avoid collisions.
“This structure only has to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can operate with only a few dozen KB memorys without interruption.
It may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte-sized memories.
This is the first step towards the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which, based on Nissan's estimates, could involve serial cars within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more durable than the lithium ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional means of application to get the car to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of a mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury doesn't have a lot of cash to invest, they don't have any sense of reason.
Since the crisis is on their necks, and because Americans do not question the drivers of viable mortgage banks, they have created a fun and informative online game called Bad Credit Hotel.
This hotel is called the \"Ross Credits\".
The description of the accommodation and, above all, the reception duke suggests that we should think about it again, twice, even three times, whether the time has actually come for the borrowing.
And especially where to demand credit, because that is probably the purpose of it.
The information available on the website is really useful, but not very detailed.
It's more for teenagers than it's for the public.
But what would happen if we added the game?
For example, the hotel would show up in the room of our dreams.
Actually, it's something, because we don't even dream about buying a flat...
Morgan Stanley opens up capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that he has a share in the capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank is paying $ 9 billion for the capital of the company after the price of Morgan Stanley shares has fallen into the stock exchange.
One week after the publication of the preliminary agreement, the two banks said that MUFG was buying 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock companies at a unit price of 25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price leaves more than 19% of the book value of securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in exchangeable securities, which provides a 10% return and their conversion rate is $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is executed using a USD 29 average price, which is 28% higher than the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price dropped by about 6.79% at the medium time of Greenwich and closed at 23.07.
\"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley great opportunity to speed up its transformation into a bank holding company,\" explains John Mack, CEO of the US Company Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which could diversify its activities, while being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis calls for even more caution from corporates on Wall Street.
By the way, from the terms announced on Monday, the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday Morgan has only announced that 20 % of its shares are sold to the Japanese company for about 8.5 billion dollars.
“A week ago, we thought that the share would be made up of shares in total, ” explained Toshiside Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect the potential risks.
In terms of weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on one share is reduced by around 20%.
On the basis of the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its priority shares into shares in a single year if the trading price of the latter exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. around USD 47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that the funds from MUFG can make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not want to provide accurate information on the two new allied strategic plans.
Following the buy-in of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its solvency rate according to Tier I by around 15%, making it one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan stated that his scale has been improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, the group has been in great difficulty since the exchange rate of its shares has fallen to half, while the cost of securing non-payment risk has fallen into the sky.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
One of the major investor banks left the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers behind bankruptcy and the purchase of Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week was worth $15 billion, some of which came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa’s Monday Statement, Quito
Reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint plan for the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Rafael Correa in Ecuador.
On Sunday, following the pattern of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained her ideas about the new constitution.
His mission was successful, as 64% of voters voted yes in the referendum according to official results, which concerned 80% of votes.
28% of the population voted with no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the voters had been released unpublished.
The draft Constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two surveys at the end of the polling offices and one civil society accounting proved to be a huge surplus of \"yes\" votes with 63% and 70% dollars.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke of winning his draft constitution from Sunday to Monday night.
“ The constitutional victory was won in the first place, ” he said, “and in Guayaaquil, southwest of Quito, the governor’s headquarters, he said thanked the people of Turkey.
As well as the well-known, Rafael Correa Chávez, Morales, and Chilean President Michelle Bachel also congratulated him.
According to the report of the Watching Mission of the United States Organisation (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere, with a major issue of 444 precise texts summarising the principles of ‘new socialism’ protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution states the powers of the state to serve the economy, while maintaining the State's right to \"design development\" to a country that is essentially dependent on the production of oil from foreign companies and the foreign exchange from migrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, also strengthens the powers of the Head of State, who could obtain mandates for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to break down the Parliamentary Assembly.
Correa has already announced that she wishes to live with this opportunity and will be back in competition for the Prime Minister's mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution has also included free health services and education, and the President has already started introducing it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives under the minimum living standards.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which may put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of a Turkish facility based on US anti-drug measures.
Released 19 hostages in Chad
He was hit by an Egyptian commando on the kidnappers, who had taken eleven tourists hostage ten days ago and eight of them.
The hostages are in Cairo now.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the capital of Egypt on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad by a Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, about half past four o'clock in the afternoon they arrived with an airplane to the al-Maza military base, which is directly linked to the Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were banned from making a statement to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in the outskirts of Cairo, Mád, where they were examined.
The hostages were “healthy, ” and the kidnappers did not receive a ransom at the airport’s Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna, Egypt.
The hostages were taken in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya at Mount Ouanat on 19 September, where they were involved in land-going safarin. Then the group was dragged from one of the 35 unknown hostages to the other.
He was 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptians: two foreign drivers, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegret travel agency organising safarit.
According to information from a Egyptian security officer, a 30-member special commandos arrived on two helicopters at the scene, where they hit the hostages directly before the current.
“A firefight was formed among the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled, ” claimed the leader who asked for his name to be heard.
He also stated that a total of 150 special troops were sent from the Egyptian Flash Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, currently in Belgrade, underlined the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We should have known that this result could not have been achieved without professional and effective intervention from our secret service people and groups of our activities, ” he said.
He also refused to pay a ransom for the hostages.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during the patrols, there was a SUV in which the kidnappers traveled. Six of them (including the Chadan leader) were killed and two of them were arrested.
The army claimed that the hostages were connected to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately clashed by the organization concerned.
Lettres - Most of the culture –
The debate on the financing of culture is currently at the heart of the news and the election campaign that is currently taking place.
We can only be happy about this.
But they still forget about a section of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to illustrate the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archaeology digs and national historical monuments on the edge of the famine?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or do neither Quebec nor Canada have laws that truly ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Castle Chinon in Loire Valley?
And the Constitution of our neighbours in America states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, more than 40,000 volunteers of the Québeci Historical Society (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec) are engaged in the research of history, with a minimum budget for the conservation of large numbers of private archaeology and archaeological findings.
Often these organizations protect our heritage with their teeth and protest with the last force of the chanting, when the real estate developers and decision makers guide their bulldozers towards our old buildings and our forgotten cemeterys.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
They state part of Fortis bank in the Benelux Governments
Partial nationalisation will help Benelux countries to tackle the intensification of the US credit market crisis - as a first European - in Belgian and Dutch banks - Fortison: a total of EUR 11.2 billion is supported by a financial and insurance institution with interest in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch governments agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition responsibility.
In the euro area, Fortis bank is the first major crisis in the context of the international money market crisis that has been in circulation for more than a year, and decisions in the banking sector can therefore be regarded as precedent in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy up almost half (49 percent) of the bank's existing property there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, first and foremost, Dutch ABN Amro acquired last year - in particular, insurance activities.
In the second half of the week, Fortis's shares began to fall steeply, there have already been serious crisis events at the Institute.
They agree, however, that the bank is too large with its 85 000 employees to be allowed to fail.
The company's papers only dropped by about 12 percent on Friday, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the total market capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to corporate managers, this is not realistic.
The company management has, by the way, accused overseas market uncertainties regarding the adoption of the $700 billion US Package Plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers were slightly up.
On Friday, Phillip Dierckx appointed a new CEO at the bank's head.
The financial institution has been looking for private buyers, but no one has ever made a bid.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, do not lose their money.
The bank's clients have never panicked so far, the accounts have not been rushed.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and purchased leasing companies.
A fox in a hen
In America, health and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude insurance contracts with the applicant based on people's drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
‘There is a data protection programme which is in all cases linked to the consent of the person concerned to the use of pharmacovigilance data.
This must be in an independent hand, otherwise the henhouse “responsibles Richard Dick, the developer of the program to follow the prescriptions, Washington Post.
Insurance companies make insurance companies dependent on the state of health of the applicant client on the insurance premium and on the amount of damages and, if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not provide insurance.
The person was sent to medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the outcome of the investigation.
Dick has been developing a much cheaper procedure for ten years: according to the customer's ID number, it can easily obtain what medications he has been buying over the past year and the program itself concludes what kind of disease he is suffering from and what his health condition is.
For example, if you take a large dose of cholesterol regularly, it suggests that your blood fat level is virtually untreated, which immediately lists a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are in circulation, some also specify the number of risk coefficients, so the insurance company can hardly remain outside the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for several purposes, for example, certain compounds can be used against migraines or heat waves, but also against depression.
The latter is a significant risk increase factor for business insurers, which is not the case.
Special companies have been formed to request and process the data, and before they obtain the necessary information from the pharmacy, they will be asked for the patient's consent.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although no punishment has been imposed on them for their failure so far.
Some companies have further processed the results of laboratory studies and are linked to drug consumption data, so that patients can provide a more accurate picture of their health status.
More and more companies will have access to the data, while checking for use will become increasingly difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but only applies to health care providers and insurance companies.
The draft law, which gives the authorities control over the companies specialising in reporting, is before the convention.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his programme, which would link the transmission of data with the express consent of the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned may not refuse the contribution, otherwise the insurers will not sign a contract with him.
So the hens, however, are still referring to the goodwill of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
It doubles trade between the European Union and India
Since the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the agenda for the 9th Summit has been dominated by this topic, alongside the other, mostly global problems.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear cooperation will be mainly concerned.
The European Union recognises, however, that India is a high-level democratic power that should be given a greater say in international matters, but Member States have not yet reached a common denominator, to support the permanent membership of New Deli in the UN Security Council.
This issue was thus not raised at the 9th summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the Union and President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and High Representative Javier Solana for Foreign Affairs, welcomed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India, who was also agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. a great hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
In this regard, in the legal sense, twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been added, i.e. air traffic may flow in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiation.
The aim is to balance that while the EU is India's first trading partner, Newdelhi is only listed in the ninth place in the EU's partners.
The summit has given attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, have been condemned in all forms on both sides and called for the UN Conference to be convened.
They also called for the end of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large share of their previous failure.
The EU has confirmed that it maintains its energy and climate programmes, i.e. it wants to reduce harmful emissions by at least 20 % by 2020.
India also agreed that a global agreement should be reached at the future climate conference and that greenhouse gas production should be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050.
I would also like to hinder the rise in food prices and support the establishment of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where at the bilateral meeting he is planning to make a deal about the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they trust that in order to build nuclear reactors in India, French companies will receive a commission of 20 billion euros.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
At this year's Frankfurt International Book Fair there are 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries in 171.790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books are presented.
At the opening ceremony of Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by the Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture Javak and Activities: Italy, by setting up a single Italian Pont, will include 264 square meters of exhibition area.
The celebration opening will be followed by a press conference to be held in Buchmesse 5.0 Pavilon’s “Rom Struktur”, where information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian book publishing will also be presented.
According to the data, the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing the proportion of foreign authors, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
They found the billionaire Steve Fossett plane that disappeared a year ago.
They found the remains of the billions of Steve Fossett's flight, which disappeared on September 3, 2007.
The wreckages were found in a 3000-metre high altitude near Mammoth Lakes, located on the coast of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, all the doubts that still exist: “After the determination of the flight's position, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure that it was about the plane on which Steve Fossett flew off the day of his disappearance, ” said a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US Transport Safety Agency (NTSB) reported that a committee of inquiry was invited a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, which was able to identify the plane and to establish that it was indeed about Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day that Fossett launched a three-hour flight from Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday he also found some of Fossett's personal belongings near the home of Mammoth Lakes near the border of Nevada.
Two IDs for Fosset, issued by the Federal Aviation Control in Illinois, some cash and a sweater.
His search for Fosset was performed one month after he disappeared.
The billionaire set up a number of peaks that put himself in history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he also landed on a plane without landing.
There are also numerous records of the Andes flying at an altitude of 15.445 meters, carried out by a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
It is an unusual, yet original and definite-shaped hobby machine with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few cases, this is the latest ‘compatible’ truck in Mercedes-Benz, which the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
This is why the introduction campaign for SUV GLK will be surprising and unusual from 17 October in Mercedes-Benz's demonstration rooms.
Because the advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of a new vehicle has been using an unknown media-communication device, including those elongated by 3D blocks that were not used by the car brand in Italy.
The giant slact action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan's central shopping street, Corso Comót by 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the car’s space performance, in which the new SUV will be seen with special glasses distributed in Corso Como, almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional form.
The image's going to feel like the car's coming out of the poster.
After that, through the innovative Elumina8 technology, each of the new GLK's details becomes visible to each other, and then it is combined in a uniform way.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to introduce something innovative with this promotion into the stereotype of the automotive industry.
Can this raise the interest of future customers?
We'll show you who Italian football hooligans are.
They're probably out of orbit.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who is now ashamed of all Italy? Members of the group \"Ultras Italia\", which has been following the selection for years, and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
I've never been beaten with the fans of the enemy.
The core of the group is right.
The headquarters are coming from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padova, Triest and Udin.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller dispersal groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
Italian flags were flags on which they were identified as the hometown of the fans: on Saturday they took them so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, you were facing a real Nazi cheerleading team with the Levski drukkers.
The Italian football association provided 144 tickets to Italian fans. These were tickets to name, making it easier to check the Surkoló team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: there was no one to whom the people who were preparing for the Sofia procedure would have been in progress, who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans who have a record of football, refused ticket and exit.
At present, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for protocols from the Sofia Police to take the necessary measures: the fans arrested or identified during the riots may also be banned for five years.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to the visit of the Italian stadium but to all of Europe's stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't put their feet on a football field.
Lucky for you.
However, we must also fear that the Hulligans will be found followers, that is, that the few hundred and fifty people will join.
“There must be a fire that needs to be strangled; there must be no excuse for those who behave like this, ” said the Ministry of Home Affairs.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's match date is up in Lecc.
In Puglia, there is a smaller cell that supports Italian ultras.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting of the Monitoring Service, and on Tuesday the Security of Sports Events, a Senior Committee, which can also count on a department of Homeland Security, secret services for Surkolo's behaviour.
\"Duce-Duce scanning and waving arm under Italian hymn? In Bulgaria, there is no crime\"
This thought was expressed, rather unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzill, who was appointed a few weeks ago for the Ministry of the Interior's observer service (the post was taken by Mr Tagliente, before by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzill used to be chief police chief of the Triest city, where he has been operating since 2002 in a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group.
What Mazzill claims is not allowed to feed Duce in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of the 150-200 fans was disgraceful.
I'm not a sociologist, he's the first person in the surveillance service, but the crimes have to be judged in the country where the crime is committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems, we need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let's talk a little about the exorcism of the Italian hymn: it's not a crime, but, if I may say that, it's not a well-being.
