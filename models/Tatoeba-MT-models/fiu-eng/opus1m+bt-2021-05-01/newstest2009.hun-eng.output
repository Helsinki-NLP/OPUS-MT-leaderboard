The Prague Stock Exchange was negative at the end of the trade
The Prague stock exchange adjusted its losses after the crash in the morning.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) are close to half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague stock exchange continued to fall Monday from the beginning of Tuesday's trade when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, Wall Street's shares are behind the fall.
This is how the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote in the US House, which rejected the support of the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Shares in Asia
In the Asian stock exchange, the dramatic fall of the shares was experienced on Tuesday, although the indicators were finally deleted during the day.
The Hong Kong Sound Seng Stock Index described almost four percent during the trading, but later it deleted some of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index accounted for 3.8 percent of the Chinese shares, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock has lost more than five percent, but in the end, the losses decreased to 4.3%.
The Taiwanese Stock Exchange, according to the index there, fell 3.6 percent.
“The timing of the American rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world’s money markets, ” noted Joseph Yam, head of the financial council in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. regardless of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should start negotiations immediately and accept the financial system support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries are threatening to understand the consequences of this.
The Blood Bath of American Shares
On Monday, the American House rejected the draft financial system's support for which $700 billion (almost 12 trillion crowns) should have been translated.
The legislators therefore ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush believes that the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, American shares have experienced a blood bath and the leading stock indices have registered the biggest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones experienced almost seven percent of the fall last time in 1987.
The index was already before the vote, but once it became clear that the proposal was not adopted in the House, the index was released.
Congress has withdrawn: the US Government can pump $700 billion into the banks
The main leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed to provide financial assistance in the wider form of the agreement and to the American financial system.
That's what they're voting about at the beginning of next week.
US legislators have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns) of financial assistance to the American financial system.
But there's no victory yet.
The Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can make the final form and vote of the law public.
The draft financial system support will be discussed in the Assembly on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, President of the Financial Organisations Committee, informed the Reuters news agency.
According to Senate sources, the draft is likely to be voted on on Wednesday as soon as possible.
Economists consider that there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of money markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there will then be a \"excession\".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a major step.
We have solved our differing views about what should be the form of a market stabilisation package,\" said the Bloomberg Agency, Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
He said that the final vote would take place on Sunday.
On Saturday night, the legislators met Henry Paulson, the U.S. Minister of Finance, to give the final form of the government fund.
This should purchase from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that will bring financial companies into serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
\"We are able to reach a final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The corrective plan should continue, but I think we are there, ” said Paulson.
Marking for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling rapidly.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the lawmakers are therefore trying to reach an agreement in Congress for the rest of Sunday.
For this reason, they want to reassure investors before trading in Asian money markets, where the decision of Congress could first influence Monday's trading.
It is not clear, however, yet, when the two chambers of the US Congress vote on the law, as is the case, whether the trial could not be lost at the last minute because of a problem.
Lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
In line with President Bush's request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount set out in an additional $100 billion and later 350 billion if it feels that the programme does not perform its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may oppose this decision, he may over-examine the veto of Congress.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was the acquisition of financial assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, was maintained, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgage loans.
\"We've worked it all out.
About the law, the House should be able to vote on Sunday and the Senate on Monday, ” said Senator Judd Gregg Republican.
The progress made in the negotiations was also satisfied with President Bush.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesperson, stated that the president was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated the two-party efforts to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy.
Restrictions on bus charges
Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiations, president of the Senate Committee, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the closure of discounts, and the timing of the draft funding.
The new law also restricts the so-called bus termination of the Programme Directors and establishes a Foundation Monitoring Committee.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We worked very hard on this, and we made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will benefit all Americans, ” Paulson said.
The plan also accounts for the assistance provided to the owners who have problems with the repayment.
The government should make up new instalments for the mortgage purchased by it with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of taxpayers and enabling them to keep their houses.
Marek: spiritual aid
The proposed draft, David Marek, head of administration of Patria Finance, says it's a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“It is because it is not possible to know what mechanism the problem actives will be purchased and at what cost.
This will be crucial for the financial sector and the government to divide the losses between each other, ” said IHNed.cz to the week iHNed.cz website Marek.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or early next week.
“It is more important that the Congress decide this week to support the plan and, as soon as possible, give their blessing.
The importance of reaching an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at the moment, ” said Marek.
A couple of tights: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We'll help you choose
While almost all mobile files can play MP3, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it's better to buy a phone only.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use it and the needs of the future owner.
Probably hard to get a high-quality record player at home to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on bagels, but there is no objective reason for doing so from a qualitative point of view.
However, if polcai is full of art rock, jazz or blues with bagel plates, then he is likely to dream of such a record player.
This is similar to traveling, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories here too.
For some, it may be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a 20-cron market earphone.
Two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
There's a wide selection.
Life expectancy of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players are able to do much more than simply play music, but also to which most mobile players are not by chance.
No device now is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, calling and texting, music and video you can play, record both, have a right-of-the-right camera, and even navigation.
And if we take into account the smartphones and the communicators, he'll have a small computer in his pocket.
It's a miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
Multiple function mobiles have disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the phone, the more the display you send to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy addicts.
Few mobile devices can play music for a longer period than ten to twelve hours, mostly less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
So count on cheap mobile phones that they won't play for you more than a few hours.
Even if you're on the phone here and there, get a charger to work for safety - this applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will have no such problem, even worse ones will have a continuous operation of at least 9 hours.
The next problem is that it's being uploaded to the cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB converter and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without any special software.
Of course, music can be directly recorded on the memory card, but only a few card readers can use it without a adapter with mini-space memory cards in the mobiles.
At the players you don't need any special software with some exceptions (iPod).
Enough with the computer to upload the device via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players already create their own music library, the name of the album, the genre, or, for example, the music library lined up according to the user's assessment.
Some devices only represent a fascist structure like Windows Explorer, and they know a few of them (irever, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
For the selection of specific equipment, first of all you should ask about battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output, and, of course, the comfort of the treatment.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and listens only for a short time a day, for example, any MP3 player's mobile will be suitable for you.
And that's what any cell phone is capable of.
You don't have to pay particular attention to the music formats that your mobile or player can use.
With MP3, all will cope and the majority of the final music that comes to you will be in this format.
MP3 is among the most widely used and also includes the vast majority of devices with WMA music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and iPod) is less likely to occur.
Better mobiles also allow online music shopping, for example.
Enough to visit the appropriate sites of the service provider (or other service provider) through mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service can already be a strong argument for obtaining a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, service providers offer poor and generally limited to only one summer radio camp.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that music will dominate the music industry in the future (through GSM, the Internet or wireless internet).
Most people keep their mobile devices on their own all the time.
Any time you want to listen to something, your cell phone will be smothered in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether he still carries earphones or at least the speaker.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with which almost all mobile players have only a few MP3 players.
Many music phones are likely to have the greatest advantage in the price.
The cheapest usually cost less than 30,000 crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a decent walkman.
Mostly, however, you are limited by the lack of traditional earphone output.
Phones with traditional 3.5 mm diameter earphones can be placed in up to 12,000 crowns from the best and technical point of view.
At the same time, the players have the advantage of being easy to manage.
The simplest - no need to treat the cheapest players (see our choice) really is the problem.
The minimum function, which is comparable to a regular tape recorder or gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of a collapse in the form of accidentally activated mobile internet, nor of the huge account after that.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually opened on replaceable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can also purchase the right card into a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Only cards with maximum capacity up to 2GB are supported by the basic types.
Only the most expensive ones can do what they can with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy even a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iirever.
On the basis of the capacity (max. 2 GB) you will not have to spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you belong to the more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the treatment is convenient to approach the MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Ericsson has reached the highest level, which has the same user interface for walkingman's serial phones as separate MP3 players.
The above mentioned brands can provide the same MP3 player service in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider is still arriving in Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our suppliers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, we have something missing here - the virtual service provider that has forced classic service providers to significantly reduce their prices.
Maybe it won't be long.
On the Mobil.cz website, we have written many times that Czech service providers in Europe are among the most expensive.
It was also confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of sms in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
Following the last step of the European Commission, the regulation of roaming charges may lead to a conflicting situation - the cost of sms from abroad for some of the Czech mobile service providers will be cheaper than domestics.
How can Czech prices be so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is high at 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This often agrees with Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, who said several times earlier that there is no place for a new service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider with its own network is not likely to have too many chances (though it is probably difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - the virtual service provider.
The introduction of the mobile market for virtual service providers has led to a significant drop in prices, which the classic service providers must then respond to.
Meanwhile, even before the big fish went to market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virginia Mobile in Great Britain, sounds like ours were heard.
However, it has been shown that such service providers have their place and can indeed be successful.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
This February we informed you about the departure of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider has managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers in less than six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, behind the Mobilking, Penta is a financial group, which is owned by U:fon other than the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate effectively, the traditional service provider needs much less customers.
There is no relatively high cost of construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world thus tend to display low cost calls and SMSs, which are often less service-balanced.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, a very good move can also be made to a target group.
This service provider is particularly focused on men.
“The real men choose the Mobile dating service provider - who they like to trust, ” says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company operating this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether such an idea like that of Poland can be applied to us.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesperson of Vodafone, doubted: “The Czech market is relatively small to the segment approach on which most virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory for the supply of services –
In the Czech Republic, there is no possibility of mobile service providers
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be mobileking.
\"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic, consultations do not seem to be too hopeful.
The launch of mobileking takes place in other countries of our region, said Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the Penta Financial Group, in his phone interview with Mobil.cz.
In other words, it has been demonstrated that existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not too involved in this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition is created.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of a virtual service provider for some time, which therefore intends to take another step in order to make Phoneica O2 a genuine competitor in the field of corporate clients.
“We are very interested in providing not only fixed, but mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
The sooner, the better.
This option has been discussed repeatedly with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations, ” says Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson of the group.
There might be better times.
It appears from unofficial information that the first virtual service provider can be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence for the time being.
\"In this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would be located on the Czech market.
Unlike other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been invited by an incompatible subject offering complex and serious projects in this area,\" said Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica 02.
The specific situation of the Czech market is also referred to by other service providers.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson of T-Mobile, exceptionally in agreement with O2, adds: “So far, we did not mention any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects to which we could be further established.
He added: “The T-Mobile network is unlikely to show up by the end of the year for any virtual service provider.
At this moment, there should be a specific agreement on our table to be able to think in the short term.
Vodafone focuses rather on meeting its 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are now able to negotiate with potential virtual service providers, mainly in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
For our customers, that is exactly what we consider the most expensive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to pool partnerships to build networks shared with fast mobile internet.
Responsible offices - a string with service providers
The procedure for mobile service providers could easily be understood, the entry of another service provider would lead to an increase in competition, a drop in prices and a reduction in their profits.
So why make it easier for us to access such a competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate, they also testify to the huzavona around the birth of U:fon.
The maximum pressure on ČTÚ was probably about the birth of the U:fon of the T-Mobile company.
This is borne out by the publicly available information on the ČTÚ website.
But right now, U:fon needs a good argument that why not let the virtual service provider enter.
Martina Kemrová added: “The environment for competition in the mobile market has recently been entrenched by access to the fourth mobile service market.
Given the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is obvious that the entry of a new player into the market and services would lead to high requirements.
However, given this attitude of mobile operators, the complete inactivity of the Czech regulatory authorities is quite amazing.
In the meantime, it is not just the position of ČTÚ, which unfortunately has no right to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
Only the Authority is authorised to do so.
But the agency has a specific relationship with the problem.
\"A move to the mobile market for a virtual service provider would only be possible after the contract between the mobile provider and the virtual service provider is concluded on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, since the offer of potential interested parties is probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers,\" said Kristian Chlapua, the external relations department of the Economic Competition Authority.
A statement thus made from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and also ensure that no one can recover from their market situation, this is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristian Chavo adds: “In a foreign country where virtual service providers generally operate, we can observe that their market move has contributed to reducing the price of mobile services.
However, the interest of the NEWS is unlikely to include pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and price reductions.
In this case, it is indeed shocking that the three mobile service providers' reactions can be very consistent.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence? It's almost self-evident.
As at charging stations, the exact same gas prices are certainly just works of random and hard competition.
“The Office did not identify the signs of the anticompetitive procedure in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. no greater responsibilities in terms of market circumstances.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing for the telecommunications regulators,\" Chalua said.
Presentation of the leading market situation is one of the many debate points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the perspective of economic competition.
After that, of course, no Czech service provider is in a position of leadership.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the establishment of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile provider has a relatively logical network of its own.
So in a particular segment, it's necessarily dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be a minimum incentive for NEWS to have three mobile operators acting in a very similar way.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including the GTS Novera mentioned) show that there are very similar obstacles to the negotiation of all service providers.
The responsibility for the ČTÚ in telecommunications is a relatively common trick that the NEWs take off the whole case.
That's how we met in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of ČTÚ in the field of economic competition has failed to pass through telecommunications, although many experts have hoped to improve the situation.
This is what UOHS representatives need to know, but they are probably others.
It works when no one's listening.
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of false virtual service providers that already operate in Czech mobile networks remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own mobile phone price lists, but which are only partially public.
This is because they are multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bosnia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company is performing against the provider as a classic corporate client, which provides a large amount of SIM cards.
You will then receive special offers (and other discounts) as a top customer.
The problem is that the commercial conditions for all Czech mobile operators are prohibited from making similar claims.
“If there were cases that you are talking about, we could be talking about an infringement of the terms of contract that we would be dealing with and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company, ” said Martina Kemrová.
But it is unlikely that news about such activities would not have reached the responsible people of mobile service providers.
In particular, for the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of clients.
In the meantime, no service provider is protecting against such a procedure.
These companies have no negligible profits and, unlike real virtual providers, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: “The law allows similar speculations, however, only uses the services of these companies as a negligible percentage of customers.
They also need to accept that the SIM card on their phone is not included in their name, so it cannot be fully provided as the general customers of mobile service providers:
But that's exactly what ČTÚ should be doing.
There is also another question for the NEWS.
If mobile operators miss a similar procedure, why prevent virtual service providers from being born?
It should be added that the NEWS has relatively strong rights to expose such activities and that, if you do not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the reasons made by the service providers that nothing like this was suspected and that the conditions of trade are prohibited.
When we're not gonna be the most expensive
As stated a few times in the text, access of virtual service providers to the mobile market has brought a noticeable price drop in services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers have been established, classic service providers have sought to prevent them more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, at these very moment regulatory bodies were involved in the developed countries, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Then, even with formal measures or informal pressure, it was achieved that the first virtual service provider, which others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are giving each other the whole thing.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is indeed published soon, the Czech mobile market may be re-moved.
If one of the service providers would allow the establishment of a virtual mobile service provider, the NEWS will only be difficult to remain indifferent to reject further interested parties (discrimination).
And, compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be going to make more expensive calls.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech state hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolán presented the new collections of my country on the Czech State Day.
The hymnus was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlav.
There are four versions available - male or female solos, singing arms or instruments.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are singing.
The authors of the amendment of the hymnics Otakar Jeremiš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions of the iHNed.cz website.
The Czech national song is considered to be one of the most beautiful hymn.
The Czech Radio had already been told earlier that he deliberately selected young representative singers who were expressative and popular to sing the current variations.
“I’ve been looking for a clean dividend, a good understanding of the text and consistency since the beginning, ” he said.
The Czech state hymn celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where I Am My Country? was first silenced at Rendi Theatre in 1834 by Josef Kajetan Tyl Fidlovačka, accompanied by František Škroup's music.
He became popular, and people looked spontaneously at him as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state hymn after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
How is “the new faith ”?
For the first time on Wednesday, Prague Transport Company will also deliver a chip card
On Wednesday 1 October 2008, you will enter yourself in the history of the Prague Transport Company when you enter the subways, trams and buses by the first passenger who will have an electronic coupon in your pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available for about a hundred thousand people with the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30 days and 90 days and an annual coupon (which will be valid as of 1 January 2009) and at their information centers and offices of the Transport Company at Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňay, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons are already available online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 clients until afternoon hours.
Those who start using the internet trading system can completely forget the metro stations' voiced windows, where they had to follow regular lines so far.
The coupon can also be purchased via the Internet and saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
“In these places, passengers have a desk with trained servers who help the interested parties buy the internet and save their coupon on their cards, ” said Martin Opatrný, the spokesperson of the project.
Besides libraries, electronic coupons can be saved on Opencard in self-service machines fitted in some halls.
How do these machines look?
They're red, they're reminded of the ticket managers, and the passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
“ There are currently five of them in town, but it should be 80 by the end of the year, ” he added.
The coupon is checked automatically instead of the driver
Their operations tomorrow are easy to handle for start-ups.
Enough to insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be lost by itself.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital, but also around it.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which residents of central-Czech villages travel to the capital.
“On integrated trains in Prague, fish roads were provided with card readers that also determine the zone performance of the coupons, ” explained Philip Drápal, the organisation that combines the timetable for public transport in Prague.
In busses around the city, card readers are built by the manager at the wallet.
When entering, therefore, the driver must not only show the chip card but also place the Opencard in the location specified on the side of the wallet.
The driver thus checks the validity of the coupons.
“If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way to ask the driver is to do so, ” added Drapal.
Passengers who do not travel buses around town and will not remember when the validity of their coupon is down may again go to self-service machines that save coupon cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudanese wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945, the Germans requested to be associated with the United States.
This is found in a letter from the collection of the Scientific Library in South Chechnya.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the United States of America's cartridge.
It is claimed that in 1945 a few groups of Sudanese Germans turned to the president of the United States.
This is also reflected in a letter from a private arch that is currently held in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Chechnya.
The Germans of Česky Krumlov in the letter ask the President of the United States not to allow the rendition of the “Sumava County” to the Czech Republic, which was also taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Treaty.
“The situation has been correctly interpreted and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops come to the German territories in no way as a suppressor or enemy, but as a liberator, ” is in the letter, “embers who carry the fate of Shumava on their hearts, signed by words.
Since the addition of Czechoslovakia to the Germans is supposed to give hope only to brutality, incoherence, not to understanding, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter calls on the President of the United States to take over Šumava, both now and forever,
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this area would be considered a foreign country that would suppress and overthrow the minority and would not contribute to the victory of allies, ” says the letter.
The reason the authors could not sign, allegedly fear of revenge for the “cash suppressors. ”
If, therefore, the President of the United States claimed to doubt the opinion of the Shimava Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Shimava County as to whether its residents intend to become part of the United States and to live under the occupation of the United States.
Although the letter’s text may seem somewhat naive in addition to the current knowledge of postwar history, some historians correctly picture the expectations of the Sudanese Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to have minimal suspicion that they would be removed from the country, only a few of them would recognize this possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would settle in a kind of autonomy for the Sudetians.
Again others were confident that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chaluo, Austrian journalist born in České Budějovica.
During the war, Chaluo served as a German seaman at the Baltic Sea.
At the end of the war, when the British were arrested and taken to Holštynskói prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans added to teach them in Czech.
“They trusted that when they returned, they needed the Czech language well, ” said Chalou.
According to one of the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one calculated that Beneš was expelled from the country on the basis of the Decrees.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
Emotional campaign attacks leaders
In Czech history, the most expensive action for road safety.
The media campaign on emotions which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday would also be characteristic.
The office of Minister Aleš ρebíček from this campaign hopes that he will deter the leaders from being dangerous behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
Leaders should be alerted to speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them that their seatbelts are being doubled before they leave.
First of all, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers want to know their conscience.
And what's in the commercials?
Emotional, primarily human stories.
This is borne out by the campaign's \"bloody\" blog:
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The expression “unthinking ” on the plate is written in large letters.
And the blood clot also includes the word “pay. ”
This must be a symbol of a person’s being paid with his life for a moment’s lack of attention.
The viewers are alarmed until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns from the English Saxony countries, where dramatic images of victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
Advertises were created by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, let it go to the drivers.
\"True it, let it go\" is valid for drivers.
For example, \"see\" is when they go through the red and save time.
'True it's the danger of a penalty or an accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk, ” says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist's thinking.
According to him, the driver's attention is less effective than the tablets calling the threat.
“If the hazard warning board is fitted, it is likely that it will quickly reconcile with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it, ” he warned.
He would give back almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Mr Olmer, the president of the provisional Israeli Government spoke about the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. from the west coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Fennsík, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He said this in an interview, published daily by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
“We have to make a deal with Palestinians, which means that almost all of them, if not all (inhabited) areas are to be returned, ” he told the newspaper.
“ We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians have to transfer a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without it there will be no peace, ” he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
“He who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass through his feet, as one of my best friends have done, must give up part of Jerusalem, ” he noted, referring to an attack on two July cities, during which some people were killed and several dozen were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for “the temple mountain, sacred and historical places. ”
“He who wants to preserve Israel’s sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work, he stressed.
Out of the Golan bottom line
He also expressed an opinion on the removal of the Israelis from Golanfensíík, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require a certain effort from Damascus.
“I do not recommend peace bound with Syria only on the basis of the exit from Golan, ” he warned.
“Sirs know well what to cancel so that they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must communicate their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Silent Movement); they must provide regular support to the terrorism of Hamas (Silent Movement), Al-Kaid and Djibouti (Szent War) in Iraq,\" the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after the accident: Are passenger escorts illegal in buses?
The law doesn't know them. You can't walk on a long distance bus.
In relation to the tragic bus accident of Student Agency, the question of whether passengers and passengers can travel on the bus was raised near the Italian Padova.
“If we were to comply strictly and formally with the law, the passenger’s activities conflict with the legislation on transport activities, ” says Karel Hanselka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the driver of a 20-year-old passenger’s death probably caused the bus to cross the bus.
The girl was sitting next to the driver at the moment, the bus was at the least safe place, though there were two other places for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake at the moment the passenger’s accompanying coffee is served or offers a newspaper.
There is an advantage as to whether the bus has its place of residence under the licence.
If the bus is not homologised, passengers must sit.
Student Agency has no remote bus stations; confirmed to Akulalně.cz by Radim Jančura, the company manager.
“We tried to find a solution with this Ministry and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this was withdrawn, and we came to the conclusion that passengers would be able to make their own seats on the road, if they had their own seats, and that they had their position on the road.
The law doesn't know the cabin attendant.
“There is no clear legal framework for the passenger’s role - no legislation regulating this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services by the carrier.
The Road Traffic Act only recognises the driver’s concept; it does not define its rights and obligations, making it less obvious to Hanselka spokesperson.
Mr Pokorný, Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, considers that the law treats the problem properly.
‘It depends on whether or not the bus is registered.
And it's over, ” you say.
Buses may be on a discriminatory basis in urban areas where the maximum speed is limited and at higher speed between the city and between the city, as well as without seating positions and with seats with safety belts, with maximum speed and maximum speed allowed.
Like on the plane, says the expert.
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP transport security expert, in the movement of passenger passengers on board the bus, sees no basic problem.
“In the course of continued progress, there is no threat, and the situation can be compared to that of the aircraft.
Even here, when there is turbulence and a cabin attendant can beat his head,
“If, however, the bus would suddenly be held back, of course, its physical laws will apply.
Same as in urban buses or trams.
Passenger passengers’ safety must be solved by the carrier’s internal rules, says and believes that the problem has not been solved from the perspective of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove services
Student Agency offers passenger ancillary services as the sole bus driver.
Two hundred passengers.
After the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
\"But as I have the impression that the work of cabin passengers is risky, I will also end it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers upon arrival.
That would be cost savings, ” she says.
In his vehicles, safety interests were justified by the lack of passengers Alexej Litvin, the director of Asia, who operates a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency.
“ We do not have passengers, we oppose this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal injury, ” he told Týden.cz only a year ago.
It's an incredible tragedy.
The company’s two-year-old passenger passenger car driver died during a trip to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably pulled out of the stopbar without using the direction indicator and pulled off the bus.
The bus driver suddenly tried to get out of here, but the front of the bus ran into him.
The fact that the two reserved places for the rest of the passengers were also sold, Jančura rejects.
\"There can be no reservation, blockage,\"
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
By compensating the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the court to judge, but also expect financial compensation from the victim.
Law change?
In the Far Future
The clarification of passenger passengers' movements on board the bus could be a change of law, which has been working for more than a year by the thirty-pronged expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
However, the group did not achieve any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with maximum speed and mobile usage during driving, ” says Hořín experts.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passenger passengers to be essentially a threat to the safety of passengers, ” says Hanselka, who said that the control of the safety of buses is a matter for the police and the labour services.
The Dusseldorf Hopes Over Frankfurt
The letter to the bank staff from WestLB's board of directors does not narrow down in big words.
From the merger of the units of the Dusseldorf financial institution and the Deka-Bank Frankfurt, the central capital market organisation of the savings fund financial group could be created - the letter published Monday would be published.
The WestLB would take a permanently profitable \"competition block\" into a business like this.
Such a link could give a decisive boost to further concentrations in the region's banking sector.
This is a reading of a board wanting to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
For the uncertain situation in WestLB, there is still great pressure on the bank.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Inspectorate, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia Government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution would be limited.
However, the relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB has been a subject for savings fund clients for a long time, including in Frankfurt.
Franz Waas, the Head of Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, at the end of the presentation of the mid-term data, has been informed that there is no understanding of the merger between Mainzer Landstraße and a regional bank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, one half of which is representatives of the Land Banks and the other half are representatives of the Mining Associations, has commissioned the Board to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
In doing so, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be involved.
However, the negotiations - which are being set up by financial circles - have just begun.
The name Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employers of the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first person to be involved in the consolidation of the savings fund sector.
For a moment in 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to join Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, the three covenant did not become anything.
The plans were barely published, the Hessen Land Government voted against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead took place at Stuttgarti Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka Bank and the Land banks has been re-enacted and re-enacted.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, the board president of Helaba spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, there is a need to recognise the need to approach different banks in the individual sector.
Now, following the regional elections in Bajoran, the relations between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected first.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on additional wheats is increased, the potential partners may run out slowly.
In South Germany, only a better partner could be, although the financial crisis has so far been significantly more severe than the München and Stuttgart banks.
The fusion with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüring, a business company in Helaba.
The NordLB's better off.
However, such geostrategy considerations only mean one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises how each bank has different business models.
Merl stated in June that the German Monetary Fund and the Jewish Confederation have not yet answered the crucial question of what kind of business model should guarantee the future of the Land banks.
Finally, there can be a piece of WestLB, which they certainly do not wish for.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors there also states that they are in any way seeking a “full solution. ”
How this can be reconciled with the unity of the units with Deka-Ban is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the weekend of Italy.
This is the first time Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena's here as her girlfriend, and so everything's different, Luca says.
Behind them, next to the five-litre barrel of the Kaiser brand, there is a strong-shaped bearded man, proving to some 200 people how deep he can draw out of his throat.
Elena first loves Luca's face, then she kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses from the parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova Railway Station depart at 23.45 p.m.-destinazione Monaco, paints on the della – on the road, arrival is expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly for Italians, the fourth only for Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing by their flags, starting to celebrate during the night.
And so loud, that's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing a large silver-silver jacket.
She's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years. She's only organized three trips this year.
At 2:30 p.m., the Oktoberfest is home.
Accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenses, say Marco.
The journey costs €75, which includes the welcome Kaiser beer, accident insurance and German tour - Marco Frankfurt, a German language course.
And they're already putting themselves in the busses for the night on the freeway towards Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
All right, they'll still need their strength.
They're in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses take a short break before Munich on motorway 8.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are here, Marco is holding one last piece of information, showing the plan of war.
First, everybody pick up the yellow cap.
On the left hand side, the letters ‘Oktoberfest’, followed by Marco’s travel agency’s Internet address: ‘Conoscersiviaggiando.it’.
Secondly, “When the beer can be opened, Marco yells“ out into the morning.
\"Fouter\" means the reservation of the locations in the back of the tent.
“ Not in advance, for we are stuck, and let not all the yellow hats sit on the same pads, but spread it out in the tent, ”
The one-litre chord costs 8,25 euros, screams Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
“Show the security guards that you are well behaved.
As you leave your seats, they are taken.
Third, “Be back here at half past eleven o’clock this evening, ” you understand?
And we're on our way to the Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men puts yellow hats on the trees, on the boards, and even on the election poster of one great Bajoran couple.
We need to prepare for the retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as “the weekend of Italy. ”
There are no accurate figures; there are 50 thousand people who cross the Alpocon in the beer bars, and ten per cent of all visitors to the weekend come from Italy.
Seven South-Tiroli police officers confirm that Italian volunteers assist the Bajor Red Cross, which, in its national statistics, includes about 200 medical services, Italians take the first place, preventing the Austrians (about 80) and the British people in need of the lowest level (about 60).
Among the Italians, Hofbräu is particularly fond of beer.
Dreamless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasised by the Federal Minister for Finance of Peer Steinbrück just last week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word ‘ in proportion’ and, to say, even the German banking sector was not spared crisis-like developments.
Because this weekend came along.
Daxon's listed Hypo Real Estate (HRE) real estate finance company received a billion-dollar loan from the consortium of German banks to protect itself against market failures.
A person who knew the situation announced on Monday with Reuters that credit subsidies were worth EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only after the part it takes.
The money is partly from private, partly public banks.
In the background, the Depfa subsidiary has losses.
Depfa, which makes public funding, has provided funding for long-term projects according to the newspaper, and has refinanceed itself for a very short period of time - which is now not possible because of the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 % to EUR 2,37 million and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1,6 to 1,45 %.
The current income and net revenue from the money companies fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, the revenue from the credits and fixed securities and the liquidation of the loan company's reserves totalling more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only the higher revenue from the reimbursement of the ex-post conversion costs of the former Depfa group and the relatively moderate revenue deficit of 16%, due to the reimbursement of interest on the tax regime and the business of the companies in the Consultant Group.
The former state financier first speculated with corporate real estate loans after privatisation in 1990, which later became separate in Aeral Bank.
Since the classical state funding could be limited, Depfa has been more strongly involved in infrastructure projects and in private investors and public projects (privat-public partnership, PPP) and has expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of the subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate must now provide descriptions that are ‘essentially affected’ for the purposes of demonstrating the results of the group, which have been reported fairly generally.
The fact that the payment of dividends was not made.
The dividend has already been reduced to a third in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier since Depfa was taken over.
In comparison with other financial institutions, there is a better dependence on interbank market refinancing, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the lending of banks between them fell to death, as banks maintain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets to refinance part of the Depfa credit portfolio - some EUR 50 billion - per year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the Group's funding needs are covered by the credit for a limited period of time, and the company's protected – at present, from the influence of highly inefficient international financial markets –
According to other sources, the refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
In contrast, Georg Funke, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group does not have to use the money markets for a limited period of time.
The German Federal Bank and Federal Financial Services (Bafin) see that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now guaranteed.
It gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and incomprehensibility of the crisis, some cannot be certain.
Even money does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite can't be ruled out.
After the late Saturday night news said that the bank was still on the edge of the bankruptcy, it was not even a transitional rescue that could calm down the fields.
The share price decreased by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the bond rates hold themselves quite well.
While the first-place debt changes little, the exchange rates of the back-up bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis affects former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo’s bonds and is likely to affect future maturity exceeding 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds have appeared to be a speculative alternative to investment, they now need to be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system and the fact that the financial institution has taken the crisis almost to the house by taking Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and the less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, the repayment of the benefits may be based on the deadline.
Or it will happen, where almost no one is dared to hope that the financial crisis will be resolved in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports on partial nationalisation, the likelihood of certainty has now become just a legitimate reflection.
For long-term creditors, it can cause dreamless nights to decide whether to withdraw from their investment.
However, short-term investors can use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on the exchange rates of the coming years.
Sylvana and box secrets
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hilton has to introduce himself in the Tachibana High School on the first day of teaching, the girls start to whine:
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word about the mangoes in the new exchange blog about Japan.
\"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavaszaki, and travel by train for 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, and luckily I didn't miss it.
It seems that the beginning of the teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start to scream from eight hours until a short conversation with the teacher starts at 8 a.m. at 40 p.m., the \"home room\"
But before the teaching began, I had the line to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I've picked up my housewife's old skirt, wearing shirts, blue knees, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in this dress before the catheter and tried to say everything correctly: “Sajonara, vo se Sylvana... ” I came from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, squealing, and waved, and I kept hearing the word “smug. ”
I've known that from my manga.
This is part of the Japanese girl’s basic vocabulary and means, ‘ cute, sweet ’
And then I fell into my place quickly.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely, and it was an honor to have planted her next to the replacements.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the bell was ringing, they were runnin' out of order.
Everyone spoke and laughed, and they put a hole in their stomach with questions - and it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
After that break, everyone packed their insides.
My guest has made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spiced rice, little sausages, salads, fruit and a kind of tofu roasted meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Foods look strange, and they have completely novelty taste.
It's a fact that everything is very good.
Yeah, maybe with the exception of salt potion, brr!
In Japanese schools, inside is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy her own hand made bees, especially as artists - in the hope that she can get closer to the boy during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
“Why, ” my friends in Japan asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
\"Because you're just charming,\"
After all, for years, I've been the most eager to read mangoes.
And to understand better the comic books and the culture described in them, I started to learn Japanese at some point.
It was absolutely clear to me, then, that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to traditions and habits.
And they're very well-informed here.
Japan is, on the one hand, a country of latest techniques and trends - and, on the other hand, a strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen.
Rats have feelings, too.
Runs away in a rat or a mole in danger. Does that mean that you feel fear?
Joseph LeDoux's neurologist is convinced that animals have feelings.
But how can you examine whether they feel the same way when they act like us?
For years, famous scientists have published their articles in the Edge Internet magazine.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of the series “What Does Real, Without Proveing ” you will look out for answers to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other consciousnesss, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, but it's true that we can't even prove that other people have knowledge.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we look at other species, and in general we dispel questions of consciousness, we come into a difficult field, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he's doing the same thing as many other animals: pretending to be dead, running or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, leading some researchers to comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to carry through our subjective experience with animals.
Human consciousness circuits almost always contain the periphery prefrontal cortex (for short term memory and the role of implementation/control functions).
This wide area is more advanced for humans than for other mammals and seems to be completely lacking for other life-forms.
At least with the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal brain, for example, the awareness of who we are, or, in the case of design and decision-making ability, it is reasonable to assume that man is different from the other mammals.
An additional dramatic feature lies in the language nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often said to be dependent on consciousness.
In this case, the animals may be excluded.
However, even if it did not depend on the language, the language would certainly affect, so the animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is likely to differ strongly from most of our state of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective matter, and because of special hardware, it cannot be analyzed based on our own experience, then its research puts us at serious problems.
Most of my thoughts relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
The animal's consciousness processes could be examined independently of the content, and this is exactly what happens in the case of short-term memory experiments for mammals, especially in the case of visualisation.
However, in the assumption that Christof Koch and Francis Crick are also considered, they are more based on the nerves of consciousness than on indirect mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
In an interesting way, this assumption also highlights the importance of prefrontal cortex in the development of visualization.
What are the consequences of this?
This is reflected in the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call ‘ fear’ is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the protective system that is located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) is involved in work memory.
In this way, the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the brain corpuscence that are characteristic of the primary mammals, and in particular human beings.
In addition to language, the perception is divided into fine steps, because words and language can help us to distinguish the conditions and to classify them as well as others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that emotions are derived from simpler activities in the areas of the brain and the brain stem, as well as from Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overall feelings of species.
Well, theoretically, I can't deny it, but I think it's unproveable.
Panksep believes that what appears to be fear for rats and humans is likely to feel it in both cases: How could rats and humans be checked to see if they feel the same thing when they behave like them?
A roach runs away in the event of danger, does he feel fear too?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not evidence of the same experience yet.
Although neural collapse continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, cockroaches have no brain.
But the brain stem is responsible for the emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans, how can we prove this for rats?
I think rats and other mammals have feelings, but perhaps even the cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are likely to be essentially different from ours (based on special circuits of human consciousness and language), I am researching the emotional behaviour of rats as an emotional emotion.
In any case, progress in this area has been narrowed at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Like I don't study language and consciousness for rats, I don't know if they exist.
It may seem a short-sighted attitude to others, but I'm moving forward rather than constantly bumping into walls.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, Chairman of UEFA: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik announced that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government, in its decision of UEFA in Bordeaux, sees confidence in Ukraine and evidence that they believe that Ukraine is able to organise a European Championship with Poland, ” said Vassjunik.
\"This does not mean amnesia for our country, however.
Work has just begun, and much remains to be done in both countries,
Both host countries are failing to build stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums is reduced from eight to six.
“We cannot waste more time.
We need to work with a high speed, ” said Grigorij Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
\"UEFA will keep us in mind –
In Poland, they planned themselves for a more radical step.
Following a number of scandals, the National Olympic Commission suspended the Polish Federation of PZPN, which was replaced by independent Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Mr Drzewiecki Minister for Sport.
There is “a serious risk that PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules, ” Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP news agency.
“In addition, we assured Michel Platinum, the president of UEFA, that this would not adversely affect the preparation of the EB 2012.
Only in the past year's time we had to put a number of first league teams into the lower class because of manipulation, and eventually we had to postpone the league.
The atrocious Dennis Quaid is cutting back
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, talked about her private life in the interview, and now she's in trouble with her ex-husband, and Ryan Hollywood's star is considered a adulterer, Dennis Quaide.
Anyone who claps - and cuts back
The late rose war of Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex - married couple: The two Hollywood actors fight a bad fight seven years after their divorce - before the public.
Meg Ryan, during an interview with the American InStyle magazine last week, said about the causes of the divorce: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, with which he has caused so much pain. ”
And he only found out after his divorce how many women Dennis cheated on him.
On spiritual strip, Ryan’s new press work on “Women ” film was done, telling a history of adultery.
Dennis Quaid firmly responded to the cry of unfaithful husband: “It’s a great thing, ” said 54 - year - old actor on the “New York Daily News, ” that Meg’s boringly repeats and spends the history of our relationship.
Furthermore, it is “a pity ” that 16 - year - old boys, Jack, are repeatedly reminded of the many pains and changes caused by the divorce to a child.
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid got married again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Hence, the answer closes with the following side cut: “My life continues at all times.
I can feel happy that I have a wonderful family in which everything is the best thing about it,
Flights and hotel rooms drop
For the first half of 2008, European air travel and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, in Germany, the airways were less than 50 percent cheaper.
Airway and hotel room prices have become more favourable once again - so it is possible to sum up the result of one of the studies of American Express's travel and financial service providers.
The company analysed its bookkeeping data for the first half of 2008 and established a significant price drop in the second quarter following the first quarter of the price increase.
After rising prices on the hotel market for years, many accommodation has become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities examined increased by 6.9% on average compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is American Express, in a low exchange rate of the dollar, which led “to the plight of American tourists. ”
The fall in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London, such as industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In Norway, the 26.3% increase in hotel prices is a European record.
As regards the prices of air tickets, there was also a growing trend in the first quarter.
Due to the kerozin gliding, passengers had to pay more than in 2007 on average 7.1 per cent in the tourist class, while long-term flights with high fuel demand were more expensive by 29.2 per cent.
Between April and June, the tourist-class fares decreased by an average of 12.5 per cent from the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, prices showed only a very moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent and decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany decreased by half.
The price reduction is due, on the one hand, to moderate economic growth - the company claims.
The airport market has weakened demand in a number of segments.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, strengthens the pressure of competition.
The tense situation is demonstrated by the cancellation of their loss-making flights by airlines and bankruptcy reported by several airlines during the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV 1:0 beats the Gladbach
With a goll and simple methods, the tabella led by Hamburger SV.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flight for the national selected Marko Marin.
The gladbach player only got into the game late and raised back from the gate.
His written message clearly left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
“We need the second goal, ” says Hermann Rieger, in his corridor to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them were back in position.
For nearly three decades, Rieger had the physics therapist of the HSV, a greater authority than some Hajdan players.
So you found a hearing on your request at the competent place.
Cornelius Jol rang, and he agreed to show his thumb.
Cornelius is the chief coach in Hamburg, Martin Jol's brother.
His command could be similar: Here is the second goal.
The order has not been implemented.
“It wasn’t always a good sight today, ” later met Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt was more likely to imagine it.
1: 0 (1: 0) gollos results are due to Mladen Petric head of Hamburg (11.); and the circumstances that very weak gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
\"It was a tight victory,\" he added Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV is 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena, and the display table, which showed their team as top of the championship.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
\"We know where to put it,\" said Marcel Jansen.
It is clear that its certificate between the tabletsella indicates more the unpredictability of the league than that of the HSV.
Although the team finds it slowly thanks to the late dedicated services - to the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Porteric and the FC Bayern, Jansen - but is not yet available in the market.
“ We need more sense and clarity, ” says Jo.

Dark material affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing unruly among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of the space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of conduct of Albert Einstein cannot be fully correct.
The \"Ulysse\" space probe flew in space for almost 18 years.
The soon-growing fuel pipelines threaten the ice-death.
For years, scientists have been causing confusion with a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravity price range of space probes, in which a heavenly body, such as the Earth's gravity, can be obtained with additional momentum.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe also used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar system.
However, what has been encouraging researchers for years now is that flying objects are not fully behaved as if they were expected under the ancient gravity law.
Instead, disorders occur at speed.
The probes suddenly speed up or slow down.
Physics have so far found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized in swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, considering the mass draw of the material as a curve of the space.
Stephen Adler's American Physics, the Prince's Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and the swing-by anomaly is trying to explain with so-called dark material what the astronauts discovered in the universe.
“For the anomaly, dark matter may be responsible, which may be found even near the Earth, ” says Adler.
World Filterers have only learned about the existence of dark matter ten years ago.
Obviously, there is a gravity force that is observed to have an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light does not release or beat back.
According to scientists, the total mass of the universe is one fifth of the dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt have been released
After ten days in the captivity of their kidnappers, tourists in Egypt are once again free - the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs has confirmed.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of euros of ransom.
In the shooting prior to the release of the hostages, six hostages reportedly lost their lives.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are in progress.
Again and again, they become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are free.
It is also reported by the Egyptian public television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
According to reports from the Italian Sky TG 24 TV tax, Italian Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact that release was granted: “Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We are currently examining their health, ” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian citizens and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and sound - reported on Egyptian public television.
19 participants of the desert expedition are reported to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting prior to the release of the hostages are still vague: According to a Egyptian security officer, hostages have shown their willingness to release hostages when the Sudanese army has surprisingly killed their six.
\"The problem has been solved.
The ransom was accepted, said the official.
“It was just a negotiation about taking hostages, ” when suddenly “the surprise ” happened.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over to one of the hostages' German wives.
Referring to a German broker, the Al-Masri al-Jom reported that the release of the hostages was carried out because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostages release women's hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men will be held by the kidnappers until safe escape is found.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
\"Annihilation\" - \"Mohohohapa rape\"
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepdad raped her for years.
The Cornwall County Stithians spent 57 years in prison, Michael Trerise, who lives in St.
The Truro criminal court found that she regularly signed her stepmother Stephanie Randle between the five and seven years old.
In one of Trerise’s statements, he wrote: “I feel responsible for my death, ” he said.
The trial stated that Randle, at 34 years old, was killed in a home in the city of Mutley, in the district of Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes and tied her eyes to her marriages while her mother worked in a beer shop.
Trerise left her wife in the 1980s and was once again elected by Cornwall.
Most of his family moved to Olympoth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteer at the National Trust monumental organization, was persecuted by the nightmares of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, the D.A. Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had a passion for surfing and cycling, said her friends, “the emotional dead, ” and“ told me about life, ”
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment in lymphoma.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle got in touch with her daughter’s stepdad, who finished her testimony in a letter saying: “I always tied her up and tied her eyes.
I wasn't sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for your death,
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetisist, and I'm sure it was terrible for his victim, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim killing himself.
However, the fact that if he did not do so, the case might never have been brought before the court.
The judge added: “I would like to point out how Stephanie’s parents thought it had affected the girl of your crime over the years.
If this did not happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman,
The officials who lost important data have been charged
According to the BBC's reports, the government official has been accused of a breach of his official secrets on a train that left strictly classified documents on a train in June.
The man was posted from the Homeland Department when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the simplest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of deliberate crime.
According to Frank Gardner, the BBC Department of Defense reporters, the step has surprised many in Whitehall.
“It was believed that the Ministry of Defence and the Government would treat the case as an internal case, ” he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed has been accused under point 8.1 of the Law, which is a paragraph on the preservation of information.
The State Prosecutor's Office suggested that the prosecution against the official be brought against the Metropolitan Police is represented by the man because of his rather sensitive work with regard to the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was informed on Monday of the decision and moved to a place unknown from his home.
The housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
British housing cooperatives can count on an account of more than 80 million English pounds after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent 14 billion pounds on the protection of Bradford &amp; deposits at Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, the president of the Association for the Construction of Homebuildings (BSA), that companies and members must pay.
The reimbursement of the 14 billion important loans will eventually be made after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgage.
However, interest accumulated in the meantime is charged annually to 700 financial companies that use loans.
The compensation system for Financial Services confirmed to BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are one of them.
It is annoying that institutions that have so far been carefully responsible ... now have to pay the accounts of the institutions which have been very cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company has to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit that the companies hold.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to put 81 million pounds to pay the interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, head of the housing company's union, told BBC that he thought the measure was unfair.
\"It is damaging for institutions to pay the accounts of institutions that are much less cautious at the time of the recovery of the housing market,
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
“In all respects, we have to look at this case in the next few weeks to decide how we can protect the housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bill, ” added Cole.
Interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, a full annual interest will be paid, which can be even twice now.
Since housing cooperatives are self-helping organisations, without shareholders, the members will eventually have to pay the invoice, either through higher fees or at lower interest rates after their deposits.
Milk prices rise with fivepence per liter
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey announced that it would increase wholesale prices of milk by a further fivepence per litre from Monday to Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the rise of the twopences in February and following a survey by an advisory company.
The resellers themselves decide whether to pass on price increases to consumers.
Before the rise in February, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey changed last in 2002.
Requested by an earlier parliamentary representative of Bangladesh to defend himself in prison
The Bangladeshese court rejected the request for protection of former MP Sheikh Hasina in the patent, which means that they can arrest her when she returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him in the free house against charges of blackmail of 50 million pounds (729,700 dollars) from a businessman during his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of the countless charges of corruption against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaledda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina will have to return to Bangladesh for the next few weeks, but she agrees that Awami League demands that the provisional government supported by the country's army give her full freedom first.
According to the reports, even though he was placed on parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of free foot-and-mouth provision that he can retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
Lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appeal court.
“The Court of Appeal dismissed Sheikh Hasina’s application for bail that it was not necessary, since she was temporarily placed on a free leg and is undergoing foreign treatment, ” we learned from Rafique, lawyer Huq.
\"We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal,
According to his lawyer's arguments, he needs to defend himself on the loose so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League on Sunday said that Sheikh Hasina was expected to return home after 17 October.
Last year they were arrested for taking over the power of the military-sponsored temporary government, but in June they released him from prison so he could go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns concerning the vaccination programme against polio in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 children from Afghanistan have been excluded from the recently organised polio vaccination programme due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has organised a vaccination mission in six provinces.
However, they said that for safety reasons they could not reach children living in certain parts of the south of Helmand and Kandahar.
According to a UN speaker, all this has happened despite the Taliban promises: they will not attack or prevent the work of thousands of personnel who have been vaccinated.
The appeal of BSkyB against ITV was rejected.
BskyB’s appeal was rejected against the decision of the Competition Committee, which instructed him to reduce his interest in the rival TV tax in ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
In the past, the Committee concluded that BSkyB's participation is an obstacle to competition and confers unfair influence on the company over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL - which has since been named Virginia Media - in the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV would jeopardise the ITV's independence by encouraging the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The director of Virginia, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom supervision were all opposed to buying.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in ITV's share was pointless and disproportionate, especially in view of the BSkyB's statement that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. Attorneys' case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the loss of the nine U.S. Attorneys of the United States in 2006.
The step followed by the report on the case by the Chief Justice Officer of the Justice wallet criticises the decisions of government officials.
The report was judged by the officials of the White House, the legislators and former state attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was fear that the state prosecutors were lost from political consideration.
Nora Dannehy, Special Prosecutor will now investigate whether officials who have been heard during the investigation have tried to prevent justice by lying.
“The serious accusations concerning possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not even been clarified –\" said Chief Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who was in charge of prosecuting witnesses.
The series started in December 2006 with nine state prosecutors removing the US Justice wallet.
At that time, they said that the state prosecutors were released for poor performance.
However, later it turned out that the state prosecutors in the past received no worse assessment than many other colleagues. Many of them concluded that political consideration was drawn behind the discharges.
Some state prosecutors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others refused to take part in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against the Democrats.
The U.S. Attorneys are investigating the government's orders and running court cases.
They can be lost at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
He was then led by Alberto Gonzales, the chief state attorney of the court, who was targeted at the loss, and finally resigned.
A number of other officials in the Justice wallet have also given up their resignation.
In his report, the chief inspector had a great deal of criticism of Gonzales’ role in the case.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, were judged to be an elder in Bush's earlier investigation.
Meat Loaf is awarded eposa
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition for the epic hymn of “Bat Out Of Hell. ”
The singer who takes over the special gold prize next week at the London celebration said that it was an honor.
The nine-minute, fifty-second-long song of Meat Loaf's 1977 album titled the public-scrapers.
Coldplay received the highest number of candidates for this year's prizes, has been placed in four categories on the candidate list.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and “Bat Out Of Hell, ” such as:
The song Jim Steinman got was very loud, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song started with a almost two-minute musical profession.
It appeared as a little record in 1979, and it reached its 15th place in the hitchrist.
However, Meat Loaf’s album Out Of Hell has been present on the hit list for almost nine years, and after that, more than 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf - a real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently suffered from health problems. Among other things, in 2003, due to his heart rhythm disorder, he had surgery after he fell on stage.
In 2007, she had to cancel some concerts due to acute inflammation.
Later it turned out that there was a cyst on his tone.
Unknown major city street, often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of distances, tours and other sideways, some of which are famous and others have a purely practical function.
However, many trained taxi drivers and long-standing local residents can find out where the Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village, and it's heading north from the First Street without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long, and more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There are no street tables.
Technically, you can't find it on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, Avalon Bay, building the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to redecorate the Extra Place, and he wants to make sure that he can get on a cleaner path to the shops and buttocks of new buildings.
The admirers of the street include the long-standing neighbors who were captured in the bone street, that this was the only residue from the past before the renovations in the area.
However, it is not necessary to insist on the owner of the street, the building and development department of the city.
This month, at a meeting of the Regional Government Regional Management Committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the building manager would buy the street.
However, the Committee would prefer the street to be in the management of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted by next month, reported Susan Stetzer as the district manager of the 3rd municipal council.
“There are very few areas in the city and we want Extra Place to remain in the city, ” he said.
“You may come to know that there are proposals for refurbishment and treatment that Avalon can make, but we also want to guarantee that it will remain available to the public.
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to redecorate the small street, and he wanted to provide seats. These would be part of a coffee shop, which the building manager is supposed to rent.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the street was first made public at this monthly meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson of Avalon Bay, told me that although the company wanted to use the street, they did not insist on its possession.
“Avalon Bay’s main point is to renovate this covered alley and turn it into a pleasant public helly, ” he said, adding that the city suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Buildings Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for the development of the buildings and not for the management.
Compared to his colored neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place is not much of a historical significance.
According to some, in 1802, Philip Minthorne’s great estate was named “the land of his country ” when he was divided into a vast number of children and no one was in need of a narrow groundband.
The punk rock monument closed in 2006, the back exit of the CBG, opened to Extra Place, and the street may be the most important one, was the photo of the album Ramones-Rocket to Russia.
“It was a good location, ” said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
“You’ve had garbage, clothes, barrels and posters, wood leaves and ropes, ”
Some residents, including bloggers, who wrote about how they owned the middle class East Village, opposed the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, whatever it is, should remain in the community's possession.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare, which is a practically unchanged part of the city and which must be left at peace.
Jeremiah Moss, writer of the Siralmak book of Jeremiah, New York, wrote a blog entitled “Siralmak, the bitter nostalgia of the death of the city, ” in 1952, a part of the story about Extra Place, published in the series The New Yorker, entitled “The New Yorker. ”
The author Brendan Gill wrote: “The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is still dark during the day, surrounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and spallet windows, and with one week’s news in the wind’s canals.
Except for a few exceptions, the street looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran over at the end of the street, next to the back door, which used to drive to the CBG, and now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store.
It was a graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75-lit beer bottle was lying next to a drop of fresh paper.
Some walkers told us that they rarely remember the Extra Place, but they think we could use the refurbishment.
Fields told me that some people think that they underestimate their attraction to the current state of the street.
“ I spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, whirlwind and disgusting places, ” he said.
Debate on Two-language Education: Consistency of the English Language Environment
In this section of the Education Observatory, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the views of candidates on multilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher of California studies and head of education research at the Pacific National Research Institute, is “Not as good as you think: Why a middle class needs a choice of school, ” co-worker.
It is not easy for voters from Spanish.
The proposals on Barack Obama's education are also included here.
Obama’s campaign says that “the students in Africa and Spain are significantly less likely to gain a degree than white students, ” and that is true.
In order to overcome these performance differences, Obama's education plan explicitly supports, among other things, transitional double-language education for English students.
At the same time, Obama’s question is whether its commitment to two-language education, which places emphasis on school education in non-English, outweighs its interest in tackling high performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep prep contract primary school in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school's students have Spanish lips and low incomes.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of fourth graders have achieved excellent results at the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Similarly impressive, 93% of fourth graders have performed excellent English language and literature exams.
This incredible performance is not achieved by the device Obama prefers.
Sixth Street places emphasis on repeating, practice, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
Furthermore, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school educational principle of English students is “a complete appreciation of the language environment.
The essence of the approach is that the English language is almost exclusively used when teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who objected to the two - language education, said: “We had a huge success in walking into a classroom and not seeing who was the student 12 months before he arrived from Mexico again, ”
\"He's working,\" he says, \"We're working,\"
Will Obama set schools like Sixth Street Prep as an example to be followed by a significant number of Spanish schools that teach students in Spanish lips and English?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear that the answer is clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported dual-language education) and because they themselves are consistently in addition to the two-language education, we cannot be certain of Obama’s reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently spoke with respect to the question when he said that people should not be so concerned about the law - making “excessaryly English mivolta. ”
Instead, he said, “They should be touched to make their children speak Spanish, ” he said.
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of overlooking them and ignoring them.
Oil prices fell steeply due to renewed economic concerns
On Monday, oil prices were steep because of concerns that the rescue plan for financial markets in America would not be able to reschedule the economy.
The stock of crude oil fell by seven percent to $99.80 this morning on the New York Trade Exchange.
The prices have been reduced by over 20 dollars per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock exchange has been undermined by the financial mess on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the price reached USD 145,29 per barrel in July, almost $90 was recovered at the beginning of this month before the impact of the immense uncertainty on the financial markets was restored.
On Monday, the concern reinvigorated investors even after the Congress leaders announced: they managed to agree on an economic rescue operation, which is the biggest in history.
The news was shadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for long.
At the latest events of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy the bank business of Wachovia Corporation, announced on Monday by the government.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European Financial Conglomeration, Fortis.
According to the Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, “it seems that the rescue mission has failed to bring about the trading advantage of the stock market. ”
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods, such as oil, will also decrease.
“The future of the market for fixed capital, interest rates and exchange rate prices worldwide has become uncertain, ” wrote Deutsche Bank, an analyst for investors.
\"We think that the market for goods will not be avoided by the \"circumstances\".
The most important question for the stock market is the extent to which the US's disease, the whole world, in particular China, is infected.
As the economic growth slowed down by oil consumption, the analyses of banks failed to recover from their expectations for the next year, reducing their oil and gas prices by 20% by 2009 forecasts.
With the second quarter of his record set,
After spending more than eight seasons of time in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who was in a defensive position, thought he'd seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter of the launch on Sunday when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational game.
\"I've never seen anything like this before,\" Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback 12-yard touchdown pass given to Laveranues Coles. This has become the perfect for an afternoon in which their co-operation has developed significantly further.
Favre gave even two touchdown passes to Coles in this quarter, including when two cornbacks fell ten seconds before the end of the half-time.
“ I did not feel sorry for the trouble, ” told Favre about all the passports to Coles.
\"He's a hell of a player.
So far, we were able to communicate with each other, no matter what people think,
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals' leader, Kurt Warner.
The cornback player Darrelle Revis caught a bad throw, and he threw it back with 32 yards that hit the touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safety player stuck in another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebager managed to kick the ball out of Warner's hands.
This could have been the most amazing move in the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feelly kicked a 20-yard field, thus setting the 34:0 score.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved so far in a quarter.
When asked to coach Jets, Eric Mannini, to characterise the senses of the game, he said: “The second or third quarter -
When they told him that both in the third quarter of Cardinals received 21 points that Jets did not get one, Mangini said: “I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third one.
We've got a lot of points in a short time.
The rest of the day, Gebrselassie, will break his own world record.
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider it to be the best medium and long-range driver who had ever lived in Berlin on Sunday when he broke his world order, and he became the first to run the 42,2 kilometers in two hours and four minutes.
At a convenient level, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds by 2:04:26 during 2:03:59 on the previous result of Gebrselassie last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set up the 26th world record of his career in a wide variety of fields, either from 1500 meters to marathons or has won world championships almost all over the world.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that it may have proved to be excessive caution - that air pollution would further aggravate asthmatic problems.
Instead, he named me the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - during the day, initially at 9 °C, and at the end of the 13 °C - won Gebrselassie Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes at a speed per 56 seconds.
Since the marathon's earlier non-starters, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Terga from Kenya, turned towards the longer term, the marathon record has decreased more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 by 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, he was stuck with his two legs, and he couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, during the forced rest, it was fresh and not rusty.
“I’m so happy, ” said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
“ Everything was going perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but eventually everything was fine.
He received some criticisms - especially from Kenya, the Eastern African rivalry of Ethiopia - that he uses too many aids in his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathons, he calls on the Irish people to run on the track, and places the world’s orders in front of the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie’s grandeur in the long run.
Gebrselassie reached the peak on Sunday with the four kenya tramps at 1:02:04.
Two sharp-lines of bread, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the Irishmen got out.
Not much more than 4.8 km ahead of the goal, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with one last sprint, who reached 2:05:36 in second place, with 5 minutes to improve his individual best.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the female competition, Irina Mikiteenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory of 2:19:19.
The World Summit is held by British Paula Radcliffe with 2:15:25.
In the past spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won a surprise with a result of London's marathon 2:24:14.
It was not due to the alleged injury to the Beijing Olympics, but it was quickly healed and won the Berlin marathon, where five minutes of improvement on its individual peak.
He won the contest with a reasonable count: first he allowed a group of four people of Ethiopia and Kenya to advance and make a significant lead and then about 30 km after they ran.
Ethiope Ascale Tafa Magarsa reached second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya became third at 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of black people
The Greater Orange experience park - a few miles away from everything that shines loud and powerful - lies in a quiet small town where the pride and complications of African-American life have been born.
Eatonville, the first purely black town that was integrated into the country and was a childhood home of Zora Neal Hurston, is no longer as simple as it described in 1935: “The five lakes, three croquets, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guajava and two school cities, without prison, ”
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been attending the Zora Festival each year.The eatonville ceremony is held in honor of the most famous female writer of the Harlem-resensian, Hurston.
Yet, in many respects, the city that it described and made to be a tourist attraction, which is also contained in the Florida guidebook published by the Federal writers of the Period.
He was just as independent, dignified and closed as Hurston in the 1930s, when, according to a writing by Hurston, city black people often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who “some know about us that they do not know what they are missing ”
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open debate on the racial issue, many here are untrustful of the looks of the outsiders.
“We take great care of how our story is told, ” reported the 59 - year - old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life, and who is a member of the oldest church in the city.
\"It is important to say this\"
Eatonville has long been characterised by a paradox of victory and battle.
At the same time, the historical model of black exits is a community of almost 2400 people, where poverty indicators reach the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of American slavery, sometimes looking down, sometimes praise, southern, urban, black culture, flourishing in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are proud and protective at the same time.
The picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora, (that is how everyone calls Hurston).
In the books written in an honest, strong figure, such as \"Mules and Men (1935)\" and \"Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937)\", he presented his hometown to the world.
The Florida guidebook transformed the city into five paragraphs, which lies next to Route 17. This road leads from Florida's long forgotten center to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave both in life and literature, whether he was a drummer, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke's business, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: “From the way we find the modern public school, on a brown basis with a white segment, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller is looking after, although he can hardly write and read,
He mentioned her new husband, widow Dash, and he wrote that Lee Glenn sells all kinds of drinks and whatever it is necessary for temporary accommodation.
Thus, in a few hundred cases, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarry and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description really didn't like everyone.
“Zora told me things as they were, ” reported Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, a Johnson girl.
He added: “Some people didn’t like this, ” he said.
Hurstona here is still remembered as the first individual who visited home often after her family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston went to the city, he usually arrived unannounced in Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes and, in his long-term pants, in a town where people are even proud of their dignity.
Most of the people were enchanted, said Franklin, but a lot of people were flooshed.
“The people were always happy to see Zora, ” said Franklin.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair: “I have stayed for too long, ”
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer released again.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with much of the world, forgot about it.
Although he was never a popular writer, his contemporary Langston Hughes, and the only black woman in the Barnard College in the 1920s, buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived before.
There were no significant reminders or large, public readings in Eatonville.
“I don’t think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all, ” said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston biography published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
The officials of Orange County wanted to build a five-track road through the city instead of the two-track main road, the Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated Interstate Interstate with 4 motorways on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still on foot after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, fighting against racial confusion has tasted hatred with society.
“A large group of white boys came over and threw them off the side of the road with oranges and other things, ” said Franklin.
\"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw a Greek dick out of a car.
In a letter written in 1955 in The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court on violent integration.
Today, the inhabitants say that school deparation was positive in some respects, weakened the unity of the Eastville people, and undermined the confidence of young people.
“The black children used to kill them - which I remember - the man killed his teacher in the morning and evening - reported by daughter of N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins, the managing director of the non-profit organization called the “Republic of Elatonville.
“ This took time for students and teachers to come from a common place, ” he added.
“ We did not hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us, ” Nathiri said.
However, human rights helped many other Zora Neale Hurston rise - in black writers, actors, and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, just as he has done, with faith and ranks as follows: “How anyone can deprive himself of the pleasure of my company!
I can't understand that.
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to her unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight to restore his reputation.
Five years later, a recognized Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was added to the shelves of bookstores.
The road construction project was just about to begin when the most famous girl in Eatonville was brought back to the heart of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors looked at him as a savior.
The community started organising a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what would destroy the county's highway.
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the ceremony every January.
A few years later, the county ceased its road construction proposal.
“The expansion of the main road led the community to a relived, full speed, which means real civil pride, ” Nathiri said.
Boyd made it easier to say: “Zora saved Eatonville...
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
There were growing numbers of people outside the city, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to go to church in 1993, and the locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national history list in 1998.
In 2006, the new, single library (naturally named Hurston) was opened on the re-hulled and built Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville continued to be Florida's cuckoo house: it's not nearly 10 km away from the centre of Orlando, but sometimes it's a feeling that a sidewalk in the suburbs would be in summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They're still taking care of the outsiders who come here looking for what's going on in Eatonville's story.
Most interviews require prior authorisation, and a few things, such as the oldest fresco of Eatonville, which is painted by a white man and a black on the ground, should not be photographed.
Many people in Eatonville, including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to the sharp red, fear that their separate community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival became increasingly widespread, the pride of the hometown has increased.
In particular, young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own tree: they are wonderful, problems, and together with nothing better, they are not worse, they are as proud, creative, industrious, foolish and confused as the other racial and ethnic groups in America.
His honest civil attachment to Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who's planning to return to the local government after he's completed college, or to the police, who thinks he needs help.
And it seems that the younger people have learned to correctly describe Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most people who travel here think that this town is nothing compared to the others, ” said Alondra Kenon recently after a Sunday.
“But if someone stops and wants some time to get to know his history, it’s a very beautiful city, ” he says.
We're all talking finance here in New York.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If the tourists didn't care about the news market booths and the huge TV commercials in Times Square, I wouldn't notice they're in the middle of a storm.
They would never find out that with the glass wall, bee-shaped offices over their heads, bankers and venture fund managers, who have held power to New York since 1929 have lived the hardest days.
The couriers still roll their metal tea trucks through the sidewalks carrying table trays with muffins for the morning meetings.
Still men with Spanish lips creak between blocks, carrying 50-footed shirts as human mules, hanging through their shoulders, similar to that of the ram.
The office workers are still in line for their sweet bakery on the sidewalk, and it's still impossible to catch a taxi on Tuesdays between 4 and 7.
I didn't feel there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the bad news, I didn't decide to open a new bank account.
I was planning to take care of it in my local account of JP Morgan Chase bank during the afternoon's rest, but I've already had 20 people in line.
Not at the banker's window where you can pick up money or pay it, but at the customer service counter where senior clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me, I later learned from Starr, “from banker to me, they were in line with the same purpose as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks located in their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from the so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), loan cooperatives, and small-town savings funds that only operate in one state and allegedly treat their clients as family members.
In the last year, 15 such banks have been silently destroyed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in capital, was put under bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers went home on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, the Wachovia, was a bank-storage buyer with a savings of $440 billion.
I've got the office and shop staff that's got their money transferred to a bank that seemed safe safe to the bank that makes most of the capital injections out on Wall Street.
Simple people from New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at the local Chinese store said she went bankrupt about Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague.
Lyn, the manager in my apartment's block of uniforms, 50 years old, changed the subject, not Brad and Angelina, or my food shipment, as we used to talk.
He spoke to me after I went to the bank: “I invested all my savings in money market assets.
I'm not risking it.
The Muslim tombs were abused, while Austria's key to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the right-hand Austrian Freedom Party, and Phillip Dewinter, the Belgian right party, Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp, 17 January 2008, on Thursday, on which he presented the “Miss of Islam” to the organization Ellen.
They were accompanied by signs of traffic signs that portrayed red-lined trades.
According to the police, the extreme extremes on the far right are responsible for the abuse of the Muslim funerals in Austria, which took place on the same weekend when the extreme right parties were significantly in advance in the national parliamentary elections.
It was more than 90 graves in the trams next to Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as David's star, to a few graves, but according to the detectives, they were trying to hide their extreme motives from the Muslim hatred of immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked to elections in some way.
A spokesperson from the local Islamic community said that they were “suffered ” at the time of the cries, which was the Muslim religious month, not long before the end of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting an examination of the conscience following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance is to the right.
The two far-right parties, which acquired almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the Freedom Party and the Alliance Austria's Future, for a strongly anti-immigrant law, and thought some of their blogs were critical of the xenophobics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Freedom Party, which has received more than 18% of the votes, expressed its campaign against heads and bulls and its failure to interact with the foods that are alleged to be associated with Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, the party spoke about “European brotherhood, ” which would prevent Islam from being strengthened.
Both parties want to ban the construction of the honeys and minies, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamicisation of Austria and Europe.
The public polls and analyses conducted directly after the elections that led to the extreme victory, show that the change was largely due to the young polling base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from a foreign trip
Garry Glitter, convicted of rape of children, was known rock star for his stay in France and Spain.
The judges then decided to ban Glitter for six months that he informed the control authorities that he intended to travel to Spain through France.
The police in Kenya obtained a ban on the journey to Thursday after submitting evidence of the convictions against children against Glitter.
Glitter, known as Paul Gadd, was not involved in the trial of Kenti Ashford Magistrates, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesperson at the court said: “On Thursday 25 September, the Chinese police applied to the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain on 25 March.
\"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person,\"
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it is bound by the law on persons who commit sex crimes.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
He's also obliged to inform the police at least seven days before the scheduled departure.
If he does not notify the authorities, he may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
The Kent Police said they don't want to talk about individual cases within Glitter County and about the possible location.
The Kent police spokesperson said: “Cinti Police will do everything they can to protect children within the country and abroad.
“It is easier to check someone if they do not leave the United Kingdom, because there is a comprehensive system here that we can manage potential risks more effectively.
“The most important task of the police in the field is to protect Kent’s population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of persons in the record of persons who commit sex crimes and who live in the county to minimise the potential risks to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for rape by a 10 and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The rural authorities did not let him through the passport test, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities were also not allowed to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where officials from the rural police and immigration authorities insisted on returning to Great Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the West London court, Uxbridge, because he was recorded in the record of sexual offenders under a court order under Scotland Yard.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison for the possession of photographs of child rape in the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to a source from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, was pleased to accept that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I do not take pictures on stage because I want to present the artist on a personal page – Günther Bauer Photography
There's no decoration, no football, no dancing shoes.
Without the excitement of the performance, Grand Masters of Flamenco: to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
The artist on the one hand.
On the other hand, an ordinary person.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in moments away from the inner audience, when we can have a personal movement, grab the depths of a captured view, or we can gratify the beauty of the unworkable, unspeakable hand of the artist who is not a stage action.
In the German Günther Bauer Flamenco-ople photo series, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less known ordinary side of masters.
Through the photos, Flamenco presents its unique iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which reflects the growing international importance of Flamenco Photography Day to day by day, is considered by the creator, adding that the Flamenco-people character could be anyone, since the images are seen by the observer that these images are not typical of artists.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, pleasure to the stage... and capture the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their personality and character are found in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create a inner atmosphere that would allow the camera to allow me to inherit the personality of the greats of the flamenco,
The Cante de las Minas festival gave impetus to Bauer's long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of Flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a record camera.
These portraits, thanks to the camera and theme selection, quote classic photography.
However, the use of various stylistic tools is broken by traditional image imaging and modernity. The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer’s idea of Flamenco: \"This is a music with traditional roots, but it is changing from day to day and always impressive –
It's not dancing, it's not singing or music itself, it's the artist's personality, it's the character of the audience.
In the days, the leading motif of the works seen in the El Fotómata gallery is the search for the essences, the encounter of the artistic oscillation, which is seen through the way of perception, existence and display.
The figures of Flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, describe this photo collection of 60 artists.
The project has also become Flamenco-totologology, which will soon be released an album of portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits for two years has been about the portraits of “Veteran athletes ” series “SportARTproject.
Although Flamenco-people’s concept differs slightly from that, the photographer adds: “I like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult piece of photography is portrait.
You're meeting people who sometimes don't even know you or who just want to take a few minutes to photograph.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I'm always trying to achieve my ideas.
The exhibition selected from the portraits of the contemporary flamenco-people will be held in El Fotómata Gallery, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, under number 20 by 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he works on is “pretentious. ”
The site and the act are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing his new novel.
Yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia event, a leading writer in the Nobel Prize, admitted that his current work was “ready for certainty ” and“ every sign of not having to write a novel.
“If I were smarter, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it and hope I can do a point at the end of the day, ” he closed his presentation with these words at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and opinions, which took hundreds of writers, historians and journalists four days in the city of Aqueduct, as well as thousands of visitors.
“The author of the city and the dogs was one of the most outstanding participants in the celebration of literature, and he also brought in the hopes that he had raised.
Vargas Llosa won an old edition of her novel Hay Festival, a novel from Dickens – our mutual friend. His performance filled the Juan Bravo Theatre.
After the welcome of Félix Romeo, the audience was quickly welcomed by the clock, during which the author of the potato had a wonderful memory experience and a great amount of humor to tell us how he developed the writing profession of the special adventure of his reading passion and the desire to live life; how he bridges the lack of inspiration with his written methods of writing, insatiable documentation, with many repairs and re-sigrations; how his works are built on the profession of his writers Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what his memories are built.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but added: “I do not think that literature is mere entertainment or the experience of Tisavio, as it affects people and thinking, so it is impossible for the writers to let them avoid temptation and responsibility for their calling.
The most dangerous weather makes it shorter for Pozoblanco to say goodbye, the horse bullfights are missing.
Traditionally, the horse-riding bullfight, which was held as the closing times of the Pozoblanco holidays, was deleted from the show yesterday morning after the future horse-ridors found that the area of the arena was unfit for wax.
As a result, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to abstain from bikavia.
The weather conditions have thoroughly built up the celebration series, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, rainfall left with the second bullfight.
The future main players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista would have fought the bulls of Castilblancó.
So they only held a bullfight on Friday.
The winner Daniel Lucque became, took home three ears as a trophy, surrounded after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle.
On the same afternoon, by two bulls of Renamed Talavante, he received a ear as a trophy, but this was thanks to the audience rather than his own performance.
However, El Juli followed, who had little contributed to the ageing of the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience was able to get out of the probe.
In his stand a two-ton truck tried to escape roadside inspection.
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
The Basque Regional Police are carrying out traffic control in the administrative field of Armiñón (Alava).
The authorities are stopping a van in which the two of them travel, and passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of abdominal, was not visible at the same time.
The detectives have taken the passengers into custody, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested, and identified as A. A. J. - reported by the Basque government Homeland Department.
The captured man is accused of drug trafficking and criminal assault.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the staff of the Álavai Forgalmi Inspectorate carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas and then left the inspection site.
The detectives took him into pursuit, then the vehicle stopped at a stopway a few miles away, and his passengers ran from the highway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily brand truck, he booked a shipment of 2178 kilograms of hash.
The abdominal rooms filled with the rear part of the vehicle were transported to the police to investigate more thoroughly and to measure the drug.
In addition, the verification showed that the false registration plate of the vehicle does not match the particulars contained in the van's papers, and therefore the arrestee is also subject to proceedings because of a misdemeanor.
The Basque Regional Police Department will continue the investigation aimed at arresting the other suspect who, as we have already mentioned, escaped the motorway and, on the other hand, the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations and then court proceedings began within a few hours.
She was arrested by Heather Lockler because she was driving under the influence of the medicine.
She arrested the police in Santa Barbara (Clifornia) this weekend, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, because she was under the influence of the drug.
According to an eyewitness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito - said one of the spokespersons of the People magazine's traffic surveillance in California.
According to the witness, around 16 o’clock at 30 p.m., he pushed the gas to the ceiling, bloated the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in the front and back, and he went through the sunglasses several times in the back.
Shortly later, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby motorway and get out of the car.
He also alerted the police because he “was concerned about Lockler’s life ”
When the police arrived, the actress sat in his car, which partially paralyzed the traffic of the highway.
“It seemed like a smoke, so the patrols carried him to a drug and alcohol test in a specialised center.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperating and the alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded.
Lockleart was arrested and arrested under the influence of an unidentified drug. Around 19 hours ago, he was sent to the local prison, where he was released a few hours later.
Lockler came out of a sanatorium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls for the United Left Andalian Federation to deal with the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, U.S. Secretary General and the United Left's representative today stated that the regional Federation of the process will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sport Council of the Seville Local Government, Francisco Manuel Silva.
“In these things, I am far from federalist, and this case is certainly the authority of the Andanelian organization, ” Llamazares pointed out the way in which the party is to apply to the former member of the Sevilian City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that, in order to detect any irregularities that might have been committed by Silva, \"ability to understand\" should be borne in mind: \"In addition to being fully transparent about cases of this kind,
It added that part of the training is ‘the strict code of ethics for civil servants’.
“Majic blood – the formation of Garci epikus
The work by Benito Pérez Galdos, National Epizods, inspired José Luis Garci, who brought about the famous anti-France rise of the Spanishs in the Majusi blood, which, with its budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the largest production of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the human price and social analysis he had always performed in the work of the well - known novelist. Today, Garci told the audience of actors at the film show Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
More than two and a half hours of Majusi blood will be introduced on Friday in the cinemas, and will later be shown as the Telemadrid mini series for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of Galdos' literature, achieved this childhood dream of filming, thanks to Esperanza Aguirrre, because he commissioned Madrid Tartum three years ago to make a monument for the 200th anniversary of the Madrid events of May 2. Garci accepted the request on condition that the story was based on the National Epizos.
The 15 million budget was financed entirely by the Madrid Autonóm Content, and Garci had a special opportunity: he could present it with an early decoration and costume, “the disturbed Spaniards, who were wrongly standing with the wrong leader, because the fight for independence had put the country in huge deficit with the reign of Ferdinand VII, ” he said.
However, the director expressed his regret that he could not account for the budget of Alatriste or Goya's fantoms kicking over the Majusi blood. Therefore, he was forced to skip a few scenes from the script, which, as many other times - are noted together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So, the director of the re-starter applied to the usual work method, with the actors who started the tests before the shooting. Casting was not because Garci thought it was “a megalyser ” and because, as he said, “the directorship is part of the theatre and cinema to find out what is going on in the industry we work in ”
Several of his actors, such as Miguel Relán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not first enter the camera.
Garci - who is proud of four Oscars - believes that Spain is represented before the Hollywood Academy, namely, the Majusi blood, the Seven French pool table and one of the last blind sunflowers represents neither the young generation of the Spanish cinema, “where it should be presented, ” said.
Garci with this movie doesn't count on charges.
“You think you’re working for the afterlife, and you realize that you’re only happy, and you’re happy when you’re ready to have another film, ” says Garci, who’s 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of Isabel Bayón, dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville makes me remember a woman who danced in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, born in Triana and moved to London with her parents when she was three years old, from the father of the Catalan Father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of the Annallite (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela).
He was an artist of the free dance and an expert at the Eastern Dances.
During his moving life, he fought as a pioneer for female equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Wollf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddha and a vegetarian and was fighting against wearing a woman’s freedom of movement.
The dance and aesthetic revolution broke out in war in Europe, and his life was flooded by Isabel Bayon.
“Beupa Gamboa and I wanted to work, she suggested to me Tortola, whose personality really impressed me, ”
The Flamenco dancer said: “It is not our intention to tell his life story, but to take hold of his spirit.
The titles of his dances were made up of flamenco styles.
For example, on “a cloud of dancing, ” the tango is about guajira or“ a snake’s dance. ”
“It’s inspired, ” she says, “and it’s my style.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, after the Open door, sings again at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, exceptionally wanted to work together with a former disciple.
“Matilde forms the older Toorto, the mature woman.
I’m glad you said yes to my invitation, it’s very honorable to perform in my play,
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga music directors and guitarists Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Páaro’s bat, Rafa El Viola, and Juanfra Juárez, who “plays a permanent character that keeps on drawing up the real design ”
The piece also represents the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and is also in the far-reaching places at the time, including India, the United States or Italy.
“ I wanted to make a memory for her because her personality had a great influence on her own age, but now she is no longer known and even less appreciated her work, ” says Bayón.
The performance begins at 20 a.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre tonight.
At the end of Triennium, the journal of a newly married poet will appear
The first illustrated edition of a newly married poet's journal will be presented in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia. The presentation is part of the programme series entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Andalúz Regional Government Cultural Commission on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Irodalian Nobel Prize and the anniversary of the two deaths.
Thus, the final stage of this work was re-examined by Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize poet's memorial house, and the exhibition “Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree. This year, the exhibition opened a series of Annallian provinces and planned to visit New York for the time of the International Congress.
A total of eight hundred copies of the Andalúz Regional Government's Cultural Commission have been obtained from the journal of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the fame and work of one of the most versatile poets of the Annalös.
Without Paul Newman, it's not that attractive to America.
“God sometimes gives perfect people a room.
Paul Newman was like that, too.
The quote comes from actress Sally Field who was working with Newman in Newman, the victims of sensation, and reflects the shock and inability caused by Newman's death in the American cinema and caused all of America.
How hard it is to get the Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
and was known to have been sick,
Even so, his death has fueled everyone.
“Even though it is impossible to express our feelings, and I have now lost a good friend, ” said Robert Redford, “his life has made my life better, and this country, ”
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or overdoing.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went out in a particularly dark period, shadowed by the desperate search for terrorism and market relations, the American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times go on and many people easily lose their virtues and are very few people we can look up to, then we don't have to be Luis Cernada to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men, he created the prospect of pilgrims of beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a protector of lost and won cases, starting with the anti-drug foundation set up for the memory of the firstborn son who died in drug overdose until the creation of his home-made bio-food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was hard to overcome by its suicidal nutrition culture.
The enchanting wonder wave entered all Hollywood without regard for nationalities and origins.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, says it's not a man, it's a time of death.
Another English, Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, said that his joint work with Newton was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy from Australia, called Newman straight to his greatest inspiration.
“ George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who today is trying to follow Paul Newman’s way of life, requires honesty and private life away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the middle of today's media jungle.
There's still someone trying, and Paul Newman is his role model.
Once divorced, but after 50 years of faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward, he would have had many occasions of unfaithfulness.
“ Why I eat burgers elsewhere if the roasted meat is at home, it’s funny.
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not common in America.
“ None of these forms were as proud as a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted human friend, ” he says.
The broken path of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us have dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012 Olympics have failed, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking if we're really prepared for it?
Because if we leave yesterday's race, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect competition, but my idea is that it was the worst of all that I've ever been.
It was characterized by a block of senses, and if it were to be evaluated, and I'd be the examiner, it would be a clear failure.
But let's move on and start at the beginning.
The misunderstandings began by taking over the serial number, because it was necessary to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at once (including chips, to avoid job later).
Well, that's not what happened.
First, only the serial number was passed (first nonsense, only to go earlier) and (after the usual job), as surprising as it was only T-shirt S (second nonsense, because I have an XL in size).
What kind of world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they decided to save money and buy only cheaper, cheaper shirts?
But anyway, these things are still going to be destroyed compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to take the chip at an awful early stage, the position in line took 15 minutes from arrival, and even the backpack had to be dropped.
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, which is unclear in the case of a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the competition started, and we haven't dropped the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made it even more pleasant for more than 40 minutes of waiting to be revised by attempts at pop-up and stand-up.
I think we'll get about 500 Pneumonia by tomorrow, and some, including myself, not with our actual time.
If they asked me about the perfect race, I wouldn't think of that.
So I think we can keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic town.
Microsoft (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT upcoming Technology Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence which, however, is capable of doing some basic tasks. For example, Microsoft can call a taxi (or, for Microsoft, a vehicle in the company's territory) on the basis of the information heard from the conversation.
This ‘receptive’ system enables a camera and a format and facial recognition system to recognize how many people in the room are, who are, and indeed remember what they wear - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
In addition, he can group the people present on the basis of the discussions.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she is not part of the company talking to him or that she is not the employee of the company.
He asks if he'd come to visit someone and make sure he'd be in a hurry to help him soon.
All this without the blue screen.
It's amazing.
But that is, of course, the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things to do, for example, to improve the new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people say that this week was a new Microsoft strategy.
Windows will be 7 smaller and contain fewer by-products.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers only run the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, then the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
Spanish wax has been invented, given that Microsoft has added features and extras to Windows so far in every new version.
Change of direction will be restored.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming increasingly needed in the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome showed up on the web, I joined the theory that Google made the first move to make Windows competitors.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as an essential element in the dialogue between hardware and software is essential.
He's doing the same thing as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it will have to be accounted for with the death of the operating system, not absolute, but relative.
This week's statement by Ballmer confirms this thought.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system and more and more attention to web browsers.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more of the time spent browsing than we spend in the window world.
What is a large part of the applications with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 is less, there's got to be a lot less than Vista.
Less difficult, less stressed, less complicated.
The purpose of Microsoft is to integrate its services on-line and to finally report an alternative to Google.
All they need is an example of why.
I made this photo in Redmond at the beginning of the month in a society for Microsoft professionals.
The soda machine calls them a poster, uses the company's browser. - Your browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft editors used Google for online browsing.
By the way, last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been announced to slide.
Not at the beginning of 2009, it will arrive at the end, even in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to throw it into the Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
At the end of the day, the mobile phone is increasingly operating as a computer.
But the slides, given that the Android and iPhone are already on the market, will certainly ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore this in the diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in the Christian Cross of Francis Ford Coppola, and this is also one of the basics of a well-made gay public.
And if we are already on the list of specialities, we may recall the peaceful figure of the archoric archeologist of the mustache.
What are we talking about?
Which means \"tank\", as the English lips call it, but none of the competitions with the Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of the elegant name, although they only refer to him as \"Marcel\" as the sport, the legend says that Marcel Cerdan was named by the singer of Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex customization, special emblem and a small Belgian flag are also found among his competitors. This is the most typical models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company isn't just making a tank of tops.
The athletes, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, seaweeds, baby clothes, mini series - and we could still list all of the company's products.
And they're all part of the comfortable underwear category,
Even though it is unfortunate that they are to be worn underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I would love to be a young mother; no matter who the father is, ” he says.
He is very similar to his brother, but he was able to achieve himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
At present, Cruz sisters want to play a more important role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling is much more than giving some pretty and pretty girls their name.
He was present at the promotion of the new Paris headquarters of Mango and the handover of the most prestigious fashion prizes Sponsored by the Spanish company.
There's heat and gentleness coming from it.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present the new autumn and winter collection of Mango, which was designed by my brother, Penelope, and we participate in the publication of the second tender of Mango Fashion Awards and the galavacs held in Opera for Valentino's respect.
It's a pretty busy day, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at the Mango Company.
We both love the movie of the '50s and '60s; we've taken a lot of things from there.
And then, often I just walk into town and listen to the women, how they dress, how they change and pick up their clothes - that's one of my favorite times.
You work as a dancer, an actress and a fashion designer.
That's what I think, but in the end, these three things are related because they have a lot in common.
When I was a kid, I was looking forward to going to my grandmother's, and I was sitting in my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you in Khana, he almost got up with a theme park.
And then, as a dancer, I've always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style of clocks and rehearsals so we can have a good time looking in the mirror.
And in your role as an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's all connected to everything, and all due respect to designers and their expertise.
You've been celebrating your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than I've ever liked the '30s.
I think women are really worth it, they've experienced enough, and they've made less mistakes in life.
And I'm not worried about the biological clock.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I feel about it, and I've had a lot of internal happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother, because I was born as a woman for this, and I really don't want to be a young mother, so I don't want to miss it.
As far as the future father is concerned, no matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and in love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie last year, you've filmed a lot of movies they haven't even shown.
Yeah, and I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm the one who started at the theater, very patient and restless, and I want everything right away, but of course I know it's impossible.
I can't wait to see the last hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you're gonna say to them...
I know you've been decorating on the runway with Naomi Campbell for a few days.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to London for a charity show, which she had arranged for her own organisation called a better world. I chose two of my own Mango collections.
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
There's so much they're putting together about it, so I know it, and I can make sure that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the right side of his activity.
He asked me for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'll do it.
If women in the third world make their bets, I don't know what's impossible.
Falling drunk drivers will be obliged to install ‘Alcolock’
The Ministry of Home Affairs would require the car to be fitted to a structure that would prevent the vehicle from starting when the driver is drunk or does not blow into the structure when it is in three drunk driving conditions.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will take a year.
As the aim of the project is to restore to the market, the driver will also have to take part in a repeated course on driving.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute for Road Safety (FITSA), it is also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of the drivers arrested for multiple driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, because the system connected to the vehicle will determine the alcohol level of the air sprayed in. If it is higher than permitted, or if the driver doesn't put it in the device at all, the system will not allow the car to be started.
The cost of an instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be for the offender.
A study in the United States of 2007 in this regard has shown that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people per year could be saved by this rule.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: it is easier to prevent crime from being committed,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce as the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the ordinary medium, while the necessary criminal reform requires a basic legislative amendment.
The instrument on the Spanish market is not yet available in any commercial form, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The Assembly will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party - a French model - to include the system in school buses.
In Mexico, in locked shoes
At the time announced in the program, he landed at the President's Hangar at Benito Juárez Airport at 17 o'clock at 40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force Prince Party of Asturias.
The sun was already down, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal couple leaving the plane using our hands as eyeballs.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other high-ranking personalities.
A few hours before I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Duchess were coming to the city for official visits.
Well, then for a while now there's no airport transfer... the woman from here or something.
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, she's just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or so...
But in the Mexican press, that knows everything about the Prince Party of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
A lot of people are waiting for the red carpet of the airport hangar, the temple created by the 27 sailors who protect the dignity.
The Prince shows up with a smile, a sea blue dress, and then the Princess gets the wind in her long hair, holding back clothes, but not in the usual toe-to-toe shoes - may have been warned that Mexico City is threatened by storm.
They stop for a second and smile at the cameras and then enter the room where the official reception comes.
In their hotel gate - which is one of the four largest hotels in the city - there is a reporter of a saucer on Mexican television.
The most valuable fashion fee
The world's most suitable place to give a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and today's fashion designers are the most sophisticated and most fortunately Valentino.
Mango recently announced El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards' second proposal to promote the international expertise of young talents in fashion.
The Grand Prix is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the first competition for the Belgian winner of the Paris boulevard Haussmann, saw his own design clothes in Mango's box under 54, and he was slightly relieved of his influence.
By the way, this is the company's second largest European business and has just been opened at 1335 square meters.
The biggest deal is in London.
In the middle of the outstanding events, as well as the demonstrations for Valentino - the jury president - we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner in Garnier Opera in Paris.
In Chagalok's most beautiful company, the President's table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, who, because of her recent death, came with a hard heart and sorrow, wore one of the company's pieces and ELAH's few breathtaking jewels, accompanied Valentin to the main table of dinner for her respect, with a son named Luis nearly two metres high.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, had fun with the guests. Rotchil and the bar were so knightic at the university that they eventually stayed without a suit because they were both given to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own design pants and shirt, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At the night's opera visit, Gaya Toledo got so excited in the ballet room that she had an old time-sitting into one of the bars and a grand plie.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but before that, he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we could enjoy Oliver Martinez - he'd be two meters tall and motor - and John Travolta also arrived at the Paris Interclinen with his own sheets and towels, and he'd say he didn't want any smell in the room.
Stars under Paris' star ego.
Oh là là, c'est la.
1001 The stress absorber number
It's not 1,000, it's 1,000 and there's one way to turn off the chaotic and messy everydays.
Further good news is that we can find them all in one book coming to the bookstore on 30 September to bring peace with us.
It's almost embarrassing at 7:00 in the morning, but it's even worse to think about how accelerated life is forced by the world today.
The office's name is tension, and the computer's back pain.
The stress is the public disease of the 21st century.
But there is not one and not two ways to overcome daily fatigue and overcome problems at work.
No, this number is exactly 1001.
In his book Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in Yoga positions, in addition to classic massages or \"spa\" treatments, so that everyone can find a solution that can be adjusted to the most comfortable and free minutes.
The stress resolution work bears the title of the 1001 relaxation method and the flooding rest of it comes from the Pearson Alhambra y DK publisher to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly cool it down in his faith.
In fact, it also serves with other ideas that help us all to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make up to 100% natural foods.
If you're too low to refresh your adrenaline body and your stress life has become a central problem, it's time to stay in the chair, relax and focus on reading.
People who speak in dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not thinking about those who get upset and tell themselves all about what happened to them that day, but about those who talk during sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it's actually completely harmless.
This kind of sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It's quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure they've been told more that he was talking at night.
Its frequency may be entirely rhesodical (for example, once in a case of a severe fever) or more regular (week, weekly or monthly) and the child usually does not remember anything the next day.
The appearance cannot be derived from one trigger.
Often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night dilations, night-night bed beds (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not lawful.
As mentioned above, a condition with a high fever, or even an accompanying situation in a stressful situation, or an upheaval condition.
In any case, it has been a little studied.
The intensity of the speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, it may be associated with words, Mormoise, but unlike these, it may also be expressed in the form of screaming, crying, or a longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and the professional. The examination may reveal that there is no problem of a great anxiety in the background, and therefore can provide a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a good phenomenon, therefore there is no cure, unless the sleep disorder is accompanied by another manageable form (e.g. insomnia or stress).
But there are some things we can do, and here is a pre-coup action:
Note that the child remains calm before bed.
Choose reassuring games and avoid watching children with fearful or aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or having a difficult time, we will teach them some relaxation methods to find inner rest more easily.
This will help the child sleep more calmly.
Still, if you start talking while you're asleep, let's try to maintain your rest.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child up.
It wouldn't matter because the kid isn't aware of it, but he'd get out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if there is frequent anxiety, it is advisable to turn to a professional or to reveal what causes the child to get a high degree of anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start asking questions to find out anything about it.
It would be unnecessary, because when you're asleep, it's not so conscious that you can get your mind together.
On the other hand, you just hear the speech, but you don't see the dream images associated with it, so be careful to interpret the hearings and draw any conclusions.
Never tell the child they can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally straight to the Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new boost and won again on the domestic course.
Although there was no fiery game, the yellow-blacks were repeatedly put in a position where one of them could finally win by using one.
The speed of the match was not too tight because the attackers were having trouble feeling the right rhythm.
The first goal was shot by the guest team captain Kauffmann, but the remote ball had just touched the upper corner of the gate. Then Illhaeusern was taken over and followed each other by the shots: Fonderflick tried a distant shot, then Hirn was shot over the gate. Romain spámal, Diebold also tried to play with a distant attempt to protect Dannemarie.
On the other side, players were protected in a block on the middle track and only the heir Riahi was in shooting position.
The beginning of the second half-time promised to be crucial: first, Riahi and Temporale were put in position on the side of Dannemarie. Next, he was born in the first goal: after Diebold's first shot, he received the ball with the excellent placement of the eveninguerni Marais and then sent it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern’s goalmaker could not have enjoyed the glory for a long time: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the struggle in a man’s direction.
The Dannemarie, however, was unable to take advantage of the advantage: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little bit to confirm their protection.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will put an exit to Bretagne.
On Monday, the demonstration by fishermen affected the traffic of several bretons and Normann ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit Le Guilvinec, Finistère, on Tuesday morning, to meet the representatives of the protestors.
The latter promised to accept the President in “constructive spirit, ” expressing their hopes that Sarkozy would come with specific suggestions.
The President's visit is in line with the meeting of the \"Republic Committee\" set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rise in the price of gas oil, as the oil price exceeded the average price of the EUR 1,14 per litre record.
David Martinon, the President of the Republic, says that the President will discuss this with fishermen what ways to help companies recover their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers.
The fishermen are determined to await Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
On Tuesday morning, traffic slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados County, with which some 10 km [10 km] of congestion occurred.
They also paralysed the traffic of Quiberon's yacht link, but the roads to Belle-île were not closed.
Road tunnels were placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already witnessed their determination. Then in the morning, tyres and pallets were set up before the fuel warehouses of Bresti ports, while demonstrations were carried out in Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic coast and La Manche. In the Vendée County Sables d'Olonne, for example, fishermen did not board a ship while around 20 vessels in Le Havre prevented commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, located in Loire-Atlantique County, have removed the huge Total oil refining block in Donges.
On the other hand, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held at the Ministry by deciding on further steps.
Le Guilvinec should decide on Tuesday on his next move and participation at the meeting planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the national fisheries committee, as the committee did not support their efforts.
“The strike continues, ” said the President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, “for example, as fishermen do not allow their claims and are not willing to travel to Paris.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes for gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents for litres, but they think that the operation of a vessel would only be profitable if the price of gas oil fell to EUR 0,30 per litre.

More than 15% of AIG's assets would be sold
The American International Group, which has been set up by American financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay the advance $85 billion - has announced the cost of the Financial Times’s Dominicans.
In addition to the life insurance and US pension insurance activities at international level, AIG would be responsible for a large part of almost all other businesses - the newspaper, which quoted funds close to the case.
According to the Times, the board of directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to examine sales options.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The asset stock that AIG wants to sell includes the International Lease Financial Corp airline, the shares of the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company 59%, as well as the real estate portfolio and private capital investments - are added by the Times.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision yet on sales.
AIG has to get liquid assets quickly to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, thereby taking over the risk of becoming up to 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders accordingly.
A study by Paris Historique on the Morning Meeting of the History of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which has never seen nearly 800 exact reductions), and Nasdaq was 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) sank at 777,68 points, so closed at 10 365,45 points.
The biggest fall in the index so far (684,81 exact) was registered on 17 September 2001 when the trade started again after the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Nasdaq 199,61 based mainly on technology papers was closed at 1,983,73 points, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index decreased by 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1, 106,55 points according to official closure data.
The Wall Street stock exchange was already weakened when it opened, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the market balance bank rescue plan, it started to fly deep.
The representatives rejected the funds requested by the Minister for Finance, Henry Paulson, by 228 votes to 205.
The plan was taken down by nearly two-thirds of the Republicans.
“This market has broken down the wrong signals, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan, ” considers Lindsey Piegza, an analyst for FTN Financial.
“It seems that the market was expecting this plan, ” he added, and he expressed his concern about the fact that if a plan like this were adopted a few days later, it would be “too late. ”
“If the plan is really doomed to death, ” warns Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight, head of the public, Brian Bethune.
To increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “A new and new financial institution is failing every day, in the United States.
After Washington Mutual's Friday bankruptcy, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's bank branches were bought by his rival, the Citigroup.
The crisis in Europe has suddenly accelerated, which has required urgent measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux states, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has “not only a US crisis but also a global crisis, ” adding the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has been significantly weakened.
The 10-year government bond yield fell from 3.827% to 3.662% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.161%.
Obama won the first television match
The first debate of the two American presidential candidates followed another one, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the match.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and the members of the Democratic campaign said to themselves the victory in the television parlour followed by one third of American households.
According to a political analyst by David Gergen, although John McCain's action was honorable, it did not prove to be impressive enough to stop the loss of popularity: this is demonstrated by surveys carried out five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the opinion poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage vis-à-vis McCain (44% and 49%).
According to 39% of the surveyees who are most counting, Obama will win, while 25% of them expect McCain to win according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his partner Joseph Biden's excellent Thursday role. Biden's first and only public debate with Sarah Palin.
However, Bill Clinton warned us this weekend: “It would be hard to underestimate Palin.
He's got a good feeling about it.
McCain, who lives in his 70 ’ s, never fails to put his own, undisputed foreign policy experience in advance. However, he stresses his opposition to “women, ” on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
“It seems that Senator Obama does not understand that, ” said the attack several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge of the presidential position, ” said McCain.
This is the main attack area, which has been used by Republican television ads since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represented the future.
He wouldn't let himself be disturbed. He'd come together and put it exactly.
He stressed the ability to make good decisions and to restore the picture of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, however, Obama has already cut back on this weekend-radiod democratic ad that puts it in the eyes of the Republican leader that he still did not assess the impact of the crisis on the American “new people. ”
“In ninety minutes John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you said yesterday before 20 thousand people from Obama who gathered in the rain in North Carolina for the election meeting.
Even the words “middles, ” or“ workers, ” were not put out on the mouth. The confused situation in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, who the Americans think is the most suitable to save the economy on the edge of the collapse.
\"The next week may prove to be a turning point,\" said Charles Schumer, the influential senator.
Rahm Emanuel's Democratic Representative, one of the vets of the Clinton Government, has excellent incentives in the field of Obama's economy, such as Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In view of the Democratic President-in-Office, the current crisis is \"the final judgment over the bad economic policy of eight years created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain\".
Senator Illinois reaffirmed that despite stock exchange fluctuations, he would be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans, and added that among his primary objectives it would include the creation of energy independence of the country through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to set up 45 nuclear plants by 2030.
However, both candidates carefully avoided the issues related to the bank rescue plan of $700 billion (€470 billion): the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: “The first thing they noticed was that there was an election.
Young people and opponents were protesting on Sunday night at the capital of Belarus to reject the expected result of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday night, after the closing of the polls, hundreds of Belarus gathered in Minsk square to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young people protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko by saying: “Diktator, give up. ”
Some admit that they didn’t even go to vote: “What would I have done? They’re doing what they want with my vote, ” says a young person.
The protestors do not believe that the regime, which tried to make a good signal to foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, would be prepared to change a democratic system.
If the observers were to judge the elections, they would be able to eliminate sanctions against the country, under which 40 Belarusian leaders refused visas and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections were not clear.
“We were held by the election committees, and our observers could not attend the vote counting, ” said Jurij Potyemkin, organized from the twelve parties, so spokesperson of the highly heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition.
“The changes were only nominal – stressing Mr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the head of the pro-European movement. “The point is who is counting the votes and, in our case, this executive power.
If the opposition's delegates get into Parliament, it means they've been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament allows them to get a seat on television, to be able to meet in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore act in political life, because \"a dialogue with the European Union must be initiated\".
Because if our highly-funded economy vis-à-vis Russia is in crisis and we are not able to renew, we are risking being put under Russia's control.
But we want to be independent.
The opposition is afraid that the outcome of the vote will be accepted by the European Security and Cooperation Organisation monitoring the election process.
It is stressed that the participation rate appears to be too high and that there was any manipulation of the broad organisation of the prior vote (which 26% of voters participated in Minsk).
“The President noticed that the election had taken place here, ” he asked, the Social Democratic Head of Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released from prison in August and August last, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polls.
And the Parliament will have up to five opposition Members, and those who are most in line with leadership.
The silence of the night will go back to October.
President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee are pleased to succeed.
Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated his tenth anniversary yesterday. President Francine Décary had a good reason for celebrating because Hema-Québec today became one of the world's safest and most effective blood- givenrs.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people's trust, which was seriously affected by the scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, national blood reserves treated by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply have been infected with acquired immune deficiency symptoms (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general revolution, the Canadian government launched an official investigation under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, which was designed to shed light on the circumstances that led to tragedy and to put forward proposals to avoid similar events in the future.
While Judge Krever has submitted his late report, some provinces have established their own committees with the aim of designing a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee carried out this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports have led to two blood supply services in Canada: one is Hema-Québec, the other is responsible for all other provinces and the two territories.
“When Hema-Québec started its activities in 1998, people had less than 38% confidence in Quebec’s blood supply system, ” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was doubtful.
“In the coming years, however, we managed to recover people’s trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, ” Décary proudly states that, at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population in Quebec already considered Hema-Quebece to be reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that “the trust is an extremely fragile thing ”
It has applied the precautionary principle since its establishment in Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe when the infant’s disease, that is, Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, has infected people, says the doctor who has been running the company since its founding in 1998.
“We had no idea whether this disease spreads through the blood.
Therefore, we have relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports. On this basis, if we are uncertain and are at risk of developing serious disease, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which causes brain changes and thus inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, no doubt was found that the disease spreads through the blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle,
In 1999, a technology published on the market that makes the HIV virus more sensitive to diagnosing. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT) that is directly able to detect the virus in the blood of blood donors and not the antibodies to which the virus was used.
Using the NAT test, we could shorten the window cycle, which lasts from infection until the virus can be detected in the blood using our technical tools - explains the expert.
This period could be reduced to a shorter period than one week.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk that blood clots would infect blood and that this could not be detected.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of the spread of AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
“In other words, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products as long as someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Because Hema-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products each year, it should take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and for some to be infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that anyone can accept it now or write a blood transfusion to restore health - sets out Hema-Québec's number one leader.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what a new pathogen is getting into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we need to keep on being afloat, Dr. Décary, and she stressed that Hema-Québec had to provide sufficient permanent reserves in addition to emergency supplies.
“As the population ages, demand is also growing.
Since anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the stock of blood donors, as the number of people in the network who can donate blood represents only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, any healthy person, at least 18 years old, who fulfils the eligibility criteria, can have blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed do not qualify for blood transfusion for one year.
“With this 3%, we have enough reserves to meet hospital needs.
It's very rare we're out of stock.
But we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones are older, because they can't give blood after a while.
However, people are very difficult to convince to give blood, but it is even harder to keep them and make them become regular donors of blood.
In this world of running around today, man barely has an hour to go out and give blood, ” lament Francine Décary.
Hema-Québec, an annual budget of $297 million, provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and leather tissue, which are used for almost exclusively seriously burned persons.
These tissues are analysed, converted and frozen, then placed at Hema-Québec, which also manages a single public stem cell bank.
It is only the cord that is treated as medical waste that can be obtained with blood that is rich in stem cells, so it can also be treated with serious diseases (such as leukemia).
\"Some weeks ago, we celebrated the fact that we have been in our bank for the thousandth time, we are planning to take out more than a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of next year, we are probably about to start offering these for organ transplants,\" Dr. Décary explained, who said that the nebula blood recovery program is very popular these days.
“It is true that many mothers are sad about this because, because Hema-Québec does not have the option of making this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - In the semifinal of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounderst on USL-1 yesterday, and got into the semifinal with the combined result 4:3. This was the second final and crucial match for the total results, which took place in Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was played by Antonio Ribeiro's middle courtman who won the match in 90 minutes.
While the first half-time went without goal, the second was the two mid-fields of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino found in the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque was the only one from Sounders' team who managed to play Matt Jordan.
Remember, on Friday's first match, Impact 2:1 suffered defeat from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, out of Seattle.
The Impact plays in the pre-final with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which got out of Whitecaps by 3:1, won 4:3, but still reached the closing room with the combined result of 5:4 Whitecaps.
Imact is expected to meet with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the match are still clarified today.
Diohej - Kovalev’s winning goal
The Canadians' favorite triage is waiting for the new season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and finally, the Canadiens won Florida Panthers in 3:2 of the crime scenes last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first number of meetings star got a gole. Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the match with a goal pass, which was the fourth win from the six preparation games of the team.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who obtained the only goal of the shooting.
\"I'm not even ready,\" warns the Russian player.
\"I have another game to feel real,\"
“He tried to get too much out of himself in the first third, ” noted Guy Carbonneau.
\"But I think the outcome of the game was happy.
He's got a huge innovation.
North Charest's Efforts
The Prime Minister does not rule that the election will begin this year.
The Liberal Party meeting had hardly ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (left) was going to win in the interim election to be held today.
“Simplify our last great northern border: this ambitious long-term goal was formulated by Jean Charest at the meeting of the Liberal Party in Brussels yesterday. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to focus on the issue.
During his presentation, he was behind his back, drawing pictures like ‘Moulin à images’.
On the three huge screens they followed each other: water power dams, mining, Quebec on the \"Google Maps\", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to guarantee that the election would not start this fall, although he added that his time schedule was very tight.
By the fourth pillar of the plan, the vision of the Government's future of Quebec, a new economic area, includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of agreements planned by Ontrio.
In recent times, opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at the 49th degree) was often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never spoken on this subject before.
The Prime Minister, however, was merely trying to explain why he considered North to be a treasure mine full of enormous opportunities, did not talk about the timer, the investment sums, or the specific order of importance for future projects.
It only highlighted a few opportunities for development: mainly water plants, forestry, and especially mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
It is located in the north, in nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.
This area, which is “two times the size of France, ” is our territory, Quebec.
Not only in us, but also in us, he repeated the Prime Minister of State, stressing his desire to create a national founder.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely defined by the relationship with the North: the gold fever in Abitib, the Québec design work, the James Bay...
“ This is our future, ” he said, after having a stage break, he saw a huge map behind his back.
North of Quebec, which is about 70% of its territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself - the Prime Minister has announced at the press conference.
“This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there is no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government.
On the other hand, “in the light of climate change we have to rethink our approach to the North, ” said the Prime Minister, on the north-west passage, which opens every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the opinion of the Prime Minister, the reservation of the area in this new geopolitical environment is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would pay particular attention to them and will benefit from the plan, especially for young people.
The two ministers of the different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau, who had recently been ungavai of Parti Québécois, had already begun the consultation with about thirty local communities.
Benoît Pelletier also led the Interministerial Committee, in which Julie Boulet (Ministry of Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large meeting, not necessarily a summit, where they ‘ set common vision’.
The North would otherwise be developed in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated, and environmentally friendly – promised by the Prime Minister.
Jean Charest described this “wisp ” as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers before him.
\"In addition to former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges –
This was one of the returning topics of the weekend that started with the great cocktail party that held the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election to the party.
One of the decisions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be crossed into the Adélard-Godbout barrier.
“Our politicians, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Quebece, the quiet revolution and Lesage, who carried out the national distribution of water power plants, or Boursa, known as the Father of James Bay, all knew how to build the future, ” said Jean Charest.
He also quoted another - true, conservative work at the press conference, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister Roads to the North between 1957 and 1963.
Regarding the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper power plant, President Charest stressed that it was planned to be installed by 2012.
“ This remains between us, but I plan to be there, ” she said, “and she accepted her statement as loud as a clapsvihar.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there will be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote in the autumn of this year, which the law will allow him to vote.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was already full of work, as he took up his duties at the Federal Council meeting in China and at the Québec-New York Summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week for the Liberal President proved to be an excellent platform for the development of nationalist decisions, which was almost unthinkingly approved. This is particularly about the ‘objectives’: the Liberal Party, in particular, demands the special nature of Quebec, to be recognised in the Constitution.
I also want Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and these members would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
On the other hand, the opposition septically accepted the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, has re-introduced the development policy of North Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, in 2003, the Liberal Government powered to reject the application of this policy.
If you hadn't done so, we would have been much ahead of us, in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was the candidate for the vote in Jean-Talon today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
“ However, we would like this to be not just a play, ” noted leader of Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A Enchanted Country
In the summer of last year, Vic Toews, the Minister of Harper's Office (also the Minister for Justice), took the courage to call Louise Arbout Canada.
So to despise a woman who has fought for justice and deserves all of our appreciation - this tells us a great deal about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, one of the western countries concerned, who has not delivered home its own citizen from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is the government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time he committed crimes.
This is the only government that, despite the signing by Canada of the Geneva Convention, refused its word and allowed a child soldiers to smite under inhumane conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet show about justice while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, the association of Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers is also demanding the return of Omar Khadr to Canada for a fair trial.
And our government has turned a blind eye over the cake: it does not matter to him that a young adult has already been completely ruined and that many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, there is currently an indemnity of our rights, freedoms and democracy. “Democracy: Harper is a constant expression of this word, which sounds merely empty from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morals: they can abuse, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen according to the comfort of a government leader who has so far become a minority (and what can come after 14 October...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that praises the Power, the Law, and the Order. They cannot see that this government is stifling the values of the good news and dignity of our country.
Dear Toews, the shame is to look for it - not anywhere else.
Review - The Barrick Gold Orwell speech desk
In Le Devoir's September 17th issue, a letter was published from Patrick J. Garver, deputy president of the Canadian Barrick Gold mine.
Mr Garver, following his remarks, states that the world's largest gold-producing company has launched a six million-dollar vignette trial against three authors and a small-scale publishing company in order to start a “public debate. ”
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decisions are taken, especially in matrimony proceedings, not by the truth, but by the law.
It's not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way for you to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to it?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts of money on defence and fighting in an uneven fight where on the other hand, there is a force of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible resources from the mining industry.
In such an uneven fight, however, they often use the tactics of destroying the defendant and making a friendly agreement that not only silences the opposite, but also scares those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public.
Although this is not the case in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, it is not the case in Canada, but in Canada.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have highlighted the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public, and with a move, he rejects the applications and letters written in defense of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how to initiate a ‘ public’ debate if he ignores the opinion of the public at the same time?
In the Vice-President's head, this word is probably merely about bus-payed lawyers, not about Canada: the meaning of the concept is narrowed.
In a democratic state, freedom of speech applies even to those who evaporate others.
But Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because it condemns the harsh procedure of the mine.
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and to give judgment, but on the basis of civilised arguments, rather than by means of an appeal to many. (As regards the expression ‘a public debate’, Barrick Gold recently called in writing the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal thinking, Barrick Gold's procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are building blocks of all democratic society.
In all of this, it denies the right to quote credible resources, to have a debate on facts and interpretation, which are the basis of spiritual activities.
If in a country like Canada you can only study and discuss issues that do not like rich companies in today’s world, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, he could do this according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer that.
In our university circle, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences of view and conflicts for a long time.
In contrast to his claim, Barrick Gold has no interest in having an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the Canadian institution of public debates. It is time for governments to put in place measures that limit the legal procedures for such abuse.
Rescue on Wall Street - The Democrats and Republicans agreed
The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Bush Government and Congress finally reached agreement on an economic rescue mission yesterday, which has been the greatest standard of such a plan since the great economic crisis in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to contain the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved for the two houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan: more effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the foreseen public money; new provisions to keep the number of houses booked because of the absence of payments; access to the payment of managers of the beneficiary companies.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Parliament, and Judd Gregg, the Republican representative who attended the trial yesterday, announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day trial in marathon.
“We have made great progress towards a solution that will operate effectively on the markets, ” said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush government.
“We have done everything we can to save the real economy and the American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street, ” explained the Democrats.
“The most important point is that if we don’t do this, there will be huge shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans,” said Judd Gregg Republican representative.
The negotiation was accelerated during the last few hours, fearing another failure would have an adverse effect on the atmosphere of investors.
The agreement was concluded before the stock exchange opened this morning.
The two presidential candidates who later joined the negotiations showed their willingness to reach an agreement, but they expressed themselves, and they are not happy that the situation has increased to the end.
Senator Barack Obama himself owned the extension of the agreement with elements such as the maintenance of the property or the payment of managers of companies assisted by the State.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps because of the irresponsible nature of other people, that is not too pleasant.
But these steps are necessary, he noted, in an American television show.
And when the opponent, John McCaint, asked another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied: “I would like to know the details, but I hope he is,
“What I have read in large lines is already seen as something that we all need to digest and move on.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable, he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy two claims from US financial institutions from their money, some sort of risk of unsoldible assets.
The plan was preceded by a crisis over 14 months, which was initiated by the derecognition of the real estate credit. This first led to a collapse of risky real estate loans (second mortgage loans) and then a spread to other debt-to-credit (trade) securities and, lastly, the freezing of liquid resources and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was failed by a group of Republican representatives last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain \"toxic\" tools of companies in difficulty should be guaranteed by the government rather than by the government.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, a provision has also been included in the plan which requires that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion instalment would be paid first; this will be followed by another $100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion in payments should be approved by the Congress with another vote.
In exchange for this assistance, Washington will obtain a share in the supported companies, which will make the profits a dividend, which will be sold after the crisis has been reduced.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the reservation of the mortgage loans covered by the plan, and may also adjust the maximum value of remuneration and disposal to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
I would like to see the plan voted in favour of the House today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Since yesterday the anti-plan statements were repeated, both among the Republicans and the Democrats.
“It is very clear that Washington does not hear your voice, ” said Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the House’s financial committee.
\"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is not one that would favour taxpayers,
Brad Sherman, a Democratic representative of the “septic group ” called the convention assembly, presents things differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
“Some hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel award scientists, have written to us to ask Congress: do not hurry up and look carefully at which route he chose, ” said Sherman yesterday.
At the same moment in Europe, it was once again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux States announced that they would state a part of the Fortis group in the value of EUR 11,2 billion (16,3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paris announced that it would not buy its competitors on the edge of bankruptcy after the EUR 2 million (US 2.9 billion) was lost as a result of the crisis in secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
With 85 thousand employees, Fortis is one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
\"This isn't the money that's dropped yesterday,\" said Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
\"We obtain voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is deemed uncertain –
Meanwhile, on the other hand, the British Government seems to be preparing to state a new bank that has been created by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which real estate loans account for £41 billion (U.S. $75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank, Santander, announced yesterday that they would buy subsidiaries and clienteles of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley, after this Northern Rock, would be the second bank that the British government has wanted to state since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Hello to the actor server
Some say the most important punch card in the eyes of the beautiful sarcasm, the most important weakness in others.
Have you ever been released from a female mirror by an American actor with a muddy smile?
Yeah, I didn't.
His shame, sensitivity, and congenital talent also left him away from the tight style of the true monstrous monuments of the art world.
But what a huge field he ran!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at 83 years old, on Friday, on Connecticut's estate, and he was one of the last icons of the flowering age in the American cinema.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who was like him, and who for a long time thought he was a rival on the film screen. He was more restrained and undoubtedly vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often results in exceptional children.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots have contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, which only increased his dignity.
In the early 1950s, Yale studied at the drama stage of Yale University and then in the New York Academy of Actor's, before it exploded into the theater, television and not long later on in the cinema.
Besides being a liveist in civil rights, he reached second place in 1979 on the 24-hour running of Le Mans. He was also considered a sexist, although he had been happily married to Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know the shadow sides of this mysterious, closed, professional life of an actor who hated the flash of show business.
He was a man of honesty, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the movie-crazys: we can only see in his big roles on the black screen of memories.
Looking at life, the seventh American art has been watching the cinema for over 50 years.
We recall that the young man who became admiring \"Butch Cassidy and Sundance\" (Scared Cowboya (1969) and his emotional wife (Elizabeth Taylor) was found in the Tensee Williams in 1958 as the \"Macska on the Hot Beetle\".
From the last few days (1990) we can remember in Mr. Bridge's sensitive image who faced old age with the fact that his marriage did not change his hopes.
Paul Newman also had a lot of other faces in his films.
In his film Robert Wise-Valaki upskirt, he performed an unforgivable work in the role of Rocky Graziano, a stormy criminal who was originally involved in the role of James Dean in 1956, who had been involved in his career as actress Newman after his death.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work “The Great Bahé, ” which won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen's genius film Svindler (1961) was a bitter, vindictive billionaire, and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorse's film entitled \"The Color of Money\". In 1987, he received a single Oscar award from nine markings.
Different times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by changes in age in metal.
The younger ones are mainly known for the cult film George Roy Hill, Icebreakers, (1977), where Reggie Dunlop is a coach of ice-flying methods.
Rajongos, however, saw the \"The Great Jump\" recorded by the Coen brothers in 1994.
The film Sam Mendes, “The Way of the Damage, ” closed in 2003, was the last one in the role of a Irish mafia chief.
Unlike a lot of cinemas that left the film screen relatively soon, Newman stayed in the reflectorlight for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with his sparkle, light and image.
Bertrand Tavernier’s French film director, not without all humor, considered “the underplay’s live cactus, ” to think that his game was too powerful.
However, his profession was not always good-looking with good-looking Paul Newman, who, for a long time, had just fallen into his lap.
Yet he has often played young and successful characters: rather, he has formed nervous, alcoholic, malignant, or hopeless figures living at the edge of society, whose drifting and rebellion have been given back with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face... a man with a real sense of insight and tenderness in his soul.
In the 1968 film Rachel Rachel, a wife of Margaret Laurence’s novel novel of Canada, and Joanne Woodward, a melancholy woman, was the main character of her performance.
The film “Harry and his son ” made in 1984, with restraint and sadness, reminds his son, Scott, who died in drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman’s countless admirer remembered the actor. A close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (with whom “The Great Struggle ” and “Butch Cassidy and Sundance played together) said in grief: “His life has made my life better and the world.
The joy of generosity and existence: this was the secret of the vibrating personality of this great actor, whom we have just lost.
In addition to legend's career, his comments on civil rights, the environment, the fight for independent film production and Hollywood's extremism are on the increase.
We've seen him smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods.
However, revenue from such sales has always been referred to as the foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his bakers: he's always committed to his profession.
In his five letters to his daughter, he wrote: “Your father has always been incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here,
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What were they producing in Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and their associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including crimes, which cause particularly significant damage to the criminal organisation and which are continued and commercially committed, including crimes.
According to the Public Prosecutors, the funds received were used for their own purposes and the tasks were often verified by unrealised accounts.
In general, public and municipal money, some 65 million forints, were moved to the Youth Left, partly to the pockets of some people.
The method presented by the investigating authority was that the funds received were taken on the basis of cost accounts behind which there was no real execution, and the associations never complied with the commitment.
The charges said most of the bills were false.
These were acquired on the capital market and were manufactured by Kiskuhalason.
And what would happen to companies in the name of the account production, including on the Balaton road to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his recent statement, he had to look like a baby and a restaurant.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, followed by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour wallet and the accounts to be submitted to the applications of the Capital Government.
In most of these, István Lados noted with his partner, Andrev Guard, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports needed to receive the aid.
One of his students in Lados’ study was a beer house.
According to the two accounts issued by the Zuschlagek in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for the ninety-person group of Commissioner Pont.
However, according to the CEO, there was no room for entry at the same time.
The same is true for the better Future - later together for the Third Year - the form and content of the account issued to the Foundation in the summer of 2002.
A pension from Badacsonytomaji was just three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in one night, yet the account was about a hundred and thirty guests.
However, imaginative printing performers were overstated even when they marked Pigal Kft., also for hospitality, which, according to the prosecution information, was not included in the documents on the name of the Right Future and Hoppa.
The head of the company, The Wolf's Győr, told hvg.hu that when they called the D.A. and presented him with bills, he immediately knew it was fake documents.
\"Our company's name and tax number are in the wrong spot on the stamp,\"
He added that, beyond the formal reasons, it was not the case that hundreds of people were housed according to the invoice, because they have a total of eleven rooms with no room.
In addition, the account was for food catering, while their restaurant was not working long ago.
The zealous bankers did not follow the fact that their travel agency, which looked at them, only organises foreign routes, so they marked botorul's travel in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not agree with the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as has been found during the investigation, VAT was included in the document, although travel activities to countries outside the European Union were VAT-free.
Among other things, VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the better Future, since the company's service was charged not by the specified 25, but by 15 per cent, while the hotel employees only issued a machine account, but the invoice produced was hand-held.
In addition, the invoice was damaged by the fact that, in the case of a company, road freight was marked as an activity by the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by the company based on investment advice.
In addition, it has also been found that the differences - an inadequate account format, not a real stamp - were false because the accounts for the Third Year Foundation, the XXIth century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are false.
Just like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunvainto Sports Camp, whose representatives have denied that they would have released the invoices.
For example, the forgers did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft, Nyíregyházi, had been liquidated at the time (2001) when he was eating a group for the Youth City Society, which is why the company's winding-up officer - according to our knowledge - has also denied that he would have issued the paper.
They made me known.
The other group of invoice holders is those who were aware of the need to issue a fiduciary account.
The Esély Budapest Foundation issued an invoice at the request of the Youth Left - Young Socialists for the Third Year Foundation for about four million HUF.
Collab Kft. leader - according to the prosecution - one of the defendants, György Ludovic, took him to release the fictional account.
He also cooperated with Zuschlagek on Biogate Kft., which in 2003 had issued the Right Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Walling Association with accounts for HUF 5 million, with no real economic activity behind it.
No cash either, because the accounts completed have been rescheduled, but this has already been reported in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing the invoice shall be those linked to the defendants.
Thus, the managing officer of Delta Trió Kft., which is based in Budapest, was Iván Kubatov, who was responsible for the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company also issued several invoices for the sale of computing equipment in October, November and December 2005 at around HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft., which was in the process of winding up since 14 September 2005.
This company was the managing director of a Romanian man who would also have been transferred by Iván Kubatov from 2002 to 2005.
We understand that in the course of the investigation, Cubatov acknowledged that he issued an invoice on behalf of the Kft to Atlas, Hoppa and the Third Year Foundation, and he took their opposition.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian architects founded Fa-Bani Jos Faksipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies really worked, according to the defendant, was the reason they didn't get a job.
However, the companies benefited because, at the request of Szente Zsolt, who also makes the company's papers, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
The Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 accounts to the organisations, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The D.A. considered that 10 percent of the amounts in the accounts and VAT had been hit by Mark Kubatov.
The man even used Si-Beri Bt. to issue fictional accounts, they were produced for Commissioner Pont's tender.
The Y-Generation and the Alliance have submitted proposals for Modern Hungary in January 2006 for the public benefit organisation of the Socialist Party, the Dances Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order to keep this under review, the Works Team Kft. has submitted five fictional accounts to TMA.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsi in his office in his educational wallet.
Part of the defendants in the trial, as did the D.A., is likely to report on the process of accounting production.
The most interesting thing is that when you are the defendant, János Zuschlag decides to push the veil over everything.
His statement so far is not too detailed, and although he has promised to speak in broad terms, he has not done so yet.
The question of whether or not there is a large part of the damage, the Socialists made a deal with it in the head of the 50 million forints, and Zusi takes the fall.
Anyone who may have been offended by it may now have been found to have been constantly deaf ears to alleviate the circumstances of his holding, i.e. to place his applications in custody.
While the perpetrators of much greater damage and economic crimes that do not result in them can walk freely or wait at least in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, there is no possibility for them to do so.
Psychology of overlicitation: Why should we give more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to issue more money, overrated goods.
These well - known and seemingly irrational behaviours have been discovered by researchers at the New York University of Neurologists and economists.
According to a study published in Science, people do not want to fall below a type of competition such as eBay’s auction, so they also pay too high prices.
He was trying to map this game of research on the nervous system by using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers took part in a lottery, the other group of players auctioning while examining the active brain areas of experimental subjects using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which an important element of the other party overicing - a complex under the striatum, a complex under the brain, worked intensively when the game was lost.
This area plays a role in the nervous system’s ‘responsible’ mechanism in addition to several other functions.
For this reason, researchers believe that it is possible to explain the price by avoiding the acute reaction of the striatum.
In order to support their theory, the members of the research group’s economists have also carried out a financial monitoring study.
In these three groups lyciated against a partner in different circumstances.
The control group simply reported the real value of the product in question and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if a winner comes out of the game, they'll get another $15 worth.
The third group, however, just received $15 before the auction, but the group members lost this money in the event of a loss auction.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that one of them was given the emphasis on winning and the loss for the other.
However, in demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the “lost ” team were willing to take higher stakes than control and power.
“These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
For so far, only the joy of victory and risk avoidance have explained the events of auction.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, so that we have now reached a third explanation, ” concluded Andrew Schotter, professor of economic faculties at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should we seek medical advice?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and among the leading causes of death, chronic liver disease is mentioned in Hungary.
The number of domestic hepatitis patients is 100, but only seven thousand are treated, which is why patients often do not know that they are infected.
The designation of hepatitis is a compound name for infectious liver products caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, typical of liver inflammation and yellowness, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses range in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the feeding channel (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sand, vaginal discharge, saliva).
Travelers are definitely worth protecting against A and B virus, with no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis The symptoms are two to three weeks after the intake of infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal disorder and nausea.
After this occurs yellowness on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the stools are clear, the urine becomes dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
One million people die from more severe types of disease around the world, liver cancer and liver dysfunction caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every ten of them are infected with medication.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if you are not treated, it can also lead to hepatic impairment and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease because the pathogens destroy the liver cells, in many cases only 20 to 30 years from now, the first symptoms will occur.
Thus, it is very important to carry out early prevention, regular screening.
In three groups, this type of disease is much more than average: between people undergoing blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
There are currently 200 million people worldwide infected with chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease may already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is recommended that any unknown symptom be treated with a pediatrician.
In time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, so that the infectivity and the development of cancer can be eliminated.
30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by patient organisations around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver inflammation, development of viruses and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God hurts less?
According to a recent study, religious faith works as a kind of painkiller, which may have made it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists of Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment, examining the way in which the divine faith influences people’s sense of pain, revealed British Telegraph.
In a rather bizar study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were involved in electronics, while all of them studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain-retarding technique, Catholics were also able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers, and theologists are involved in various aspects of the university.
The test took place exactly as a means of strengthening an experimentation device to the left hand of the test subject, which provided an electroscopic shock.
The researchers asked the experimenters to look closely at two paintings of the Lady Mary of the 17th century by Sassoferrato and Leonardo da Vinci with Lady Hermelin in the 15th century.
The investigators of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a religious status among the believers, while the image of the da Vinci was chosen because they thought it was not too different from the other and they thought it was calm.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during this time 20 electro shocks were given four consecutive parts, either watching a religious topic or a general picture.
Catholics reported that during the sight of Mary the Virgin, they felt “safe, ” as they were“ concerned, ” and “restraint, ” filled them with peace.
During the religious perspective, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo was seen in front of you.
Miguel Fairias, a psychologist who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong image, even with ateists, only with the right photo to find.
“ We should find a picture of someone who is very positive about being treated as a mother or a father, ” said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases change our personality, ” added Wright.
After the excellent results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter showed the believers the image of a Madonna, what would have an impact on their pain control?
Would the vision of Mary of the quality virgin even result in better results?
You're what you share about yourself.
On your tenth birthday, you can tell Google: you can find at least as much in people's pockets as in the sky above your head; you know where they were vacationing, what kind of professional orders they are doing and what they are interested in.
And this is still not enough for Eric Schmidt, according to one of the main guys in the company.
As far as sceptics are concerned with Orwell's nightmare, they don't see exactly the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently declared to the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose was to collect more personal data about its users, and this is necessary to keep themselves in the original target of Google founders, which said: “Let’s get all the information in the world into the system. ”
According to the posted Google leader, the company is only in the beginning to handle all the information after ten years of world-renowned work.
To ask what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as \"what to do tomorrow,\" or \"what kind of work would really fit me,\" but until then, the software is unable to answer such simple questions because they are unable to meet users.
Not all internet users are aware that in the search for the Internet, search terms are correctly recorded for which IP address they were looking for and what page they were looking for.
Using the personalised Search that started two years ago, users can, for example, store their own surfing background history, look back what they were looking for, and then click on them, and generate more personalized hits in the long term - the same logic will be based on the Communications that offer us products and services based on our previous and fixed preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I'm dealing with? - the users who are concerned about seeing Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom, or a rebellion against power, in the Internet.
However, it has been confirmed that all the terms sought are not only recorded but can be transferred to third parties where appropriate, and in such legal cases, the personality rights of Internet users are not protected by any such rights.
The loudspeaker of recent times may have been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided information about pedophiles on the Community site maintained by the Brazilian government on the Orkut, which enables identification.
In May, however, Internet users concerned with personality rights may have turned their backs when the company has successfully proved its trueness in court against the FBI: Google may not subsequently be forced by any point in the Constitution to provide any information that the FBI secretly requested.
(In recent times, the federal government successfully fought some 500,000 web addresses and thousands of search statements that were obtained by reference to the strengthening of the previously adopted child protection law, but still it was unable to obtain the full list of websites and keywords covering two months.)
Thus, Google’s assessment is quite controversial: they are fooled by those who keep their personal data from giving them because they feel intimate and private by starting to use Google’s services and being exposed to the Conservative multi-companies.
In the meantime, the American gene culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists, user-companies are seeing the next generation of big companies, the \"flight corporation\" in them, unlike the rivals, Microsoft as world-class because of Windows, no matter how much they fight for the same purpose.
This can happen because Google does not request user identification code in a way other than Microsoft, does not request money for its applications, the open, free, kept updated source code and software package are much more accessible, younger, and cooler in its official software business.
However, there may also be the fact that the genes see a very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which is one of the most commonly expressed keywords in recent years, following the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 is about co-laboration, the fact that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels at our disposal and, while they vary from person to person, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
A typical young person can also lead profile from Facebook to Xang, link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that list his music habits, and then connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, also lead a blog that automatically displays the latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picas.
While you can read many examples of how it is revealed: a friend can easily discover the morning price of a common circle of friends, seeing that a friend of hers spent the evening with whom she was cheating or to fire a company's employee just because she describes her sincere opinion on senior management in her blog: a certain, private life concept has been fully overrated to now.
If you live online, it is about what you show, which means that you can imagine the foundation behind the behavior of today’s young people.
And who wants to hide something or at least avoid Google monopoly, can do it (for example, using Google's search system, but not deliberately leaving a trace of Scrogle).
For example, the number of people who do not register with their intended intentions on social sites, so that they cannot be identified, Google's online applications from the text editor to the image manager and newsreader can be replaced by alternative versions that do not link to huge server parks and do not produce the best profiles that we have ever had.
Public opinion does not expect so secretly when Google shows the whiteness of the teeth.
The company's current worth 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and services introduced at an increasing rate cause serious headache not only to Microsoft but also to many other software developers.
However, critics also find opposites to the alarmer: senior management, for example, completely rejected employees’ protest, after increasing the fee for a corporate shelter, found that business management is too expensive to feed employees daily, but all the fact that Google, even in 2006, had run heads in front of the Chinese government and under their agreement, found that the company would pick up all the hits that violate the good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds like not to advertise a new service in advance, only when it is available for use, but surely, the problems of the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine screening and distribution projects are of such size that the company will soon have to face up to the Supreme Court of America, others fearing the health system, in which we can build a complete health profile of our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can provide good material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, Scroogled point orwell, describes the future in which a person can easily be approached from Google's data.
Two young people helped the ancient double killer in the printing medal.
Two young people were interviewed by the police in the case of the ancient double murder, and they were suspected to assist in the prosecution of the crime, said the spokesperson of the Borsod County Police Department on Tuesday.
The young people acknowledged the act imposed on them, are currently accused of crime.
According to information from the two young people, the MTI, two girls defend themselves on the loose.
Punishment may be punishable by imprisonment of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the ancient double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
He's premeditated, prosecuted, suspected of murdering more people.
The investigation revealed that 23-year-old young men owed a higher amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to compensate for his debt, so he lured his creditor to an ancient facility last Wednesday, where he killed him, and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, which is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
The police will examine the circumstances of the weapon and its use with expert involvement.
The stock exchange in Warsaw has offered for the purchase of the stock exchange in Prague
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of the 100 percent stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer which the Polish have made despite the fact that the stock exchange in Warsaw was previously excluded by the Czechs from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99 percent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the papers during the course of a few months.
The E15 Czech economic newspaper new knows that the offer of Poles is the highest amount offered so far by interested parties for the stock exchange in Prague.
According to the Czech newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Exchange have so far offered an offer.
Petr Koblic, chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that, among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner and did not rule out that this would lead to the abolition of the Prague stock exchange.
The value of the stock exchange in Prague is estimated by market experts at 5-10 billion kroons.
On the basis of the agreement of the shareholders, approximately 90 percent of the documents could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is Patria Finance investment bank with around 25 percent of its shares, followed by Ceska Sporitelna Bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. by 13,5 percent.
From the perspective of European pages on the financial crisis
The European pages, which led to the growing international financial crisis in their comments on Tuesday, now refer to September 11 second.
We owe the President of the United States a global financial disaster - accused of Roman La Repubblica - the President was not even able to line up his own party behind the proposal for a law that was drawn up in his wound, aimed at remedying the desperate situation...
Instead of Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett's billion-dollar investor, it is more appropriate to talk about September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there led the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress vote, Washington is in danger of offering no political means to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, even when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - points to the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still provide life support to support financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if more banks collapse like domino cubes, then neither the funds nor any further bail-outs will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to go beyond national selfishness and to centralise controls on split money markets.
Only Monday, more than 100 billion euros were received by sick financial institutions - remembers the Vienna Der Standard, which says that the concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, have to go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far dealt with the crisis, which is sweeping through the old continent as a tsunami.
The rescue workers do not have to spend almost a hundred billion euros, but it would be good if I recorded it: in which case it is reasonable to put an end to the prevention of greater damage to taxpayers' money.
He's completing the flight to the smart car.
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid conflict if we did not imitate accessibility sensors in the world of nature?
Like bees.
In the surprising project at CEATEC in Japan, Dongo bees gave the strategic starting thought to Nissan engineers in order to build the next generation of conflict prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C biodegradable autobot control system, a robotized miniuator equipped with bees' properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, every bee will develop its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our security shield - explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR and Research Development brand.
Its role is important to the complex eyes of the uterus, which can see in every direction at more than 300 degrees of angle.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers reached the idea of laser telescopes.
Before BR23C, it identifies obstacles within a 2 m radius of 180 degrees of visual space, calculates their distances and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which will immediately become an action to avoid impact.
During the fraction of the second it occurs to detect the obstacle and then car robots, following the movement of the uterus, will immediately change the direction of wheels by turning away the extent necessary to avoid impact.
Unlike any current system, this avoidr is carried out in a completely stimulating way.
“If this were not the case, the car robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles, ” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the Mobility Laboratory and the driver of the car robot project.
It must respond in an experiential manner and immediately, as this technology is the most vulnerable and incessant layer of safety shields, a layer in which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be carried out in a blinking way.
However, in a way other than bees, the difference should not be directed upwards, downwards or transversal, but only towards the ability of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite opportunity available for bees to avoid other bees, only rolling movement and acceleration and slowing were used as an opportunity for car robots.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more energy density, meaning that their life span is longer than that of lithium ion.
According to Andoh, an incentive intelligent reaction is an important, not the ability to process data, even less.
This structure has to process and react to only a few input signals per second.
It is not necessary to maintain them and respond with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so that only a few dozen kilowats of memory are constantly used.
There's no need for gigabahjam, or the memory of the size.
This is the first step towards developing immediate-out technology, which, according to Nissan's estimate, can be involved in serial-produced cars within ten years.
Additional application options may be used to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system in order to lead the car to the end end end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He even became a name to the poison kid.
The written version of the economic rescue package of $700 billion for the purchase of bad loans by banks has been completed in several instalments.
In the first round, half of the money is spent.
According to the Eastern Party time, in the new negotiations until midnight, the Congressional leaders reached a break in the debate around a total of $700 billion rescue packages - Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress - told by Nancy Pelosi, President of the Democratic Party House of the United States that there is only the agreement left on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson stated on the outcome of the compromise: the programme will be operational and effective, but there will also be a need for further action. Pelosi said that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy into a sequence.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday evening 8 (i.e., the Central European Time at two o'clock in the morning) but did not cause a spectacular run on the borough.
On the draft law on the law on the programme, which will be subject to the 2008 Economic Emergency Stability Act, the House will vote on the bill on Monday for the first time, and the Council will have its seat on the agenda.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made last night, and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - announced by Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, by the way, differs from the initial Bush Administration proposal, which would have meant that $700 billion would have been spent on buying bad quality debt securities at the same time.
For the first time, up to half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent immediately after Congress is expected to vote on this issue on Monday, the Ministry of Finance's credit buys back-to-back securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
The programme will be checked by a separate body, including the Chairman of Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactics: you can buy bad loans, mortgage and mortgage securities at the same time, as well as other types of 'toxic' loans.
Buying within and directly through auctions - the competent authorities of the Ministry have been informed.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial wallet guarantees the means of concern for the payment of a fee corresponding to the expected losses by the companies.
Henry Paulson said that the law would provide the necessary tools to bring up to $ 700 billion in urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is about buying a broad range of bad assets, whether it is insurance or avoiding systemic risks arising from a collapse of a large financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed - he has done so.
On the other hand, bank managers in trouble and waiting for state aid can expect to limit their withdrawal money - which the overseas slang simply calls a gold drop-off - to the government.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys an auction, it puts extra taxes on the gold divestment, unless it is sent to retirement for the public bank management.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management money should not be overrun.
The image includes the fact that the existing gold divestment contracts do not change, the restriction only applies to new ones so as to encourage participation in the programme as well.
This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs - he commented on the measure by the President of the House's Committee on Financial Services, Mr Barney Frank of the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, so the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they may eventually win on the transaction, as the economy and the saved bank stand together.
The draft law states that for the next five years, the President shall submit to the Congress a proposal providing for the recovery of the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
There were, of course, people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens asked us to do, which means that it does not protect taxpayers' dollars - declared by the Republican representative of Darrell Issa from California.
A member of the Ohio Democratic Group, Mary Kapitur, believed that the same measures were advocated by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

A higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical, product manufacturing (1.6 per cent).
Price reduction occurred in oil processing (1.4%), electrical machinery, instrument production (0.9 percent) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishers and printing activities have not changed.
In other processing sectors, we measured an increase of between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors representing a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the prolonged effect of official gas sales from 1 July.
In comparison to twelve months, given the domestic sales of the processing sector, prices in the oil processing sector grew to the greatest extent (32.4%).
The production of metal-processing products in the sector was 13.2 per cent, with a 11 per cent increase in the price of food, drink and tobacco manufactured.
Price reduction occurred in the sectors of textiles, textiles production (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and instrument production (0.3 per cent).

Next year, you don't need a visa for the United States?
Göncz Kinga has a good chance of entering into the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement by 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, \"now everything depends well only on whether the electronic access and control system across the sea will be built in good time\"
At the same time, he pointed out that the new system will not have a travel authorisation, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian Head of Diplomacy is negotiating in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will be handed over by the Central Cross of the Republic of Hungary's Interest to the Star and will hold talks with foreign policy advisors from Barack Obama's Democratic Party and John McCain's Republican Republican President.
We've got the bank rescue package next to Barack Obama and McCain.
On Sunday, both Barack Obama and John McCain, the President-in-Office of the two major American parties, provided the Government with a bank rescue package of $700 billion, but there are politicians who demand the withdrawal of the Minister of Finance.
After the negotiations of the Congress and Administration, they announced on Sunday morning: they concluded an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The financial package for the crisis in Wall Street and the reading of the frozen credit market has become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also state themselves: it is more suitable for their competitors to withdraw the country from the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, with the economic front, Obama once again gained some advantage, melted the advantage of McCain, which, after the Republican convention, was nominated by Vice-President Sarah Palin.
Obama, at a campaign meeting in Detroit, expressed his hope on Sunday that the law on the 700 billion package would be adopted by the Congress rapidly.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection pass which he also supported.
“Now we have to act with responsibility (...) for your job, for your savings, for the whole industry, for the stability of the whole economy, ” he said, before the 35 thousand people.
You didn't miss calling McCain's economic vision a long time ago.
McCain explained in an interview to ABC, “We will all find it difficult to swallow it (...) but nothing can simply be done.
The Republican Senator announced that the proposal included setting up a committee monitoring the Minister of Finance and limiting the execution of top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no proper role in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the minister.
President Pelosi announced on Sunday that the House was hopefully voting on the bill on Monday.
Cards of the German language area
The right-hand camp has become more self-conscious within the camp - thus analysing the weak role of Der Spiegel in Bajormaa.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (speegel.de)
In the online release of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, Bajorország’s revolution, explains the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to known polyologists, CSU's erosion has begun quite well before the sad Duke of Beckstein-Huber took over.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have renewed Bajoran, and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The changing era is also the problem of Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but it ended on Sunday a process that was likely to be nearly ten years ago: an undisputed hemony of a state party has ceased.
It's been ten years since the CSU landed at 47.7 percent in 1998, for the first time since the 1950s, below 50 percent.
This has been repeated three years in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so even so much in the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistently implemented modernisation of CSU's province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were wrong. However, there could not have been consequences for CSU's loyalty to the voters, the results of education, the integration of East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bajorland.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in potential, with political consequences visible.
The right-hand camp has become more self-conscious, more critical, more self-observable within the camp.
It is also remarkable that, in the last few weeks, classical civilian groups have just been removed from CSU most; free professionals, professionals, graduates and higher-level graduates.
CSU's support is 40% down here.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The article on the Conservative Vienna Day, entitled “Who, Who? The Party Presidents in the Reconciliation Coalition Questions, ” deals with the confused domestic policy situation that has developed since the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its home affairs.
The BZÖ shows that negotiations are open in all directions, the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The election has been made, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debate on public service television, the party leaders have hardly allowed a look at their cards.
The president, Mr Faymann, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties - in some areas and in the social partnership.
The question is whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current President of the ÖVP, as well as with the initial cell, - Faymann left open.
As you put it, the Schüssel-Molter course was handed down to any other point.
Repeating this course is not going to happen.
Molterer carefully responded to red tenders.
As he said, you will certainly not be effective in cooperating if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
To choose the opposition or enter the coalition, it is still completely open in the party, the questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider has repeatedly shown me open in every direction.
“How to prevent the red and black coalition, we are prepared to assume government responsibility, ” says Haider.
Járóka: The evil circle of poverty, segmentation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities was launched in Paris, France, representing the Presidency of the European Union.
In his message of Járóka Livia, the paying representative of the European People's Party, as one of the main speakers of the professional council, he called attention to education segmentation, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and this is also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The high-level conference was opened by Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Mr Spidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most significant European legal and civil society organisations were invited to the consultation.
Mr Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to discrimination on employment, Roma are in need of the labour market in particular through their low level of education.
\"The vast majority of Roma young people have no secondary education and, as a result of poor-quality basic education, only an insignificant part of them can gain higher education.\"
He also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children could mean strengthening the economy of European Union Member States.
According to the honourable Member, these links are needed in the widest sense, among the Roma and not the Roma.
As early as the Roma student begins school, it will increase the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market; they will contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
\"The Roma must guarantee EU citizenship their rights to quality education and ensure the elimination of low-quality and isolated education,\" Járóka Livia stressed.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's aim and action-oriented coordination is necessary to speed up school degression processes immediately, and it is essential to ensure that existing and planned anti-discrimination policies are properly respected.
“It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment, and to give Roma children the opportunities of democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens, ” Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Equal Opportunities Summit to be held annually from last year in Berlin is to provide a unique forum for promoting equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, they will decide on the fate of the duo duo of Huber-Bekkstein
Despite the ugly election failure, heads have not yet fallen, the Bajoran CSU summits have been rejected for the time to discuss personal issues.
Mr. Erwin Huber and the Prime Minister of Günther Beckstein will still remain in position, the question of how long the grace lasts.
On the last weekend of October, the fate of a 17 - percent disaster relief student will be decided by extraordinary parties.
The members of the many critics recognized that they did not stick to their chairs with all their strengths.
This made efforts to calm down the angry members of the group and base, who once a day after the “bajor tsunami, ” demanding personal contacts due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago, true, even with the leadership of Edmund Stoiber on the top of his career, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, but now one year after the Stoiber puck, it only ran 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, CSU has been “one-managed, 18 percent of German GDP in Bajormaa.
The Conservatives continue to expect high levels of consolidation in the southern region, which is key to the Hungarian economy, and will certainly be forced to coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of a procession within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture will also be able to find themselves in the narrow search team to start with the liberal FDP and the Free Electoral Elections organised along the right.
The strange fintor of fate is that on the Free Electoral List, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used as a double-bekstein co-opportunity, and then he was ungratefully treated with a large-scale municipal politician.
CSU leaders are turning all their energy into a way to stabilize Beckstein.
The transition will have an active role to play so far, too, the Stoiber from the background, the former Prime Minister of State and former CSU Prime Minister called it the most bitter day of September 28.
On Monday Huber gave me a few bit of notes to the CDU, he thought they would have earned a lot more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Mr Merkel cannot be a Chancellor if the CSU, which has played a significant role in the success of the country in 2005, is somehow not on its feet.
According to Merkel, the loss of CSU soil will not have a negative impact on the large coalition in Berlin.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be treated more easily and the socio-democrat crisis will continue.
The SPD has achieved the weakest result since 1946 in Bajormaa.
Lukashenko: 110-0
No opposition representative entered the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is due to welfare and stability in the country under management, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (EBESZ), the irregularities committed during the vote counting can be explained.
EBESZ, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the 100 million-person laws of the 10 million countries have been against the opposition for a decade, before yesterday's election, the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) strongly hoped that, following the amendment of the Constitution, the presidency's mandate of the 2006 elections of cleanliness would be renewed four times this time by Lukashenko, allowing some opposition representatives to appear in Parliament.
The ODS therefore also stopped the pre-weighted ankle.
In the background of the opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia, and which has been lending to the continuously expensive Russian gas imports, and has also contributed to the delivery of the gas pipelines across the country - has been willing to improve its relationship with the EU where, due to the anti-democratic political situation, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are not authorised to enter.
In advance, it indicated that in the assessment of the election campaign, the OSCE placed emphasis on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as banning the third opponents from starting.
However, the rapid report by the OSCE on Monday has already objected to the campaign - in which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present in the calculation of votes.
Together with this, the opposition has shown a marked improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to confiscate with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of Georgia's breaking South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia - with which Belarus is a federal state - has been regarded as independent for a month now.
- We have taken two steps forward, one for the rest, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started - said to our page, Mr Milinkevics.
According to the opposition to the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, even though “the power was afraid to let even one opposition in a weightless parliament, ”
The opposition is not planning any protesting actions in view of the results, rather trying to send a message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, and we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, and we are creating obstacles to the transmission by local authorities, but I can see that more and more people are supporting change, including the elderly - said Milinkevics, referring to the Lukasenko regime, which considers it to be the main result of social security, even the most officially supported pensioners do not consider it appropriate.
- Because of the country's debt, the increase in trade deficits, the time has come for the \"decrease\" of social security, which was called Milinkevics.
In contrast to the opposition politicians, Russian observers considered elections to be democratic.
Sergei Lebeyev, head of the Watch Tower Society of the United States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosztyi: “Not the words, but the people who believe in the actions, ” so the lack of opposition is proof of maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: \"Reggel only before work\"
In the history of Chigi Palace, there have been unique applications for the admission and entry of workers.
From today on, this new measure will be in place against the prosecutors, to filter out those who block and then go out to drink a coffee in working hours.
Today, the new anti-lock was presented to the Secretary-General of the Government of Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, the Prime Minister's Office.
\"The turning loop - said Brunetta - is for better and more efficient work, reducing deficits and increasing services\"
\"There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform - emphasised Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says that ‘the installation of a roller cap is also important from a symbolic point of view,’
The Secretary-General confirmed: “The workers approved the measure and everyone cooperated –
So, breakfast is over in working hours, no more coffee and no more cool.
Brunetta lamentes: “A good capuccino at seven o’clock in the morning, capable of miracles, ” he says.
At the Roman Public Administration College
The Minister stated: “In three months, the public health deficits were reduced by 50 percent, which means more than 60 thousand people in one year, ”
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
, whose wage dynamics, according to the Minister, have been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8 to 10 years and have been well above the inflation rate,
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered together, joining a submission supported by the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Organisation to protest against the requirements of the Brunetta Regulation.
“As the Minister of Public Administration boasts of data to support the reduction of disease deficits, the war of the “untiring sunk” continues to grow, says the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of honest and hard - working administrative staff across Italy gathered to report war on the lawfulness of the regulation,
The Regional Administrative Court shall, inter alia, challenge the abolition of additional care allowance due to sickness caused for reasons of service, the extension of the period of stay of workers on sick leave, which means the period during which the patient may appear and several other aspects included in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Occupational accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
Every day in Italy there are 2500 accidents at work, 3 of which end with death and 27 with permanent disability.
According to accident insurance at work, nearly 1.200 deaths were reported in 2007.
The numbers testify about the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and require almost twice as many victims as killing.
Today, Anmil organises the day of the accidents at work traditionally held on the second Sunday of October on the 58th time in every county of Italy to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
“The worrying information provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirms that prevention has a prominent role to play in the message to President Pietro Mercandelli of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, the President of the Association for the Balesie Rokkantak National Labour Office.
The Head of State has rightly respected the “permanent commitment of the association to preventing work, protecting workers who have suffered an accident, helping family members of victims, and bringing the public into their hands, ”
“This kind of atrocities, as well as the tragedy of media and public opinion, are created by natural and well divided, but in reality we must face the dramatic, repeated and repeated events of the day –
Napolitano openly admits: “We have no resources to deal with, and the financing of education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within schools aimed at providing direct education to young people who are at risk of entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to the social importance of the issue, as well as more effective legislation to be taken into account.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the House, stressed: “The serious accidents at work that have occurred at death, the social importance of all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible, ” said Gianfranco Fini.
“The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still amazingly high, ” noted Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“We do not want to see this downward trend combined with a downward trend, as the greatest tragedy happens when attention is lost, ”
\"We believe that at general level we still do not do everything we can to overcome the phenomenon, which can be solved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, more supervision and control would be needed - he stressed the need for more intensive action in the field of labour training from school education –
He added: “There is a need for further efforts to inform and inform the public, including toothpaste.
What would be most necessary, however, is a more responsible employer environment in relation to a phenomenon that presents a social problem.
Mercandelli then judged the gradual deterioration of the protection net for victims of accidents at work as well as the ‘aid direction towards which the system is spreading in recent years’.
“The aim is therefore to give back to workers the security provided by insurance, because the fate of those who suffer an accident cannot depend on where lawmakers are selfish and where they are divided, ”
Hearing damage to MP3 players
Hearing damage to stay can be caused by listening to portable players for longer and high volume such as MP3 devices -
in its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, referring to today's opinion by the Scientific Committee on New and Newly identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
“The opinion shows that hearing damage of 5-10 percent may be caused by those who listen to their portable composers for more than one hour per day for five years, with a high volume of voice, ” explains the explanation.
“I am concerned that young people who use portable music players and cell phones in high volume use mass and frequency are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearings, ” said Meglena Kuneva.
\"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk that we should urgently respond to,\" added the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this.
In the light of this opinion, we must also review existing control systems in order to be able to function effectively and to keep pace with the latest technologies.
Brussels called on the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people who had been exposed to noise pollution.
\"The researchers confirm that we have concerns, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people who are exposed to noise by portable players and similar means,\" said the Committee member.
The current European Safety Regulation (EU) No 100 dB sets out maximum noise levels for portable composers, while increasing concern is accompanied by data on hearing damage caused by excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing damage.
In its scientific opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that those using portable players who listen to music with high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week exceed the maximum present value of noise at work.
If a person listens to music for longer than five years in similar circumstances, there is a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5 to 10 percent of people using portable equipment, which could mean 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It begins today, until March, the results are expected in June.
This is the timetable for the operation of the Committee called “Romanian Cathedral City, ” which met this morning at the new headquarters behind Caracolla's bath.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop Rome's directives.
Following the March final reading, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Board of Directors in order to be able to present the capital strategy plan officially approved by the Government and the Prime Minister of Gianni Alemanno in June.
“This is an entirely independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented - and Alermanno - is responsible for drawing up proposals for the development ideas of Rome on which political decision-makers, including the General Assembly and the Committee on Local Government, can rely.
It is not a matter of incompatibility, but we would have liked a platform where large plans for Rome could be created.
In March, after he has done his job, the committee will be disbanded because he has a mandate for a fixed term.
In June, we presented a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee entitled \"The Future of Rome's Cathedral\" - the Master General said.
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, on the grounds that the opinion it sets out cannot be binding, Alemanno replied: “It depends on what type of work the Commission will do and on what quality of proposals it will put on the table.
If the standards prove appropriate, as in France, in the case of the Attali Committee, which I am sure of for Rome, the contribution it has made will have an important role to play.
The power of politics is often divided into daily affairs and urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we, taking into account the surrounding aspects, look further and plan for a longer term and work committed to the development and future of Rome –
The mayor of Rome wants to point out that \"this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless \"waterhead\" because it is absolutely free, it will not be in one euro for Roman citizens, while it serves as an incentive to think and to involve the best minds in the capital\".
According to Alemanno, “there is a need for an open-end and flexible strategic framework that allows our town to jump in a high quality, so he would need to think about his future in a united spirit, ”
About the future in which the mayor of Rome stresses: “It will not only be limited to the current municipal framework but will look much further away, but it will not only see the future metropolis and the capital status, but also the role it can play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean, and it must also be filled in.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well - known, independent American politician wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first Jimmy Carter, who decided to destroy the American economy and to develop close relations (as a private person today) with the enemy Islam,
As the time of the elections is approaching, attacks on Obama are becoming more frequent.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: “This man is full of ambition.
Obama believes that he can gain the highest public dignity of a nation that has so far become two governors and five senators,
These attacks are, in fact, nothing to be said; they are racist, but they do not answer the voters' question whether they will be a good president. Then there are polls here: Obama will win with a significant side.
In that case, there is someone who does not listen to his feelings and minds.
In the south of the United States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in the lead article: we know that the true American patriot who casts his vote in the vote.
There is a side of American thinking that remains hidden until the last minute.
\"Just tell us what you want, and we'll know where we'll put the yoke, Obama or McCain.\"
Some say that if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
Such words have never spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these intelligences, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1500 people asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's term of office? 89% answered that Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they're makin' it all the way to home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was a weak point in Bush.
There's a huge task waiting for George W. to take over.
The US: economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time has come in the editors, and many blame the Internet for printing press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists how they feel about their future situation and their spiritual power.
Well, right now, almost every journalist's plague on his own future.
However, they did not clearly claim to have reduced their concerns as regards authenticity.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They think the crisis in 2008 is a failure of an inefficient economic model.
There is a further serious problem with newsrooms, i.e. the restrictions on newspaper editors.
If we do not want the traditional journalism, in the sense of what the great public has understood during this, to minimize, this problem must be solved - the surveyed journalists say.
These days, well-seen and complex Pesymism characterises the American newspaper.
Sixty per cent of journalists and top executives working in the printed press are convinced that national tynalistics are on the wrong path.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in top management.
Printed versus electronic press.
Press staff have no difficulty seeing where the world network is going.
The biggest publishers are trying to find their way to the Internet, which many people believe is the print press's killer.
The \"economic pressure\" observed by journalists increased to 79 percent.
The 500 asked journalists admitted that he would put him down with the technology, hoping that he would benefit from the tyrnalistics.
Today, in the American press, there is a gap between the editors, the directors and the reporters who work for them.
At national level, 56% of managers are certain that their journalists share their information with others, while at local level this rate can only be done to 23 percent.
Some of these are linked to a safe job.
At national level, 47 percent of managers are afraid that they will lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of \"safe work\" is constantly on the agenda at team level (for our editors, equipment).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a vast nation like the United States of 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers are active, employers are generally offering as much as they want, so the matter is \"no or no\" on the basis.
Directors are generally paid high, and editors can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to paying their pension and health insurance fee.
On the other hand, freedom works quite complexly: in the first year x day, in the third, until, after a certain period, it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own statement, often “be ill during the year ”
It's all a function of the climate.
UNIPOL: RÓMAI REPUBLIC: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTARATABAN MARAD
Mr Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Court of Rome rejected Danilo Coppola's application for a real estate profession, who wanted to go from his place of residence to a Roman apartment in Grottaferrata.
There is an economic bankruptcy investigation against Coppola in the context of the investigation of the Unipol-BNL stock swap agreement.
Last week, in the course of the proceedings against him, the house arrest was lifted and it was changed to a ban on the residence permit for Grottaferrat.
Lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate expert enter the town center of the country.
However, according to the court, these influx (for which the prosecutor has made a refusal) would enable the company to influence and access the evidence it has brought against it.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago when the Assembly did not vote on the $700 billion rescue package put in place by the White House: the majority of Americans were more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times of yesterday also supports this, which reports that the current crisis has broken down within the Republican Party, which shows an increasing division between the traditional, restrained Eastern Party, the federal institutions and business circles, and the ever-growing anti-Governance trend in the Central and Southern states.
This direction has been expressed in a critical way during the parliamentary vote referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is just one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still taking place in the United States, not only in the Western world, but also in the rest of the world.
It appears that the crisis, in the USA and in Europe, only accelerates the already well-established phenomena that will be consolidated in this new atmosphere and will finally come to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-activeisation, the re-nationalisation of the two categories of state sovereignty into public awareness, a re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis affects banking financial institutions that are in close contact with foreign countries, but it is mainly and quite wide, with people and families that live in a single country.
This, however, is a direct political challenge for those in the government to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are otherwise elected.
So, in the economic sense, the crisis appears to be global, but in a political sense it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism was essentially outside the coastline: the European Union, which cannot set a uniform political direction between different interests and national strategies.
So everyone waits for intervention, rescue kits, recovery and new rules from each national government, but above all opening up funds: since in a difficult situation, only individual states have economic resources, a financial stock that can fix things.
They also have the means and the power to use them: they have two inestimable sources in certain circumstances, which are likely to have no other market and no international organisation will have such an extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the nation state by the crisis is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times is giving rise to increasing importance to a factor closely linked to this mind: this is territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the network, the world of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world had been assigned to rule the world, we had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were less and less abstract than water, crops and oil.
From things that can be transported from one part of the planet to the other, to a completely surrounded place, it can be connected to one area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more punch cards than the one who was born in a place where there is no crop, there is no oil and there is no water.
I would thus turn to the second novelty, which is a kind of breaking line.
Who says that territory, state, government, is necessarily also saying: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis appears to produce two cohesive phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for a credible leadership is one of those who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current management, in particular the total loss of credit for economic leaders, proved to be completely inappropriate and proved to be much of the blurry area ahead of them.
Together, the two have even greater significance and, in a certain sense, more disturbing: the feeling of credit loss, unrest, insatisfaction and isolation, which affects the entire body of leaders in several Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the growing number of the population is the belief that the social elite that has been at the top of this period has expired. It has been running before their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, their complex meanings of the word, and the social elite is becoming increasingly degraded from the opinion of the majority.
In the same way, the need for leadership is expressed in the form of sudden changes in public procurement. For example, the achievement of conservative power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of labour force in Great Britain, or the rebellion of American Congressional representatives against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right can also be classified here).
It seems that the traditional elite, parties, programs, and even the fact that it is in college with its customs, press, and its famous intellectuality, is becoming less and less understood, and therefore it is becoming less and less capable of representing what is going on in the deeper layers of Western society for some time. Furthermore, the economic crisis is getting stronger, spreading and potentially capable of creating ever more dire moves.
Despite all this, “the insurrection of the masses, ” it would be a genuine extremism.
But with an open eye, it doesn't hurt at all.
We can walk through the wall with a super powerful tape.
Using a super-powered glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This was set at several American research centres, and a group formed by four institutions is close to solving it.
With only a 2.5 square centimetre strip, researchers managed to tape a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American magazine TANULMÁNY - Science published the findings of some researchers at Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance invented by the group of scientists has already been developed from the further development of special, új carbon nanotube materials.
“The principle of glue must be imagined as a set of tube systems similar to spaghetti, ” says Zhong Lin Wang, researchers of the Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers drew the idea of the foot of the gecko microscopic radii, which provides the animal with perfect grips.
The tests carried out with various materials, such as glass, teflon and gauze paper, have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the soles of these seals, but at the same time, it is easily removed from the wall, explains Liming Dai, researcher of the engineering arm of the University of Dayton.
FALON JÁNI? - This material can be useful as a temporary glue – it adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers think about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good for heat and electricity.
You can also find additional applications in the field of space research.
The superheroes can wait.
MANUFACTURE - the University of Berkeley in California is also conducting experiments with a new glue.
According to the article published in American Chemical Society C., Californian scientists have presented a hair-like, microfibre adhesive that is going through self-cleaning while moving on the surface, thus always providing a perfect touch.
It's not allowed with fruit.
Care should be taken with grappephruit, orange and alma.
These high-vitamin, mainly popular in the summer when administered in combination with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, if appropriate, increased or reduced their effects. This may also have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, Professor of Western Ontario of London University of Western Ontario, reported on the risks of combined use of box or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products. The professor announced the state meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of graphefruit, orange or apple juice is able to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and putting the patient at risk.
Grapefruitlé was already on the stand of the defendants when it turned out that it was able to increase the effect of some antibiotics, antihistamine, anxiety suppression, heart rhythm control and nervous system to a toxic level.
KOCCATE NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT - Two years ago the Italian Pharmaceuticals Institute made the news public in its official publication and also warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-administration and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO CSAK GRAPEFRUIT - Researchers say that orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances that inhibit the absorption of graphefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
This is what Michele Carruba, professor at the Medical Department of the University of Milan, points out: “This kind of discovery is usually immediately indicated by various national and international pharmaceutical agencies, who, if necessary, will ensure that they change the data contained in the information provided in that medicine.
That is why we should always read the information on the intended medication and, if something is not understandable, let us not let ourselves be influenced, but we should clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist,\" said the specialist at the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Economic Prize
The US Paul Krugman received the Economic Nobel Prize for analysing the territorial links between commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesisian Krugman, Princeton University, and his well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the best critics of economic and foreign policy measures in the Bush Government.
After the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman indicated in the new York Times that the last event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of twin towers.
This forecast was not a little debate, it has been put to the eyes of the economist in many cases, but today we know it was accurate.
“I am surprised and a little shocked that the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom has gone beyond public interest, ” said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman, a high-value economist, while quite aggressively spreading his criticisms of the over-liberalism of the Bush Government.
Open Office, third edition of the anti-Microsoft package
Today, the open code application package that increases the personal productivity of OpenOffice.org 3.0, which aims to provide an ever wider range as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from free-to-air users to public administration.
After almost a year of work supervised by SUN Microsystem and carried out by volunteer developers, the new Open Office makes a number of new appearances to the public: in addition to the welcome screen and the rethinked, less spontaneous user interface, it also offers a number of essential innovations. For example, the compatibility of Apple Mac OS X with the operational system and supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to the Office 2007 compatibility, so the Open Office can also open new extended Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It is interesting to have a specific feature of some modules, such as which allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful in sending files via email. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into a graphical module by holding site layout.
You can also create PDF documents on this interface that combine the typical Adobe format with the table editor or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also been developed through a number of improvements: the desktop manager supports the joint use of working books, but prevents the overdoing of each other's works. All employees' comments are marked with different colours, which will help you to understand at the check-in phase.
Some companies already work to make OpenOffice a few features available on the Internet (on the cloud) so that the final version can probably be presented in the next few weeks.
The Italian version, after you have been added to your English site since Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html
The software package is also available for Linux other than the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can take the installation CD either at our home or at our workplace on request.
In terms of the spread of home application, it is probably the most attractive thing to do, but the Open Office software package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector as it can expect many administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, advice and services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
The Open Office consists of five key modules: Writer, text editor corresponding to Word; Calc, table manager intended to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, Access database manager; and eventually Draw is the graphical module.
The 2008 target is to achieve 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that we are already at 3.600,000 with the release of the new version, this figure will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, this is already the fourth doping issue.
At the last stage of Tour de France again produced a positive sample of the Austrians Bernhard Kohl, competing in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, who, in addition to the bronchial ceremony, also won the best mountain trip.
The news was on the website of the Equipe Internet.
The 26-year-old Kohl, after the fourth racer, the Italian Riccardo Ricca and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German Gerolsteiner contestant Stefan Schumacher, who produced positive results from the Cera test in the third generation version of EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like the tests in the last few weeks, has been tested by the laboratories inlausanne-i and Chatenay-malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, Austria will lose its third place and will be prohibited from competing for two years in accordance with the rules.
The news on the positive outcome of Kohl's third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and the Associated Press news agency: he indicated the positive doping results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians have managed to be behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also to win the best mountain trip.
What about NEW YORK?
Only recently, from Italy’s country of migrants, he has become one of the popular targets of immigrants who have been exposed to the seizure.
The New York Times, based on the case of Abdul William Guibre in Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits, is dedicated to a long article about racism in Italy.
The case is well described as the paradox of New York Times, called: “The strongest is integration in the northern regions and the highest is employment – at the same time the support of immigration and the Northern League is also the strongest in the country.
In support of the growing tension between the Italians and immigrants, the NYS also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new legislation required by the League, which would strengthen the lawnmower in relation to immigration, and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, was set as an example of the changes in the mood in Italy.
The said trend was highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Naplestano met with XVI Bened at the Quirinale Palace and stated that the state and the Church were working together to combat racism.
Students suffer from expensive rental fees or a room of up to 900 euros
The market for accommodation granted to universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the Association of Persons, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now reached an amazing size, which, due to the total cost to families, is closing a wide range of students from learning opportunities, ” explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office of Sunia. “In these cities, high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general mirage process has been launched against local residents.
In the majority of cases, real estate offers include a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts with no lease limit, linked subcontractors.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed which, through the review of the tax system, will provide an opportunity to maximise prices.
The survey details show that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, they will also receive 450 euros for a bed; the price for a single room is EUR 650 (about the Bande Nere) up to EUR 800 (La Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can also reach 900 euros (area of Vittoria).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of EUR 350/400, a room of about 700.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in a nearby area, a bed costs 250/280 euros if they are double and EUR 370-500 when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), a single person and 450 are requested for a bed in a two-person room.
They are somewhat cheaper (550 euros a single room) around the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
In the suburbs, you can save everything: 300 euros costs a bed and 450 one-bedroom in Prnestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, you will be asked for 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price is highest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are also lower in absolute terms, but they represent more weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: rent charged to foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the cities have sacrificed the time of the old cinema halls
Traditional movies lock in favor of the Multiplexes.
“A city where there are no cinemas, a blind city, like a face without eyes, ”
The images produced by director Giuseppe Tornatore show effectively all that takes place in large Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The banning of the cinema - the emergence of a large multi-thermal fashion in the suburbs, and the subsequent distribution of single-series in urban centres - an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time, it bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, “it's like a friend who's gone away, a friend we shared our journey with and many experiences, ” says director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which, 20 years ago, reported Oscar's prize and the grand prize of the Cannes festival's Tornator, tells the story of a small-town cinemal lyria, the craving, after a movie that may have lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data provided by Anec, is clearly mentioned: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas closed.The biggest loss was recorded in the cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is one of the most affected regions, which lost 82 single-term cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that, for their disappearance, the coupling of multiplexes is nothing more than the highest number of new multi-thermal cinemas in Italy's three regions: in the last five years, the number of halls in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same way in Emilia-Romagna has risen by 195.
“The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally, ” says the President of Anec, Paolo Protti. “It is important that we build new facilities, but we should also ensure that those already in existence are survived, because when a city cinema is closed, not all the users are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the uncharged financial funds for the support of operators: the State's overcharge is about EUR 10 million.
It is also a disgrace from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
In order to maintain the market, between €16 million and €18 million would be needed –
This is the first Italian city that has decided to address the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost single-term cinemas in the city and downtown.
The provisions would include tax reductions for operators and the benefits to the public to facilitate access: viewers can park in restricted zones and in certain parking spaces.
“I do, ” says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna, even by introducing other measures.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas will be able to take up the fight with the rule of multiplexes and improve the quality of voice and image, because today's audience is much more demanding.
Protecting the traditional cinema was always an important question for me: closing the Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth age, gave me the spark that led me to do the Cinema Paradiso after all, even though I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the via Nazionale before the closed rialto or Quirinale, so I don't see the plates that were blacked from the dust, I'd rather turn my head away.
I've been arrested by the mayor of Gioia Tauro between politics and 'ndrangheta.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro has supported the interests of the Piromodel clan in municipal decisions.
Serious accusations were made against the judges of the anti-Calabrian Anti-Maffic Directorate Gioia Tauro and his civil servant, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested for external participation in criminal acts this morning.
Bilincs was taken into the hands of Gioacchino Piromodel, a senior intermediary between the clan and the administration, and a lawyer named after the boss, who was formerly convicted of being involved in mafialike criminal acts, and a compensation of EUR 10 million was imposed on him.
“Absolute any legal or moral rule, more of which is good taste, ” states state prosecutors. The two local authorities announced their intention to pay a consultant’s fee to Piromodel’s lawyer.
“So the clan would have officially entered the city hall, which would have given additional opportunity to control and manage the administration, which could already be significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the General Assembly of the region of Calabrian, does not hide that there are “a number of collusions between local institutions and organised sub-worlds ”: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than anywhere else where the collusion is not necessarily inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, resist the pressure of 'ndranghet,' they are the heroes who remain clean,
This morning's arrests are the continuations of July events, when the police announced that they were able to decapitate the Piromodel clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. In 1991, the municipal committee of Gioia Tauro was already disbanded, even because of the alleged concentrations between organized crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic Mayor of disbanding, took the lead in the second round of 2006 in the middle-right coalition.
He called out a scandal when County House ordered the decommission of the municipal committee.
He referred Marco Minnini to the court before the former Minister of Home Affairs and accused Marco Minnini of designing everything with political intent. But the court stated in the arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromodel clan was willing to demand that the A3 project be changed.
From a hearing with Dal Torrion, it is clear that state prosecutors - that it was “objective to meet the demands of an undertaking representing a large group, knownly close to the Piromodel family, and to subscrib the decisions of the municipality to the clan interest -
Energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
An inexhaustible source of energy, which accounts for 70 percent of the planet's surface, and which is yet to be discovered by large international energy companies.
Hullams, sea currents, floods, and renewable energy, to which giants have turned their eyes like Chevron, who are now trying to shake their hands.
They've been looking for the possibility of getting energy out of the sea's movements for hundreds of years. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, the research has increased.
Around 1980, when oil prices decreased, the idea of using marine energy was misinterpreted, but today the rise in environmental requirements and oil prices is giving the industry a new impetus.
According to the 2007 World Energy Council (WEC) in London, 15 percent of the world's electricity demand could be covered by marine wave facilities.
This amount is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, the currents and floods would still be there.
The giants are on the plane.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and in 2005 signed an agreement on a power plant in North Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
It's been two years since, and more and more companies are taking advantage of marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy so far.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies and considering the possibility of cooperating with us, ” reported the spokesperson of one of the American oil giants’ joint ventures on the Wall Street Journal of the Economic Day.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of the authorisation for the launch of the sub-project for the exploitation of marine energy, issued by the US Energy Committee.
It is not a small matter, especially if we consider that the US is currently in Alaska, and even recently President Bush has launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc and Ocean Power from New Jersey are the way out of the sea.
The technology is waiting for you to work out.
Experts believe that it is still an initial technology, even because energy from the sea does not dispel concerns about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as Portugal or Scotland, are small and therefore do not cause too much problems for the ecosystem.
In order to generate more energy, there is a need for facilities with a higher environmental impact.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a interlinked boron system.
The blows generated by the waves and moving up and down the ankles are converted into hydraulic pressure by the plungers and cylinders placed in them.
Pressure is a turbine that feeds a generator.
The electric current reaches the ground on cables under the sea.
At the same time, there are four similar types of installations in the planning phase that are waiting for only federal licenses. Part of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started power production for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using six sub-sea turbines located in the East River Seatime of New York.
At a flood, water movement spins over turbine shovels, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that he had a long list of partners waiting for the necessary permits to use energy.
It's a flood after the flutters.
At present, there is a need to pay particular attention to the potential for price shock.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the current is more predictable than wind, sun or waves, it is considered as a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008 on the exploitation of energy supplied by the flood, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
