Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing direct political discussions with the Eastern Ukrainian separatists.
This moment's leadership in Kiev does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who are said to be assisted by the Russian army in Kiev and the West, tried to push the Ukrainian troops further away from their spot in which Putin said that the Ukrainian army were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militant fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so as not to allow them to shoot the people of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi Center.
It surprised me that the people came from the very beginning.
Visitors were expected over the last two days. Promotor Tom Kangas tells us.
For the third time, the Seinajoki Hiphop Festival was organized.
Next year.
We are going to continue to be hiphop painters, i.e. poppies are not allowed, Kangas assures us.
On Tuesday, Finland enters into force the law restricting the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must seek permission from the Police Government to buy or retain substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassiumchlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the prescribed concentration is exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in cleaning and washing materials, but the concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane, for example, is used in the acceleration period.
However, substances obtained prior to the entry into force of the Law may be maintained and used until 2 March 2016.

Valolioliga: Super Raheem laistist - Mario remained shadowed - Valolioliga - Ilta-Sanos
Only 19 years old Raheem Sterling showed me why he is considered to be the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when Mario Balotelli confirmed Liverpool arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Marion’s first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian-made field working at a very different position than in Manchester City.
Balotel was still a long way from his top stream.
The Italians lost three high-quality targets and fed only half of their sixteen feeds to their own team.
The Pool carriers who have already taken the player as their favorite will look better in the future.
Liverpool-manager Brendan Rodgers put Luis Suarez on the role of Balotel in Barcelona as the second attacker for the team alongside Daniel Sturridge.
In the team's star, Raheem Sterling, instead of Balotel, pulled the middle-field diamond to pull the 3-0 win by Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19 doesn't just shine.
The Englishman, shorter than 20 cents of the Balotel, is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
The quality is not common for a player who thankss at the best on the lawn for about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
The Northern Irelandan reported after the match how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from a north-east London chair founded at Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra.
The Helsinki City Government has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next mayor of the Helsinki City Orchestra since autumn 2016.
Besides the L.A. Times, you've been asking questions about what orchestra he's taking next.
Susanna Mälkki tells me she's starting her new assignment with joy and pride.
Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country’s musical life for over a hundred years, including by presenting a large number of Sibelius music.
The orchestra has been run by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many orchestra members before.
I'm looking forward to our future cooperation, and he says.

After that, the actual pension negotiations will be continued.
In particular, the social partners have been rubbed down by the dispute about the commitment of retirement age to life expectancy.
The arrangements have promised by the autumn of the working life solution, but the latest estimate suggests that it will be produced during this week.
Scratch.
The women's volley team of volleys tripped over to the Vampulian athletes at the final training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula turned 5 to 3-2 wins of one of the stretched match.
The last batch of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead of us.
The fight was good, but in the defence game and in the pass game Vampula was slightly better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVon's hexagon was so grumpy that the 190-cent American centrete Jennifer Keddy was stuck in the back of the side.
As a senator, Sara Niemi played.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play with Johanna Pekkarisen, despite its thumbs, and formed the most powerful combination of WoVo.
The application was launched by Jenna Centralmäki to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 instalments.
The best part of the injury was a skilled Russian pastor and a libero Hillael Hämäläinen, which WoVo rolled as much as possible.
Preparing WoVo for the league will continue next week when Hämeenlinna’s HPK comes to the training camp Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the dealership at 18 p.m. at the official training game.
On Sunday, you'll meet with the sports school for a second time.

The company released its output data on Monday.
Lidli now has 142 stores in Finland, and the enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also reported that during the last financial year, taxes paid to Finland amounted to almost 14 million euros.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often fatal in the few populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and reduced access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published the video in honor of her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia are more likely to die of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers went through the patient data of over 1100 women with ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, more than five years after diagnosis.
Researcher Susan Jordan QIMR from Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in rarely populated and remote areas died more likely than women living in urban areas.
PENTION: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history seven years ago.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, at the time of diagnosis of female age, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the possibility of survival.
The probability of survival was lowest in older women and when cancer was more common at the time of diagnosis.
Women living in rare and remote areas died more likely than women living in urban areas during the study.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside of the city have a lower probability of surviving ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers that there are possible reasons for delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
\"Gynecological oncology doctors are best placed to treat this disease, and their reception is mostly in big cities,\" Jordan says.
While teleservices are becoming more widespread and the importance of distances is reduced, researchers are also proposing to increase the mobility of physicians so that patients can be treated closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients who are being treated from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, stressing that better treatment and better prevention programmes are needed.
The study funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer Association is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a family mother who lives in Gold Coast, 33 years old, Elisha Neav, was found to have malignant ovarian cancer.
The town of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the station plan for golf-parking activities in the Unity Park, located next to the hotel in Pohjahov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a position plan for the Unity Park and its nearby environment would be placed at a public service point in Osvetta.
The proposed proposal is requested to deliver opinions from the environmental committee and from the August Elyst Centre.
As a result, the city wants to allow for the continuation of the motorbike activities related to tourism in the region.
It is intended to form a park area that keeps the area between the current Unity Park and its and its river.
At present, no more than 200 motorcycles shall be allowed for the period from 15 November to 30 April.
You can also place filling points in the area for the specified part.
The new park area will also be allowed service.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the Unity Park for safari companies during wintertime.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and the contract is in force in spring 2018.
Noise-parking and design change have even been a source of intense opposition.
The residents of the neighbourhood floors have been starving, as have the vote and concerns about emissions.
However, emissions from the area have been investigated and no observations beyond the guidelines have been made.
The new equipment is even more low-emission.
As a parking lot, it is supported by the fact that if the place of departure was moved further away, the safari customers of the hotel should be carried to safari’s departures by buses, which would be estimated at 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the nearby environment of the friendship park are also sufficiently wide for the springs, better than the places presented as replacement slots, such as the east of the bridges of the Ounasjoki.
It is also good for its location to be able to expand in future, for example, the Ounaspaviljong region.
The establishment of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, which states that the aim of the city is, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas for logisticly and functionally affordable locations.
The friendship park is also marked as the starting point of motor racing, also a part of the centre’s public design, which has not yet obtained legal power.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is seen in garden shops
The decrease in the number of house owners, especially in the group of people under 35, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of gardened shops by tens of millions, when today’s young consumers reach their age in favour of the horticultural sales – the main target group of the Financial Times reported a survey by the United Kingdom’s Garden Trade Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times, only 55 per cent of the amount of money spent by houseowners are used for garden care.
The study also showed that more and more people live in very urbanised apartments with no gardens, and the garden’s size decreases when the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking place, and these factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to be about GBP 5 billion a year.
In the London major region, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the lowest per household expenditure per year for garden products in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in renting or the decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
RHS' leading garden advisor, Guy Barter, says that, for example, plants grown in transferable farming containers are particularly popular among the tenants, since such facilities can be included in their development if necessary.
According to the HTA report, between 1997 and 2005, the growing season of the resale of the garden sector was due to an increase in housing ownership and wealth from the late '80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that this year, as the weather is better, trade is worsening, after the weather in March and April last year.
Turkey is questioning a US diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on the spying by the Americans and the British in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Ambassador and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The Intercept, a German Der Spiegel magazine, has written that the documents released by the former US National Security Agency Edward Snowden revealed that Turkey was the main spy target of the US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news offices, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the significance of the report, namely that all major countries have established one another.
The previous report by Germany on the spying of the main intelligence service in Ankara caused a more angry reaction to the Turkish government.

Chief of Police Mallorcan Magaluf, accused of corruption
The evidence was provided by the police and the city government officials of Calvià for blackmail at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Calvià's chief of police on the Mallorca holiday has been arrested as a result of the corruption charges presented by the well-known Magaluf movement and bar owners.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several movementists on the Punta Ballena street presented corruption charges against him. The majority of Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located in the Punta Ballena street.
According to Mallorca Diario, the daily release newspaper, the case revealed evidence of blackmail by police officers and the city government officials of Calvià at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with the corruption charges, and they are interviewed by the judge together with Navarro.
The entire country's journal ABC wrote about the neutrality of the angry authorities of night club owners, which significantly hindered their business.
“There is no more money in it, but the survival, one of the movers stated to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in magazines headlines this summer when YouTube video was released online, where an 18-year-old British vacationer was having oral sex with 24 men in the so-called pub crawl period.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to control the drunk and uncontrollable use of Magaluf holidayers by reducing the number of participants in malignant, alcoholic pub crawlie.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral video was described, was ordered to be closed for a year, and Carnage, the owner of the night club and the organizer of the pub crawl, was ordered to pay the fines of EUR 55 000.
Above all, the tourist destination of Magaluf, popular among young British tourists, has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol abuse when people have jumped from the balcony to another or balcony in the hotel pool.
The children of Israel return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday when they spent summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and grenades were bombed by their communities in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed when the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket bombardment in the communities of southern Israel, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod in the city of Pashosh, in the south, workers removed the fragments from the walls and slides prior to the arrival of the children in the building after the day-to-day home.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re also excited, ” says Ronit Bart, who lives in the Sasat Kibbuts, the Israeli Communist, and works as an English teacher at the city’s school.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
The 11-year-old daughter of Bart, Shani Bart, said she's going back to school in a long time.
\"We've had difficult times, and we didn't go anywhere,\" he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts near the Gaza Strip for his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of Sadi’s similar border communities had remained in their homes or left their homes to safer areas from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip have doubts about the return of the Palestinian grenade killed by a four-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, the fair ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderot, near the Gaza Strip, which was the subject of a heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that the training and safety of children will be taken care of.
Israel and Hamas agreed on the ceasefire so far last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas' call for the removal of the island of Israel and Egypt and the re-opening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to take down Hamas' weapons and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to the Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of the dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although they had no solid evidence of this.
On Israel's side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including Thai workers.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities mostly in the south.
In turn, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and it was estimated that more than 100 UNs fled protective custody to a school that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in protective custody and while the battles continued, the school officials moved the beginning of the school in the previous week.
“I hope that school will soon open up and return to school, just as other children in the world and just like the Jewish children, ” said the 13 - year - old Mohammed Amara, who lives in a school in Gaza.
According to a commonly used meter, house prices have risen most to seven years during the winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings in the Australian capital city increased by 1.1% in August, showed RP data on Monday.
With this increase, during the summer, July and August prices rose by a total of 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9%, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but has not been steadily rising throughout the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
RP Data shows that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent and that in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent last year.
The housing markets for Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are now the most robust; the average price rise is from 5 to 6 %.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4% per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawlessss, the early springs in Australia have started to increase the number of dwellings in sales over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
\"In view of the increase in the sales of auctioned dwellings, the generally lively sales rate and the continued low interest rate, it is likely that the increase in housing prices will continue in the next three months,\" says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences from Mänttä
The new museum and image art have drawn record audiences this summer from Mäntä.
The Serlachius Art Museum has visited over 70,000 visitors by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there have been, among other things, classical works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On Monday, Mänttä’s film week reported that he had a visitor’s record, while the surprise event was of 14 500 interest this summer.
These figures are not used.
The people have been strangled by doors and windows, says Pauli Sivonen from Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors for the whole year will come to the Serlachius museums this year to bring about a hundred thousand.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
There are about 11 000 inhabitants in Mäntta-Vilpula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä.
The museum director, Sivonen, reminds us that new museums are always opening up phenomena.
The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent, he says.
In Mäntä, it is hoped that the age of art will continue far over the summer.
In autumn the art museum will open new exhibitions.
The police are investigating the theft of the past four days in Kajaan.
On Sunday night at the Pohjolankadu, the commercial property was broken by breaking the window.
The killer had received a small amount of money from the cash machine.
Between Thursday and Monday, there was fuel stolen from the tank of the truck in the Deep Street.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, a boat had been taken from the boat’s boat to its engines.
The rowing boat was a Kalapalta-marked outdoor light, and it was floating inside.
In the interior, read the text “OIVA” on the nostril side
A couple of suspects stealing the police were already able to catch it.
Sunday night at Tikkapuronti, the commercial property was broken.
The police dog got a trace, and a 20-year-old paltamo man was found in the woods hiding under a tree.
On Monday, the police caught another man from Palota, who is also suspected to have committed the same breach.
Lost amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan.
The disappearance of amphetamine batch nearly ten grams resulted in a murder charge for a Cayan man born in 1977.
According to the D.A., the man had gone to the apartment with his co-conspirator and another man and shot the drug exporter with a shotgun, a 34-year-old Cayan woman who had suspected of being a drug exporter.
The defendant objected to the charge and claimed to be the shooter of another man with him.
The case came to the police's attention when the police department stopped the passenger car where the company had been burning clothes used for blood work.
In addition to the burnt coats, there was a cut shotgun in the car.
The District Court of Kainuu will give the judgment later.
August was rare in many places.
According to the Air Science Department, August as warm as it is, on average, repeats once every 10 years.
From the statistics of the Finnish Institute of Air Science, it appears that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than normal.
Most of the country's deviation was one to two degrees.
In July and August, the summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature in the whole summer was measured in Pori, the first week of August, where the meter looked at 33.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in a family of seven children born in Jamaica in Dudley, England in the Midlands region of 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and Henry died when he was 19.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on his father's imaginary discussion and is developed on the basis of a radio 4 channel series.
The sound track is a mix of rreggat and rappies in upbeat paces.
Henry's had to go through some bad childhood memories.
He has been in therapy many times since his mother died, and he is reflecting much on his relationship with his father.
My father was very hard to read.
His face was never seen, just a voice said, \"Stop talking.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the croquet.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer cake or the beauty of a croquette.
I never talked to him about things like that.
Most of my life he was to me that smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal alloy in Dudley and thus got the idea of what his father's life must have been, even though working conditions are better now than at that time.
The salamats are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoke-like, Labyrinth-like depths, where they feed on flames, smokes and beaks and bring back to mind the soul.
My father used to go to a bath and just lay in a tub, and slowly he started singing to himself when he washed out the dirt of the melting plant himself.
As I walked around the quarry, I realized that he had been doing this job for years to get us food, and I began to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry's childhood was lacking in the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother started to get sick a little before she died, we started to get to each other and love each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love she loved as a child.
Do you have to say it all the time? I love you.
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's still a good friend of mine with French, who he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to her mother's death.
When I started suffering from excessive overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to exercise much, and I also had to start a tough diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard may be a picture of his change during his career development.
When critics get a lot of good feedback about their role in Othello, he's stuck in making the theater.
The next turn was the Erehdyste comedy and August Wilson's Fences-Dads.
Making the theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedys Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the field when he was only 16 years old.
One of the dishes noticed her doing impressions on the stage and contacted the New Faces Skills Competition.
Henry's TV career started in the mid-70s. How long have I been the only black copycat and comedy on TV?
Henry learned the job when he was doing it.
I was supposed to grow up in the light of publicity, I had to learn how to produce jokes from slippers between 1975 and 1985, while living was a star and I was on television. It was a difficult time.
At Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black dresses, so Henry ended up in a comic program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I'd never been involved in it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and atrocious, I was able to work in huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet, the award, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program of the Britttian-tv was at the same time an exciting parade of black people.
Henry worked in the '80s in the second comedy series, where both were made a joke and black British culture was admired.
The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known as a cook Gareth Blacklock as a comedy chef!
Henry spent the next decade with ads, documents, TV series and movies, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in 2008 at the BBC, he said to himself: \"What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems that the paths are only on your spot or on the sidelines –
The next item was the Radio 4 document series “What's So Great About... ”.
The first part covered Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not properly taught in our school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that uses stockings and has money.
That's why I was scared about Shakespeare.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nun, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: \"Look at me.
Don't give up the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet the words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 of Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
\"This is what this is about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn from your verse, do a little background study.
So the exercise process was tough and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Soon thereafter, Henry played the main part in the Erehdy comedy comedy.
All of a sudden, I was acting at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, I was thinking, \"Oh, you've changed,
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that his task was to entertain the audience.
\"A small voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to go through 10 minutes alone until the computer is back on track.'
Instead, the director announced that the presentation would be continued as soon as the problem had been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me felt like relief.
It's not my responsibility,
I can leave it to others.
You're part of the play, you're part of the role.
The Henry-Fences show at the Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to learn the mountains.
Panic is a good thing. It makes a person more sustainable.
This play, too, was well received, so it was like a sign of the gods;
This is what Henry says, of course, with a voice.
So I decided to stick around.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still essentially a comedian: the little humorous boys are constantly interrupting our conversation when he switch from impression to one another.
Staying off the Stand-up committee is a matter of will, as getting immediate thanks to the unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you're always thirsty for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but generally it does not inspire me in the same way as before.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on a new stand-up tour.
I'm happy to sit with the director who helps to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up on that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The play keeps telling the story, and I enjoy doing it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is making a register of officials to remove the ghost workers.
Kenya has started to create a biometric register of officials trying to remove the ghost workers from the government's pay list.
Workers who did not register in the next two weeks should no longer be paid, the government statement announced.
The government has doubts that thousands will still be paid after having left their official duties.
President Uhuryetta promised to cut down public sector corruption after entering office in 2013.
According to the audit carried out earlier this year, there were at least a million dollars spent in the month on the pay and other financial abuse.
The government has doubts that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or has left office, the BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reports about the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials should report themselves to the register over the next few weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data are stored in biometric registration format, reported in the government's notice.
According to the press, anyone who leaves this without due cause will be removed from the list.
This measure makes the public sector much more rational, as it defines how many people actually work for their duties, and also cleans wage lists at the government's two levels, which solves the problem of the ghost workers, says Anne Waiguru, the office of the Ministry of Decentralization and Design.
The results of the financial year 2015 may remain EUR 25,5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and its expenditure developments in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current draft budget, the annual budget is about 9.4 million in deficits.
As a possible means of improving efficiency, the scope and level of service was reduced, as well as the purchase of services, the sale and grant of property, and the increase in tax and tax returns.
The EUR 10 million target for investment is 8.5 million.
There is no guarantee of relief for municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, inadequate increases in tax revenues, increased unemployment and a 5% cut in state shares will further weaken the prospects.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to look for new ways of balancing the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into a strategy objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Government.
The City Government also recalled the presentations made for the preparation of the Governing Board.
The city government's proposals are based on the preparation of the budget at the council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the Council seminar, the draft budget will proceed through the board’s treatment to the City Council and the City Council.
Tens of them arrested by Turkish police as suspects against the government.
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey, suspected of plots against the government, and local media sources tell us.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some of the police had been involved in the corruption investigations conducted last December involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July several police officers were arrested in Turkey for organising large-scale crime and monitoring of telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (who acted as Prime Minister during that period) said that police activities are part of the planned action of the Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen and others.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditional day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatseyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting journalists that not all schools had opened up again, but he said he was committed to defending the country for generations to come:
The first day of September ceremony was not spent in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must be fought for peace.
Aleksandan Pastetkhov, who acts as a leading teacher at the Slaviansky school, where Yatsynuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children can learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school are traditionally written children’s shirts, balloons, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Texas Perry, the twiit that was delicious was unbridled.
On Sunday night the Texas Governor Rick Perry was sent out of his confirmed Twitter account, a dazzling image of the democratic district attorney in the middle of this hearing of the accusations of abuse of power.
Tweet was removed later, followed by a new tweet where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweetti was unauthorised to be sent from my account.
- I don't accept the check and I've removed it, the later release said it.
Perry's backup troops did not respond immediately to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the photo.
The first twiit included a delicious prank of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of a DU in April 2013.
Perry prevented Lemberg's office from financing when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for 2016 presidential elections.
The title of Tweet was: \"I don't always get drunk, three times allowed by bigger barges... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry on pointing his finger at him.
I'm the drunkest democratic in Texas.
The Lemberg Office did not conduct a major jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antioch, ordered by the Republican judge.
Perry says he's innocent and called charges as a political plot.
His influential Legal Assistance team has asked the judge to reject the accusations and said that the law under which the governor who was most badly in Texas is accused of being accused is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state aid for a public inviolability unit operating in Travis County and to deal with public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision resulted in an official complaint by the left-hand follow-up team.
Perry's confirmed Twitter Account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa Election Conference during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to stop playing the tie by publishing a text on Twitter on the self-fed lake – here comes South Carolina.
And, according to Berkeley, the housing market is back to normal.
One of London's most important builders has warned us that the housing market in South-East England has returned to normal levels of activity.
The capital of London's apartments have been affected by huge demand and a sharp increase in prices while fearing a broad spread of credit, which allowed the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Mr Pidgley, founder and chairman of the High Level Builder Berkeley, said on Monday that, since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal after the peak in 2013 and added that this has enabled a more stable operating environment.
During the recession in London's housing market, foreign investors went to the capital by herds.
According to the land register data, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus significantly exceeded the average of 6,7 per cent in England and Wales.
The average sales prices of the individual, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley increased by about one fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of GBP 423 000 by the end of April.
However, the increased weight has made London a less attractive object in recent months - some of its interest has also been influenced by new real estate tax and political rhetoric on possible - mapanon tax - before the general elections in May.
Last week, Mr Foxtons, London's real estate agent, warned that the April mortgage report on tighter lending orders would lead to lower market growth, both in terms of sales volumes of real estate and prices in the second half of the year.
On Monday, the recent data from the Bank of England showed that the number of loans accepted decreased in July, suggesting cooling housing markets.
The real estate agent, Hamptons International, has calculated its 2015 forecast of London's real estate prices. It is estimated that prices will fall by three per cent because the index of housing owners' opinion on prices has already started to decline.
The number of shops made in London's most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair andkensington has fallen in the fourth quarter of the year, the real estate broker WA Ellis reports.
However, domestic demand in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased income from sold properties to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that the well-designed demand for the right product has remained stable in the best positions and, therefore, sales have remained strong.
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than at the time of the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual profits before taxes thus increased by 40 per cent year-on-year to GBP 380 million and net sales increased by 18 per cent to EUR 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley reported that the earnings of the year at Berkeley reflect the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before tax for the whole year is GBP 450 million.
In the afternoon, at the London Stock Exchange, the share of Berkeley sold at a steady price of £23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked images online.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards event.
A hacker who claims to hold hundreds of other reasons leaked pictures of Oscar's infested internet.
The hunger-free representative confirmed that the images are genuine and condemned the hacker’s bold privacy violation.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will get the charges.
The images that were originally published on the 4chan photo publication page had apparently ended in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple iCloud download system. Due to the remaining number of female characters, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Cate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the images are real, though Scott Pilgrim versus the World Star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
For those who look at pictures of me and my husband in the privacy of my home years ago, I hope you have a good mind, Winstead.
However, Victoria Justice, the Nickolodeon and the Victorious series, denied the authenticity of the images, and I think that these so-called nudity images of me are a failure to understand...
Let me put an end to this right now.
The BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
The only thing we have to do is take Howard Jacobson's thank-you for the new novel he's got saying about love and j-book.
They slipped, it pictured the best of what happened, gradually leaving each other like a box of cardboard left out in the rain.
Only once in a while did he hear from the woman that she was too serious, too severe, intensive, disengaged, and perhaps also a little bit lenient.
That's when he threw his hand.
He recognized a little bit of it.
Yeah, he was a little bit much like a silhouette.
His last victim was at an early stage of a relationship which, however, had been promising; it seemed that this relationship could have facilitated his loneliness, and it might have brought up to some content of his life.
Solomons had unsatisfied hair, and he was a tenderly tender beauty with a happy heart, a village in the north, which was even more bearer and further away than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling partner, which Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriate to the Paradise Valley.
There was no one in the house for years.
The pipes were leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the ethanols had left their tracks on the windows, keeping the whole place on their own, there were weeds growing in the garden, which reminded them of the giant cabbages.
The cabin was like a rain of children, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
Reported by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel \"J\" is on the terms of the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The candidates will be published next week
Kevern had sat in hand with Ailin in a broken steel chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both listening decentrally to the reception, through which the whole country heard calm music and calming news, when Ailin’s crucified legs brought Kevern’s mind to mind, a song that had long been forgotten about the black performer, and which his father had often listened to the dunes of the cabin at the bottom.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive, and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was actually prohibited – they were no longer played.
They wanted to leave it behind, just like the word unhola itself.
The public opinion brought about what was not achieved by law and proclamation: just as people in the corner of literature chose to read the memoirs of heroes, cookbooks, and novels, for music, they favor Ballads.
Kevern started to pick up an imaginary piano and sings serenadia for Ailin's big feet with a loud coma.
I didn't understand.
It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller, Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was how his father always did before he could get away from his lips in a book.
It had started as a game between him and his father while he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let a word start with your mouth j, and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't even now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
I had never heard such a thing before.
Neither was Jazz declared banished, but it was not just called.
The improvisation wasn't in the fashion anymore.
There was only room for one word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same way for Noah.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10 years, jazz music had become familiar with him through his father's half-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Alilinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailin, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or sanctions here either.
Hearing society meant that each of its parts was grateful for the fact that they had saved themselves as a happy trade, the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperature and physical characteristics, the people of the Afro Caribbean family are best suited to entertain and play, so they sing and run.
Originally, those from India’s continent were like natural gifted with electrical equipment, so it was their job to ensure that every family had a working phone that was used to handle matters.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as pipelines; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When SE, WHAT THE TAPAHTUI, AS TOWN, came to the truth, they were from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled smoothly in the fear that they would be charged with the escalating of flames and feared that they would reach them next, opened up restaurants serving the Labneh Yogurt and burned the water pipe, and continued their lives looking in the ground created and depressed.
Everyone will act according to their gifts.
Alin had only heard Ballades, and he was hard to understand how the offensive words just sang by Kevern had never been made to dress up as music.
The music used to express love.
They're not really offensive, Kevern said.
Except maybe the bigfoots think so.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion for safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant calf leaves.
I still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers on his lips with Ailin.
I thought she was weird already.
- My father thought it was amusing, but he said instead.
He had his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing else to see in the whole world than Ailin's huge, flash of hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
If you say so, he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But it doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
It seemed like I was really confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, \"I love you, but it was still too early for that.
You're attractive to me because of your fat ankles, and he was trying to fix the situation.
I've been twisted in that sense.
This wasn't helping.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to make fun, the effect was completely different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
In spite of her gentle eyes.
At the same time, Solomons was reddished and rose from his steel chair and poured the receiver and poured the wine that they had just had been drinking.
The wine was made of just a vulture, so he couldn't use it as a cause of coercion.
In her nervousness, she seemed to shake like palm trees in a storm.
And your thick head is the one that will be attracted to me in you, and he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words, and for the fear he saw in his eyes when he decided to stand against him.
Did Alilin think she'd hit him?
He had never told Kevern about his life in the wild northern islands where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that basically it was the same as life here.
It's the same huge, wild sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even more pale and diabolical than their smugglers and dispersal parents, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who dares to resist or giggling them.
Fat head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
First, suck – kissing had become the most common word for a man and woman's erotic encounter; the counter counter countering the meaningless love ballads – first suck and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much too, because it was already hostile in itself.
I thought Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself up from a steel chair like an old man.
He also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's sorrow surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
He was followed by a man who himself was responsible for his heavy life, just as Kevern’s traveling companion watched the departure from the window upstairs.
Adam's leaving the garden, he's thinking.
He felt pity for Keverni and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who had turned his back, round, shameful, beaten, had lost all the will of the battle – why did he feel that this vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he would have seen such things once before this moment?
When Alilinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years prior to the described event intelligent and zealous 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the public mind in Offnow, made a short study of the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in areas where violence is reduced, or the end was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
“A lot has already been achieved, and much remains to be done, ” he wrote, “that can be offset for thousands of years by his struggle and most often the natural aggression of the anointed people, especially in those abandoned and remote coves, where, despite church towers across the bushes, human amplitude is rarely known at the time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower its desires are.
The people cry with sentimental Ballads, hordes of anointed conflicting stories and swears in the name of virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps an unsatisfied grip on both rural communities and urban co-dwelling areas, and there is also evidence of a new, more inhospitable conflict in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
- You have a unfortunate tendency to dramatize, his director commented after reading the whole report.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask myself, are you an atheist?
I don't think I have to answer that, Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to his court not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
“I’m not asking, ” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianity and feminism.
There are no prejudices at this workplace.
We are servants of an unbridled society.
Although a certain kind of hypersensitivity is acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, to what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or evil spirit, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
It's like yesterday, if it happened at all, it's destroying the country's fundamental vital vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when Rabinowitz talked.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, Flamingonvale-red LED light declared the direction that Offnow had given to the country in the previous quarter or more.
Smile to your neighbor, value your partner, listen to the Ballades, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than quiet, and the song is better than writing, but nothing can win the love.
“I understand very well what you would like to say, ” Esme Nussibaum replied with a quiet voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, and I just want to say that we are not as efficient as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that initially led to SITHEN, WHAT TO DO.
This time, though, we will not pour out our hatred and distrust in others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
\"You're going too far,\" he said, \"in your description of 'false' actions that our grandparents may have done or have not done.
You're going too far to say that they've shed their hate and distrust.\"
A position like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no \"we\" or \"other\".
It was chaos, that's all we know about it.
If we're quite honest, in that chaos, Esme dared to continue, no group of society can say that he's behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What they did was good or bad.
That's when it was.
That is all we need to talk about – we agree on.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make adjustments, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But for what your past will exist if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
\"I'm going through your report,\" he said, \"It was time for Esmen to leave.\"
The next day he was going to work as usual, and he was hit by a motorbike on the sidewalk, described by the passers of which he described as evil-spring and rage.
There are accidents.
Lesotho's army will deny the attack; the Prime Minister will remain in South Africa
Lesotho's military officials have banned the attack on the government's attack and said that they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and took over government buildings in the capital city of Maserus.
The Head of State traveled with his family to a neighbouring country in South Africa after telling him that he had been killed.
The military representative, Major Ntle Ntoi, denied the attack and said that the army responded to the threat that came from \"political fanatics\". The police have said that they have tried to weaponize fanatics.
\"Lesotho's defence forces took action after receiving multiple intelligence reports that certain police forces are trying to weaponize young party fans when they were ready to cause problems,\" he told the Voice of America News Office.
According to President Clayson Mosela, South African Government, the military activities seemed to be a revolution.
\"Although no one has claimed that they have abused the government by force, the action by the Lesotho Defence Forces seems to be a sign of the corresponding revolution attempt,\" he says.
According to the Lesotho army officials, soldiers return to their troops on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that action is targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane interrupted parliamentary sessions due to the differences between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies the government's power, although it is argued otherwise.
Trade magazine: Microsoft to set up a data center for New Country
Microsoft, the IT company, has established a large data center for New Zealand, where the company does not agree to specify its location.
According to Microsoft Media, the company notes that it does not tell all its data centers about security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the Centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's for Microsoft to invest hundreds of millions of dollars.
In public, Oulu or Kajan had previously been beaten.
Microsoft will stop completely at Oulu's office, which will take about 500 people to work.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will fire up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft's communication director, tells the STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data center employs.
The creation of the Data Centre to the New Zealand was reported on Monday by the Market Journal.

Four tips for better watery images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, you will have several different device options to choose from.
The preferred option is waterproof, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both paying about $300.
I myself took these photos at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than 350 dollars.
Whatever the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device two times.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed watertightly.
In addition, set the camera's description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras, or combinations of camera and video camera, have a regulation to optimise the description conditions under water.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can be taken.
Some cameras last only 5 feet in depth, others up to 50-60 feet in depth.
Take a look at the usual and watery models in our shopping guide and the reviews of the digital cameras.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
The compact cameras have a LCD display that allows you to convert images, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see under water, and sequencing a picture can either succeed or fail.
So take a lot of pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows scratching, which means taking several images at a time by different settings, you will benefit from this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when describing the pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less the colors you see.
Try getting close to the target.
This is an important advice when describing the land, but even more important under water because the light conditions are limited.
It is very important when you have an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of image, i.e. the camera must be close to the target to meet the entire image's frames.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protestors swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters would not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections despite the growing peacelessness of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong Business quarter after the activation of activists to plan and implement demonstrations only hours after the publication of the decision.
In practice, the decision of the People's Congress of China to give the Communists power to eliminate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
\"This was expected, but it's still an agitating,\" says President of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with a sovereign government.
Li Fei, Vice-President of the Committee of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general candidate for the choice of Hong Kong leader would be too 'lost'.
From 1997 onwards, the United Kingdom, when it handed down Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017.
According to the Chinese leaders, the Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process strictly through the appointing committee, which will be managed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who love the country and love Hong Kong will be accepted.
During the summer preceding the decision, some of the biggest and most important protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
Behind the campaign to defend democracy, there was largely Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organisers have threatened to prevent the functioning of the business world block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement met in front of Hong Kong headquarters.
In the demonstration, business organisers announced that the movement was moving to a new era of civil society independence and that they would achieve protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not explain the details apparently, fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
When published in the network, the organisers said that the movement considers the Occupy Central to be the last means, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way.
We are very sorry to announce that today's last chance for dialogue has been removed and the centralisation is taking place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday the security measures were close to the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, there is a sense of unrest that many people are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s living conditions – the business world.
“The report they are talking about can lead to major financial losses depending on how many people take part and how long it last, ” says the legislator Regina Ip, who has long been criticising the movement.
We don't want Hong Kong to get out of our way.
Such an image would be a bad idea to invest.
There are also stories in the Chinese state that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the palms of the Western powers that are plaguing the revolution.
This summer, activists held a referendum on informal voting rights involving 780 000 people – more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the biggest demonstrations that favour democracy in the region.
Your American promotion is hitting the universities in Britain: new students have a private life
We are looking forward to the demand by setting up the first class of luxury travel in Britain for students today.
The company also offers other vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure the customer’s ability to make the most of his visit to the university.
Stewart says there's also a safety aspect of the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country, in loaded cars.
When combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are prepared to offer students today the easiest and high-quality transportation possible.
According to the company representative, no bookings have yet been made since the service was just set up, but added that students will start ordering during the next few weeks.
The company believes that there is demand for the service, even though most students pay $9 000 per academic year.
Today's students are very different from their expectations and wishes from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it's more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Organization for Higher Education, this service plan seems to be really far away from the life of the student majority.
Many of these months of study begin to shake off the level of living costs when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been left behind by a huge increase in basic food costs.

Bulgarian prison staff holding a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers around Bulgaria expressed their views in front of the Ministry of Justice of the capital of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared their desire to return to the old provisions on employment that were recently amended.
There is also a need to discuss wage increases with Mr Hristo Ivanov, the temporary Minister of Justice.
For a month, prison officials have been symbolicly protesting against new working hours, saying that they want to return to the old 24-hour duty system.
Despite the meeting between the prison workers' organisation and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice, there was no agreement, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are currently under way, Mr Zhezazkov, director of the Directorate-General for the Implementation of the Judgments, told BNR.
The protest of the prison workers' organisations is also expected to be linked to members of the Ministry of the Interior's trade union.
Cartoon: Fans promotion almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainting on the field
The basketball Sasu Salin was today a vulture of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget his hearty U.S. fight and set back the other half of Ukraine's blood with a standing solution.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolves and did it in style:
I was going to pass out on that field at the end, and that suit was so awesome.
In my eyes, but in my eyes, there was nothing.
The noise and the white general was almost too much for me.
Salin’s power times included nine surfaces in a quick pace, a ball of balls, a record of plates, and a brick of a place where it happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode that made it all work.
They're coming from something, right now, the most important place, Sasu glowed.
It's my role.
Do all that.
Now it was great to see that everyone else got caught up in the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team's evaporator and spirit class, so it is no wonder that his example brought the whole team into a flight that was too much for the big and hard-bodied Ukraine's five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of break: A serious jubilee left the former behind.
Heikki Montonen (aik.) was the head coach of Finland in Argentina's MM tournament in 1982.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team played the last time in the World Cup tournament.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach in Finland and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing as yesterday: it was in the early part a hot fight against France.
In that fight, the judge game was dirty. He remembered Kosone.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled in the back.
All of a sudden, the game was continued.
We lost it two to three, and then the shits went a little more crazy, told me Parkkali.
Finland played the main coach Heikki Montose in command and eventually settled in the 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's elections when the World Cup tournament in Poland is on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over 32 years.
Players' strength values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game's faster. Think about Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
Finland’s player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the first part.
And then you can get tight. You know, Kosonen's got a lot of judgment.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victory match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope it's 17th place now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go wrong, said Parkkali.
The species legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen, and Kari Körkkö were in the Tunisia game.
The sauna and evening charter at Buenos Aires Seaman Church were part of the national team’s program at the World Championship in 1982.
Kari Kalin stretched with his teammates.

Finnish tourists saved Cat from mountain Norway: \"These men deserve all the thanks.\"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were in trouble on Thursday on the mountains, Antti and Tuoma Soini offered a mighty hand.
The weekend, Mikkelsen's search for international heroes, on Facebook, so that he can thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelen told me in the public Facebook update that a Cita dog who was with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his ass.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on a steep ground.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried to lure and pull it a little forward many times, but its legs didn't just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help from the police, no hotel near us, no passersby.
In the dark of the evening, the situation already began to appear to be threatening.
Fortunately, there were two travelers who were willing to help: Antti Soni, from Tampere, and the Judge of his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway in Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campplace when they saw the slope of the mountain in the midst of the woman and the dog.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soni will tell East Sanom in her message.
Soon there was also a German man who had a boat with him.
I mean, they got a couple of people from Patja to Citadel, and they got a couple of people who got the hurt dog.
The German man came in for a moment after us, when we were wondering what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the front for a while, Soni says.
KOVA: Judge Soni
The dog was picked up with the help of the cruiser.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry it in a difficult country.
In about one and a half hours, however, Citadel was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for international heroes on Facebook so he could thank them once more.
So the calls answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unobtrusive.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelnen will rejoice.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
The Solons were already on their way home the other night.
They had received joys from Mikkelsen.

The indicative name of the opening period raises questions.
The most popular crop series ever in Finland, the Kaunii and the brave will return from summer break today.
The name of the return period is indicatively... of oral luck with Eric...
The evening shortage's programme description shows the following:

Genetic deviation is often misdiagnosed
A British woman was afraid of dying for years because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years of life left because he had a diagnosis of another disease.
He really suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a number of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
Charity CMT UK charity says that false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because it is known so little.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, causing symptoms of motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking, and tightness in the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms get worse over time.
While Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before completing 18 and dying before he could reach 30 years of age.
Today, 51-year-old mother of two children says that as a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and I lasted longer than anyone else.
I could never skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran in a different way than others.
While Rodgers was 13 years old, he was subjected to several surgeries to perform leg surgery. In connection with surgery from the doctor’s departure room, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA disease.
I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, when I got home, I found out about the disease in the library, and I wrote to the FA, he says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I was going to sit in a wheelchair by the time I was 18 years old and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime, I would lose all of my ability to function quietly.
I went through this to myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17 he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor was just hugging me, saying, \"Gunny girl, I don't think you have this illness because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair,\"
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
When I was explained what the CMT was, I thought I'd been suspended, he'd tell me.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to draw attention to the disease.
A hundred migrants were found in a coal wagon in Macedonia.
More than 100 illegal immigrants have been found by the Macedonian authorities on a train transporting coal, the country's Ministry of Internal Affairs reported on Monday.
Most of them were Syrians and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The settlers were found late on Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going, said Ivo Kotesski, the Ministry of Interior.
According to the police, migrants had paid some EUR 3 000 each to reach Greece, and another EUR 800-900 added to reach Serbia.
There are a lot of illegal immigrants going through Macedonia, a few million inhabitants, on their way to Western Europe.

The municipal government showed fair sportsmanship and was unanimous in its decision.

Hull washed an attacker with a record of the Hernandez Society.
The selection club Hull invested the company’s record for the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, member of the Uruguay National Team.
Hernandez exchanges Hulli’s Italian Society from Palermo with a pounds of 9.5 million, or around EUR 12 million.
It's a three-year contract.
During the last period, Hernandez struck 14 goals when Palermo won Serie B and rose to the Italian main series.
During the Uruguay National Team, he has made seven goals in 14 matches.
In last summer's World Cup, Hernandez won two fights from switching to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we've come in a short time, said Hull's head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday Hull told me that he also acquired the National Team Commander of Senegal, Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
Russian space test failed - the gays sent to sex were killed
The five small gills sent to Russia’s space are dead, reports Roscosmos, the Russian Federation’s space organization.
The Gekos were traveling by the Foton M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning during Finnish time.
The purpose of the test was to examine the reproductive capacity and use of the gecko in a weightless state.
One male sterling and four females took part in the trial.
Although the experiment sounds so special, it was meant to be serious.
For example, there is only limited knowledge of the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs.
The effect on the Gekeks can help to anticipate the impact of weightlessness on the human being in the longer-term, illustrated by New Statesman in July.
Roscosmos said that the time of death and cause or cause of death are investigated.
According to the News Office Interfax, crosses were frozen.
It is also surprising that the fruit flies that traveled on the road to Foton-M4 survived the journey and were also able to grow after them.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to have been recruited by a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed the Commission on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track a man after he had made money for a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline didn't believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alarmed the authorities.
Authorities contacted a girl's father who was completely unaware of her intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed him before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people at Iraq or Syria’s wars also pose a safety risk to France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or people in France have traveled to Syria during the last conflict, returned from there, or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
Copy: We have a good chance to win
The wishes of the basketball team’s extension point are in the game when Finland meets today in its second match with the World Cup in Ukraine.
If the opening cup had been expected for the United States, Ukraine will be part of those countries where Finland should continue to take the necessary winnings.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance to win, Petteri Koponen prognosis.
On Saturday, Ukraine won the first race in the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team is training NBA-veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine will play aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is Eugene-Pooh- Jeter, the player whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the world champion of 100 meters three years ago.
The Dominican Republic versus Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we've been played against such things before, and we have to get our standard defense right, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in its yesterday's loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you that there will be a normal wolfbed on the field, Möttölä said.
The alleged infestants of Hollywood stars spread online - some of them secured for real.
On the Internet there are a number of naked images which are said to be presented by known public authorities.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of an infestive campaign.
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of images.
This is a serious violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be put in charge, representatives will threaten.
According to TMZ, actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her are genuine.
He had taken those photos years ago with his husband.
When I know that those photos were destroyed long ago, I can only imagine what a terrible pain was seen for this.
I feel compassion for all those who became victims of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice says pictures of her own name are faked.
The real or fake images are also moving from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka painter criticized his own: \"They don't work hard enough to get out of here.\"
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Cutting League.
The comments made by the painter Walter Viitala after the Sunday VPS match are a very mixed picture of the company's current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper in four months.
But we have to adjust everything. The Fiveala said after a struggle that ended in one to two.
In the fight, Honka made a lot of defense-head mistakes, especially during the first half.
The painter Vitala wasn't in the mood for a bad defense play.
Player traffic in Hongga has been busy this summer, and for that reason the defenders in front of Viitala have changed at a high pace.
In addition to the player-offer, many young players have been given opportunities that they may not even deserve.
The guy doesn't work hard enough to get out of here sometimes, but Vitala did nothing to name any single player.
Honga's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Viitala.
After the game, I told certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun, and you think you're a playful gambler, and you don't have to work, you're probably wrong on the team,\" Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play games.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded me that players cannot expect immediate success when playing games continue to change.
During this period there have not been two consecutive consecutive stages of the same composition.
Especially on the head of defense, there's been a shift.
That's the biggest reason we're in this place. Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial idol with the second last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left, so the Espoolians still have time to avoid falling to One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop it right now.
We're definitely not going to drop out of this show, goalkeeper Vitala threatened.

Then my mother and my sisters noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be commended for first aid.
The 20-year-old British involved in a super-advised challenge was taken to a hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The video click has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The angle of the wolf’s slurry (in fact): How can the increase in fan numbers be explained?
I mean, today was a great guy.
So said basketball player Sakari Pehkone in 1995, when Finland had played in the EM final tournament against France at the Athens Marouss Balls Hall.
She didn't overdo it.
I remember the game when he was there.
So were the hundreds of Finns who shouted at 20,000 viewers, or even the noise of an empty government.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup in Finland-Ukraine?
In Bilbao, hundreds of Finnish fan troops are 80 times.
The EM contests 1995 were looking for Finnish basketball.
The men cut off their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, in the Russian Caring match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Mötkö.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann took Mötkölä to the final tournament team with a scalpel line.
The solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far wise, even though everything wasn't according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team sank deep.
In Athens competitions Finns were known to have been present a little over 100.
It included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball trainers and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coachers in Bilbao too, but there are fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The appearance has grown to undiscovered proportions.
I'm sure no one can tell you exactly the exact number of Finnish contestants.
The estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10,000.
There was a number between here and there, and it's just an inexplicable number.
Here's to explain to the sports clubs.
In a global economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity to consider how we are going internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go to see how our girls and sons succeed in the world, says Professor Hannu Ikken of Sports Sociology.
Certainly, both in Spain and in volleyball's World Cups in Poland, there are Finns who apply for the experience.
Joint experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
There's got to be attractive to sports itself.
It's time for the sport to become part of a popular culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to Berlin to watch art.
But without successful masses, you can't move.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
Almost ten years passed.
Then the direction changed, and the country team's activities were raised to the ground.
The guys on the balloon made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Ikkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports, where the sacred trinity works: sports media sponsors.
In that case, the public will be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnalism is, Ikkonen reminds me.
Can balling species also move this massive interest to home series?
On average, basketball and volleyball play for hundreds or a little over a thousand viewers.
The question is a good one, and it is not necessarily an answer that would make it very good for the species.
The other school believes interest to move on.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for the trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the series in their home country are not of double interest.
There's a challenge for the social partners in the middle of the drug.
The Bottaksn property has almost 1,5 hectares off the lake.
Nastola pays the formal driver Valtteri Bottaksan beach cottitotont.
At its meeting on Monday, the Government approved the release of a property of 1.4 hectares.
In the future, there will be a free-time apartment.
In Nastola, Bottaks' success has been monitored since this mapping period.
He's being tried as a good ambassador to market Lahta, Lahti Region and Nastola.
Gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
The area has seven buildings in its state of state, of which six will be decommissioned by the end of this year at the expense.
Bottas won the formula 1 in Belgium this year.
He's at MM five.
Bottas is a native nastolic, and he lived with his childhood at Vil source.
Now he lives in England, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free from formulas.
Bottas has visited upper secondary schools and youth centres.
Design shocks are coming, but hardly for the poor.
It is presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by field ballers, but also by amateur Marcus Giron, one of the tops of the university players.
According to him, a shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The female shirt has been woven into silver sensors, where the data is transmitted to a mobile device in the shirt and still to a smartphone or flat-screen computer.
The sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress, and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the main unit is removed.
The fashion house has not given you the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor have you even mentioned its price, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company to invest in intelligent clothes.
Athos, California, has brought smart shirts and smart pets to sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
The clothes cost a hundred dollars apiece, and the central unit of the thumb they require costs two hundred dollars.

Smart way to save your textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, who started his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system where students in later years borrow their books from nominal compensation instead of selling the books straight forward.
\"My book of mathematics would normally have paid me $180; I paid for it throughout the academic year for 10 and a hour for the sandwich,\" says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covent College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his book last semester would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, an average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly determined to use online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay clearly less than students buying the book.
According to the company Neebo Inc, over 250 campus stores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the area reveal that about one quarter of the books of university bookstores were lease books during the past spring, says Trevor Meyer, Chairman of the Neebo Company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here, the simplest way to save money.
Online stores
In online stores, the new book can only be received one third of the price it would pay for a campus bookstore.
The recommendation for the ninth edition of the book Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is close to $290, but the specialities book from Chegg.com is priced at $239.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and the past appearance.
For example, the Calculus book is available at $93.49 on Chegg.com.
The last year student at Brigham Young University Matt Casaday, 25 years, tells us that he bought the book Strategic Media Decions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business – only $42 of Amazon.com online shop.
The new book would've paid 48 bucks.
The director of Amber's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if the previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reform of new weight is not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old weight can only be found in a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to purchase used books.
Rental
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to restore them and do not need them after your course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the book Calculus for the whole period costs about 20 dollars.
Please refer to the rules of the rental company, such as notes, use and wear of the highlight.
The renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-mails
The purchase of e-books instead of ordinary paper may also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented to pay the right to use e-books for bookstores such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg will receive an e-mail from Calculus for about $61 a month.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because many classics today can download for free, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
Comparing different sellers is worthwhile, which is the option chosen.
Joe Gault, 29 who will soon start Pepperdinen in jurisprudence, recommends using the book ISBN number in order to find a price, as it will enable you to make sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually got to get the book at full cost from the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legion Theatre is 20 years old
The theatre set up in 1994 is opposed to unemployment, exclusion and passiveism.
The activities are welcomed by everyone who wants to do art.
Organizes expressions of activity for the long-term unemployed of 17 to 35 years of age.
The presentations often take a position on society.
In recent years there have been, among other things, depression-related Depression Moderata, Minaminami! - humorist stories about narcissism and classical conventions.
He believes that every human being can change his or her own life.
Almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
In the fires this year almost double the number of people died compared to last year.
According to the media surveillance of the Finnish Rescue Central Organisation (Spek) so far 55 people have already died in the fires in 49 different fires.
Last year there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the organisation's fire-death statistics, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people were killed in fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in the apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in the temples, 21 in the homehouses, and seven in row houses and other small houses.
Spec reminds me of the repeating of home fire safety.
At least the performance of all home fire extinguishers should be ensured by Spec.
In addition, everyone should check that the means of early detection are easily accessible.
All the premises of the home must also have an accessible exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are at home alone.
NATO Summit: First protests at Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the Newport city centre in a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at Cardiff City Hall for the so-called countermeasure meeting.
Stephen Fairlough followed events this weekend and spoke with protestors who had arrived even since Belgium.
The young people were saved on a flight from the Australian Blue Mountains
After being stuck at night in the Blue Mountains in Australia’s New South Wales area, two teenagers were raised to safety.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went on a trip to Blackhead on Sunday.
The family were concerned about young people who hadn't returned home and called the police at 2:00 a.m.
A search party consisting of local police officers and helpers was sent to find young people, and two were found around 23 o’clock near the British Veilfalls.
She had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were raised to safety on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blue Mountains hospital with an ambulance, and they were stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have worked hard with the Russian tanks on the field.
According to the army's representative, the enemy's artillery fire has been so precise that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
During the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
The Ukrainian patrol ship that received artillery in south-east Ukraine last night sank in the morning, reports the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard didn't have any certainty about where the ship was shot.
The Separatists told me yesterday that they shot the ship in social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that the Ukrainian troops immediately withdraw to positions which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, during the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, an immediate ceasefire should be established without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also recalled that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from our partners' actions, Mr Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains got Malmo and Copenhagen flooded.
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the punishments struck South Sweden and Denmark.
The flood waters cut off a number of roads, mixed traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flooding may take, even though the rains were forecast to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains were surprising by the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was provided in advance of the rains.
According to Ari Mustala, the top-right meteorologist at the Finnish Air Science Institute, that it was very local that caused the region.
The rain zone looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should keep quiet and help France, says Francois Holland's main aids
Valls urged the deeply divided left to show his feelings: the socialist president in difficulty, who was not approved by the French majority by the composition of the new government.
The President deserves all due respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
\"Our mission is to remain alongside him,\" said Valls, and earned the applause.
In a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister called on the Government to leave the French state in peace despite the 35-hour working week of the new Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron, which had previously given this week, to the proposal that the rule should be reduced.
On Saturday, the Netherlands asked the Socialists to cooperate with the Government.
However, Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, gave rise to many arguments about the meeting of socialists who expressed differing opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing France to give up hope for the future.
Marine Le Pen, head of the National Front of the Estonian Republic, mocked the continued disputation of the socialists and said that Valls' new government would not last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war on a call, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to set up a new government after the previous one did not even last the summer.
\"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter,\" Le Pen told the reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to break down the Parliament and held the election of his party in early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing loss in the municipalities of March and held the extreme right in the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion of the Journal du Dimanche on Sundays, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break down into a number of competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher from Po-Uliopisto, warned that the French will soon lose their patience unless the new Socialist government is able to improve the economy and record unemployment.
\"There is a small chance for success, but the public must quickly note that the change is happening,\" he warned.
Otherwise, things can get worse.
Pokka betrayed the morning of Finland's plotters Kirsi Alm-Sira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda in the recording section of the program.
Last Thursday, the morning Finnish programme published a fun video of Thursday’s recordings on its Facebook page.
With the video, Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the morning of the next day's edition of Finland, but the recording does not go right into the pipe.
Alm-Sira is confused in his words when he tries to say a word about budget disputes, and his confusion will also result in Pouda and Rahkola losing their boys once and for all.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull a live broadcast again tomorrow, the morning of the Facebook update in Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68 worked at the magazine photo office, was placed in the third series of pottery in 1972.
The picture contains the Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
At Fredrikin Street in Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International Assembly was held in the House of Building Masters in May 1971.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had plenty of five minutes to describe.
I took this picture five meters away.
The light and the background were right.
I got it right this time.
From the look of Meir, you can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition succeeded in taking pictures of known persons or events.
It is great that you can also succeed in other images today, provided you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best part is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Statement: More than EUR 5 million has already been paid by the Aarnio Study
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 staff years.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed Jyväskylä's research on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajajuki suggests that the enforcement of police law enforcement and the fight against criminal acts could be improved significantly by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial treatment.
According to Rajamäe, modern technology allows the multi-use of crime-related material.
He points out that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fulfils the evidence chain and at the same time enables comprehensive law enforcement.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetable food forgot about the school wall: \"Food and chicken dishes included in casvisdie\"
The photo of the special news on the wall of the Pirkkala School of Women's Travel caused a meal in social media, says Yle on its website.
Plant fooders!
Fish and chicken dishes included in school lunch were grown.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a plant variety!
This is what is stated in a 15-year-old press release that forgot about the school wall.
I'll let you see the picture from here.
The image of the social media has led people to send angry feedback to Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Service, points out to Yle that the missing note is not true and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before I arrived, there have sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with healthcare in time.
Every student receives a meal according to their wishes, he points out to Yle.
Today at Pirkkala schools, students are offered a choice of vegetable food only with the permission of their parents and with the certificate of their doctor or nurse.
The risk justifies the solution to Ylle is that youth’s herbal trials may leave the diet less and the absence of meat or chicken may cause a surprise to the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near the 3 billion-dollar Prestige Cruise Agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to buy their competitors in Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
With this trade, Norwegian Cruises, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to Prestige Cruises and its rich customers as they continue to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to these sources, information on a possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private venture capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be public because negotiations would not take place in the public domain.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company operating in Miami has 13 cruise ships covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with turnover of USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which works so far from Miami, sails with the names O Oceanian and Regent brand names, including eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was 1.2 billion dollars, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The cruise industry worth USD 29 billion is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies are competing to become the first option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises is registered on the US stock market with its first issue in January 2014.
Apollo owns most of the company’s shares after the trade in 2007, worth USD 850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its combined Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay entertainment and casino company.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information provided, Genting's share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo's 20% and TPG Capital LP's share was 8 per cent from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises' cruise capacity in North America is 82%, as shown in the registration document published in connection with the launch of Prestige Cruise's shares.
The Tampere City Government is working on it today.
Animal hopes for strong support from the city government.
According to Salla Tuumivaara, CEO of Animalia, a doctorate at the University of Tampere, during the dolphins in Finland, and the world needs to be ended quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, the idea is that the presence of mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also like to be passed on to Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphin is not only an issue of animal law, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, the Judge points out.
According to the judgment, the death of the Säsi dolphin confirms the requirements of the definarium substation.
The death of the vision is a sad continuation of the dark history of the delfinary of Särkänniemi.
It is time to put a point on the dead, close the dolphin prison, and start to find out how Tampere dolphins could be transferred to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, the Judge requires.
You could not see the return to the initial environment of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi were able to experience more life than their unsupervised concrete, the Judge hopes.
The aim of the Animal Protection Union Animalia is to prohibit the use of all species of wild game in circuses in the complete reform of the existing animal protection law.
There's also dolphins in this group.
In support of the requirement, the Executive Director of Animalia, Judge of the Court of Justice, will take part today in the demonstration of dolphins on behalf of 1.9.
The demonstration by the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will be carried out against the start of the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2300 dolphins are being imprisoned or brutally killed annually, either for dolphin use or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with East Ukraine on a new country
On Sunday, the Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the Separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the difference between the region and the country, the Russian news sources say.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the eastern region of Ukraine under Separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be rethinked in order to give the people of the Russian-speaking region power to defend their own rights and interests.
The request made by Putin to the Kiev Government to negotiate with the Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy, which he has been following since the beginning of five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared Novorossian independence that it can turn to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to regain the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk area controlled by separatists, which was captured by separatists in March and April, following the accession of Moscow to the Crimean Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and Separatists have recently poured the region into Novorossier, the new Russia... this term reminds us of the glorious days prior to the revolutions of the Great Republic of Russia.
According to Russian News Office Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are \"a must-all\" as long as Ukrainian politicians are campaigning for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces attacking civilians in Separatist areas.
\"We need to start a wide-ranging negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and on the status of the state in South-East Ukraine, which takes into account the interests of people living there,\" he says.
According to Mr Peskovi, Putin's reference to nationality is linked to wider independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in trying to dispel the fears of the Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant Eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
There is no debate on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is an internal conflict between Ukraine'.
The interim observation of the Kremlin representative aimed at correcting Putin's comments - stressed that the Russian regime is dealing with the rebellion of separatist separatists in the Eastern regions in a different way than the Crimean, when in practice it took over the region whose majority of the population of 2 million people are ethnicly Russians.
Moscow would be much more difficult to join even the areas of Donetsk or Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because the pre-conflict polls in Ukraine supported the majority of the population.
Independence, which the Russian diplomats have discussed at international forums, would give the Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give Kreml practically power in the territory that unites Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was included in Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian headquarters and commercial shipping ports and historic coastal areas.
The region between Russia Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal alloyes that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, the Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making powers of regions other than the core area of Ukraine on their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to be very different from the view of the Kremli and Moscow, perhaps armed and parasitic separatists.
Putini presented its most recent demands to the Government of Kiev to negotiate negotiations with the Russian rebels as equal partners after the last week the rebels moved further to Russia's tanks and troops entering the eastern Ukraine from the peaceful region of Azov's coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novozavsk, supported by Russia, will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area until Crimea.
It has led to the consolidation of the city of Mariupoli by massive civilians and military staff. Mariupol, a half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovski and a narrow country leading to Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels, asking for additional measures to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
We'll soon catch a point where there's no return, Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed additional sanctions in order to be put in place if the crisis in Ukraine is re-examined under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw their positions in the region of Ilovakis, after the transfer of two Russian armory departments and 1,000 soldiers to the Donetsk area last week in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, reported to journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenkko, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers in the Ilovakis region of Russia were switched to 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in the Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening painting was made by a Japanese player named Pussuke Honda on the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntar first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez was punished.
Laziok received a coup after the end of the game, but the goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan this year from Real Madrid.
Milan’s former attacker in Inzagh’s training debyyt was only half the stadium of San Siro.
39 000 audiences were declared to be the audience.
Australian posters and Gabi Grecko in the round of the nuanced scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may have been stolen by hackers and his fiancée and the naked images of the Hollywood A-star Gabi Grecko.
In the entertainment world, there have been convulsions since a series of substations of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging scandal.
Hacker has been told to hold a total of 60 naked photos of the Nebula star Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingnes, singer of Rihanta, Aria Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also, the images of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko, located in Melbourne, are apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 famous names on the list.
And what Grecko said last month was to the Confidential magazine, which is disgusting.
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
In New York, Grecko, with his comments, reported a case in a web page as a shame and said that the victims feel embarrassed.
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of the samples from Palmer on the upper-end pool edge.
Palmer's film presentations include the film Love and Honor-responsor Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of Chuck's series, Strahovski and Sugar Push, Browning, did not comment on hacked images yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said to the TMZ magazine that there is a shaky violation of privacy.
The actor Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker in his tweet: \"The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product.
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost as if it were in its home field and rose from Cuba to the sensational victory in the volleyball World Championships.
Look at the photos of the fan whisper.
The Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white, but Finnish blue and white.
