Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves in the Muppet Show.
Some members of the National Assembly have been taken on board on the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, representative of the Wales Parliament).
The alarm came after the performance of the National Assembly (Assembly) to be called the Welsh Parliament.
Now, representatives of different political backgrounds are all afraid that they may be made subject to the new title.
According to one of the Labour Party Members, the group is concerned that their new name will be fine with the words \"Twp\" and \"Pwp\".
It's not for our readers in Wales, it's for the two of us, and pwp is for the cock.
According to a member of the Plaid Party, the whole group is “satisfied, ” and therefore alternatives are proposed.
One Conservative Member said that his group was ‘open to change’, however, he noted that only one jump from MWP was ‘Muppet’.
It is worth noting here that, in Welsh, the letters ‘w’ fall like the words ‘u’ in the yorkshire English, i.e. ‘map’ in the MWP.
The position of the National Assembly responsible for drawing up the draft law for the change of name is as follows: \"The final decision, of course, is in the hands of the Members of the National Assembly as regards the titles of the members of the National Assembly.
The Swedish Government Act 2017 allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed to include the name of the Wales Parliament and which received broad support.
With regard to the address of the representatives, the Commission prefers the Welsh Parliament Member (representative of the Wales Parliament) and its shortening WMP, but the public consultation supported the alternative of MWP.
There are new alternatives for Members, however, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to present the bill on nominal changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of Members and the Commission's structures.
The Members will be able to take their final steps in discussing the draft legislation on their own address.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on changing the country's name
The citizens vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the \"Nak-Macedon Republic\"
The aim of the referendum is to give a point with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia, at the end of a decade's debate.
It has long been said by Athens that, with the name of its northern neighbour, it is essentially a territorial need and has repeatedly objected to its request for EU and NATO sampling.
President Gjorge Ivanov Macedon himself opposes the referendum on roll-over and thus does not take part in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a compromise that must be made for EU and NATO accession.
In a difficult situation, the Harangs of St. Martin have been silenced.
“Better as I hear from older people, every corner was a bar and a church, ” says Adams.
- Not one of these days -
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“The people have been socializing differently these days, ” he says.
– Bars are no longer the social day where people go every day,
With regard to churches, Adams is afraid that the sale of church wealth will not replace leaders’ hopes, “and in time they will again be held in the same place from which they started, ”
And the location of the churches, it adds, will include residential buildings whose community also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those buying housing in these buildings will be white - claim - and this will continue to speed up the final closure of churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those moving to these apartments would join the community.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem grew up as a city of black – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the temple in the thirty years,
then held by a nearby black congregation.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend of Harlemic Shopping Street 125. Street is known about the use of blacks or the management of a boycott against its unsolicited business owners who refused to sell black products.
In 1939 a fireman caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation it was built to order a community run by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin, proudly called the bells of the poor.
In July, an expert who spoke of gambling said that this gambling is a cultural heritage, a musical instrument of irreplaceable historical significance.
The expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the world's first gambling game by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who stood up 18 years ago to play the biggest bell.
Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't sign up for anyone.
Over the past few months in St. Martin, a difficult situation has been brought about by the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who were partly engaged in the secular management of the temple, partly by the Bishop's Office.
In July, the Board of Governors of the parochia, in writing, turned to the Bishop’s Office, protesting that the Office would ‘responsibly pass on the costs to the Council, although the Council did not participate in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs created by the Office.
Some members of the religious community complain about the lack of transparency around the Office's house.
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California when he died of cancer.
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while fishing for cancer on the opening day of the shrimp season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place at the Beacon's Beach Coast before 7 a.m. at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel at the KSWB TV in San Diego told me that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he became careful that a boy was crying out for help.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, “He bit me!
He bit me.
“It was torn apart by its keybone, ” said Hammel, “what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I started screaming to get everyone out of the water, ” he added. “ There is a shark in the water.”
The boy was transported to the Rady Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The boy - attacking shark's tree is unknown.
As Officer Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, sharks in the area had been detected, but then it was established that it was not a species that was dangerous to man.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy had traumatic injuries on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Sami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would be expanding in the British beauty market.
The Sainsbury's expert would pick up the race with vendors and large-style peppers with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
The decline in sales of fashion and household articles has also continued to grow as part of the growing volume of the British beauty market of GBP 2.8 billion in 11 stores across the chain, and in the event of success they will also be in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the pipe line is due to the fact that stores are trying to fill up the polc surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's told us that it doubles its offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are now offered for the first time.
But the previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be placed in a larger area on brand stands like Boots and similar stores.
The chain also reboots the Boutique make-up family, where most of the products are now renal – these are being sought by more and more young customers today.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop is also testing its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which was opened last week in Croydon, southern London, while the other will be in Birmingham Shell Oak.
By spreading online purchases and transferring food shopping habits to small local trades, large stores need to make greater efforts to attract customers.
According to CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the supply will increasingly compare to mixed trading, as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more and more services and non-food products.
Since he bought the two chains two years ago, in several hundred stores of Sainsbury's, the Argos' classes and some of the Habitats' classes have also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisitions are even more profitable.
The chain in the store was a failure in its earlier attempt to pull up beauty and pharmaceutical classes.
Sainsbury's started a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but this was ended by the debate on the distribution of the proceeds of the pharmaceutical classes in their stores.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold 125 million pounds three years ago the pharmaceutical company operating in 281 to Celesio operating the Lloyds chain.
According to the chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy, and in four shops he will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As stated by Sainsbury's commercial director, Paul Mills-Hicks said: “By transforming the looks of our peppers, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
We also hired skilled staff to help interested parties with advice.
Our brand offers all the needs, the attractive environment and the comfortable location provide a tempting power that increases the buying experience to a new level.
Peter Jones, after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound agreement
Dragons’ Star, Peter Jones’s, was released after Holly Willoughby’s television programme manager withdrew from the 11 million important agreements on the marketing of lifestyle products in order to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's brand of home clothing and accessories.
The company of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand recorded by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old programmer announced on Instagram that he was getting out.
Holly Willoughby carefully pulled the match at the Dragons' Star, Peter Jones, when he came out of their promising, lifestyle-based business at the last minute, to focus on his own extremely profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to certain sources, when Jones’s TV salvation on Tuesday, Jones’s Business Empire Marlow (Buckinghamshire) headquarters, announced during an intense discussion that, due to its new contracts of a total value of £1.5 million, there was no time left for their joint brand of home wear and accessories to be dedicated to Truly.
The company of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand recorded by Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's worth of 11 million pounds.
While the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from the island to one of his vacations.
According to one source: “The Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
It was supposed to deal with this in the long term, and it will give you a living in the next few decades.
Getting out was a total surprise for everyone.
I was surprised by everyone that happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to starting.
In Marlow's office, the warehouse is full of the goods that await the sale.
According to experts, the departure of one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, the host of this Morning, may cost the company millions of dollars from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothing and possible slides.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-children hostess and husband, Dan Baldwin, had been having close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby Capp set up the Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are used to vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the product face of M&S and take over Ant McPartlin as the director of his show ITV I'm Celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night commented on what happened: “We do not want to comment on [Jones]’s business affairs, ” he said.
Hard words came out, “then we fell in love, ”
He was joking about the criticisms that the press would receive from him about his statement, which some might consider to be “unsatisfied, ” and that he expressed such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
\"Why did Trump let you do that?
– asked Trump about a funny \"hears\" sound.
- I wouldn't let anything--
As he noted, Kim would also be pleased to meet for the second time, following the first meeting in Singapore, Trump welcomed North Korea's nuclear weapons as a huge step.
However, the consultations on nuclear weapons have been stricken.
Over three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Jongho, North Korea, on Saturday, informed the United Nations General Assembly that, as his country sees, the United States is not being born, an appropriate response is due to the early steps of North Korea.
Instead, according to his statement, the United States will continue to maintain sanctions for the exercise of pressure.
Trump was more optimistic about this in a campaign speech.
“ Things are going great with North Korea, ” he said.
- We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have been lost there.
But now it's a very good relationship between us.
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim were a positive result – the completion of missiles, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke this unusually about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s not hard to act first, but there’s no crowd out there of 10,000 people trying to get in in long, only about 200 people standing before me, ” Trump said, pointing out to the group before him.
There are hundreds of dead people in Indonesia with tsunamis and earthquakes on the island.
Indonesia, even after the Lomboki earthquake, refused the help of international aid organisations.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombs had to be installed, no disaster at national level has been reported, which would be a prerequisite for the arrival of international assistance.
“In many cases, it was very clear that they did not need international assistance, so our situation is a little difficult, ” said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on the compilation of a Pailus-based aid team, but it is not yet certain that foreign people will be able to participate in site rescues.
According to Sutopo, the National Disaster Agency spokesperson, Indonesian agencies are currently carrying out an assessment of the request situation to see whether there is a need to involve international aid organisations.
Despite the continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country faces the destructive power of nature with a very unprepared eye.
Although the Aceh province was built in tsunami sites, it is not common in other coastal areas at all.
Similarly, there was a tsunami signal in place, the apparent lack of the tsunami siren system in Palu also contributed to the development of a disaster requiring human life.
Even in the best time, transport can be difficult between the Indonesian islands.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationing in Lombs is on its way to Palu, but at least three more days before it reaches the affected zone.
President Joko Widodo has put the knock-out infrastructure of Indonesia at the heart of his election campaign and did not save the cost in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko Government is now facing budgetary deficits before next year's elections.
In addition, the president must face the ongoing tensions of the parties in Indonesia, since members of the Muslim majority have started to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people had to die and tens of thousands had to be settled because of the riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs had to meet with boxers, bows and arrows on the streets, as well as other warts.

The police are asking the residents who saw or died to report.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still early, but I would like everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street who may have seen or heard something to contact us.
In addition, I would ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to look for anything that might be on-board with a camera, also because they may have information relevant to the investigation.
The spokesperson of the police confirmed that the murdered woman was a sheepenhead resident and found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.

The Parliament's Cromwell statue is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever.
The exile of the statue could be poetic justice because Cromwell and his fanatic puritans destroyed the cultural and religious heritage of England with Taliban enthusiasm.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick’s proposal is “defeated, an attempt to redefine history ”
According to the president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith said: “It was inevitable that, at some point in the current debates on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell, before the Westminster Palace, would eventually become a target.
During the civil war in England, Cromwell did not order and execute the repression.
So maybe another Cromwell may have been victimized by his first century uprising, Thomas's actions.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft reflects the opinion of the 19th century of the impressive Cromwell, and a historical form of commemoration that should be celebrated even today,
In this regard, Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was perhaps less than at the end of the 19th century, but many of them still consider Parliament to be the defender of external pressure, which, of course, was a monoarchia for him.
Whether this picture is really accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
However, it is certain that this conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the further destiny of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one of the sides of this conflict.
And it is worth celebrating the achievements of Lord Proctor, and we should remember them,
A Chinese owner of a killer pig wounded to death
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and injured a farmer on a market in southwest China.
His last name was found only as Yuan, covered with blood, with a torn hive in addition to the pig on the market of the town of Liupanshui, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.

Like little children, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt me.
All you have to do is give them respect,\" he said.

More than 20 million were watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
In total, over 20 million viewers on 6 television channels followed, interestedly, the testimonys of Brett Kavanaugh applying for the supreme court position and of Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of rape in the eightties.
Meanwhile, the political sin situation was not solved, and the broadcasters had to cancel the regular programme due to the last Friday screw in place: Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Criminal Affairs that he was 100% certain that, at a high school party, Kavanaugh took him and tried to undress him.
In Kavanaugh's passionate testimony, he told me that to 100 percent certain that it didn't happen.
The testimony from Nielsen reported over 20.4 million people probably saw it on Friday.
Nielsen calculated with the average number of views of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The other channels providing the hearing, such as PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is hard to measure the number of those who watch shows at their workplace.
For the purpose of the comparison, there are many viewers who are used to being a football jury or an Oscar player.
According to Nielsen, among all the channels, Fox News Channel, who promoted experts to support the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the highest, on average, 5,69 million viewers during the full-day hearing.
Second place, ABC is with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS 3,1, NBC 2,944, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN 2,52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
The interest did not decrease after the hearing.
The main character of the drama on Friday was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued the statement saying that the senator took the Voksa by Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS were seen on Friday morning as the loud crowd of protestors bet the elevator to the court committee meeting.
The crowd was still squeezing for a minute, and CNN was passing the scene on live broadcasts.
“I am standing here before you,” said a woman to the senator.
– You really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the public of the country,
Others shouted: “You have the authority to do what not so many women do.
Mr Flake just said that his office issued a statement and then, before the elevator's door was closed, he added that he would share what he had to say in a Commission hearing.
On cable and broadcasting channels, the committee was alive by hours after voting on Kavanaugh’s nomination for the full Senate.
However, Flake said that he was willing to do so only if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority Democrats advocated.
Flake was convinced by his talks with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
Flake decided on the basis of discussions with Coons and other senators later.
Flake's decision was correct, as it was clear that without the investigation, Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump's running an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.

The police struck with catalyst separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the independent party protestors attacked the police and thousands joined the rival protests on the first anniversary of the clashing referendum on the part of Catalan.
The group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powders at them, so they were now covered with dense dust.
During the later part of the day, further fightings occurred during which the police tried to maintain the order with rubber.
“ We don’t forget, we didn’t forgive you, ” slogling independence groups and “live behind Spain ” were facing each other for hours.
According to local press reports, fourteen people were exposed to minor injuries in protests.
The tension continues to decrease in the region that has been transferred to independence, after a referendum on 1 October celebrated by the Catalan separatists considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters voted for a large majority in favour of the break-up, although the participation rate was rather low, as a large part of the Union's Unions have stifled the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop voting in the polls with aggressive conflicts.
Independence groups were on the street all night long to prevent demonstrations that supported the national police.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the demonstration didn't end up on the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician involved in separatist demonstrations, says that there is no chance that Catalania will gain independence.
“Tavaly was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents say tears of joy that we can vote for, but by now our case has been stricken, ” he said.
Although last December's regional elections have made it difficult for Catalan independence parties to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most well-known leaders have made voluntary exiles, or are waiting for a court to rule on their role in organising referendums and proclamation of independence.
According to a 42-year-old car driver, Joan Puig, who's on his phone to support the police, the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense, ” she says.
One of the Catalan leaders in the early arrest of the negotiations, Oriol Junqueras, announced on Saturday last year that he was going to be in the European Parliament elections next year.
“I can mainly reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression represented by the Spanish Government if I participate as candidates in the European elections, ” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men driving their cars into a house

Menga hit Livingston's Rangers' team by 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the victory of Livingston
In the first class, Livingston was surprised by the second defeat of the Rangers team, who has been active in 18 games as a coach of the ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal reported the real difference since Gary Holt's team went to a dead race with the Hibernian team in second place.
The Gerrards, therefore, remained undefeated in the current season of the Scottish league, and will be faced with the first-place Hearts team next Sunday, with eight remaining points.
Before that, however, Rangers are waiting for a match on Thursday in the European League against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his division competition series to six wins, which means that Kenny Miller has not yet been released with the team by the triggering Holt last month.
Livingston has missed a number of situations against the untraceable guest team
Holt's team could've taken the lead long before the only goal of the game, because their attack game didn't cause the Rangers a few problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the same opponent's defense, but he pulled too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped to reach Craig Halkett's ball in front of the goalline.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game because they were sure that they could disrupt the guests in fixed play situations.
This is exactly the kind of situation that was created by the decisive goal.
The Rangers had a kick-off, and the Livingston found a breach of defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who found this in the middle of the sixteenth.
At this stage of the game, Rangers led the same ball-fighting, but domestic protection continued to be impenetrable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for a single situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman was tried by the Rangers' cap, Allan McGregor's leg, and Lithgow's got another free kick in the Livingston.
There have been continuous cross-border balls in the 16s of Livingston, but the defenders have turned their backs on each other. Two of them have not been received by the attack team: one of the Entrants, Glenn Middleton, who joined as a replacement player, and the other for a warrant.
\"Fenomenal – game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaroni from Arena means Alaskar Lamont, journalist of the BBC Scotland
Livingston provided phenomenal performance and hit the beans.
Players were one to one and a half excellently featured, and over a period of past past expectations.
The members of the team and their style of play have barely changed since they returned to the finish line, but Holt's efforts deserve a lot of recognition, since the coach came in, he's been cheering up the team.
Several players have brought the best form.
Captain Halkett worked with a hugely organized defense, and Menga was quite agitated by Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt.
The Rangers played without an idea.
As well as they were sometimes under Gerrard's leadership, they were now unable to get that level.
The last shot was always missing – by the way, only once, they managed to break domestic protection – so the Rangers must get together quickly, because they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdo doingzan found for a joint reception in Cologne
It was a pleasant atmosphere and a good example of the morning meeting of Turkish and German leaders on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin.
This was the last day of his visit to Germany, which was shared by Erdořan, to improve the relationship between NATO Member States.
The relationship has deteriorated between the two countries due to human rights, freedom of the press and EU membership of Turkey.
He then traveled to Cologne for a new, built-in, huge trade-off ceremony.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
As for security reasons, the police banned the assembly of the 25 000 people before the wedding, but many of the President's supporters appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdořan protestors, including several Kurds, expressed their disdain with Erdořan's policy and the fact that the German government decided to accept the Head of State.
The two opposite protests are a fine example of what the President-in-Office's policy shares, which some Turkish-born German citizens celebrate as a hero, while others see the Autocrat.

Six prison guards were injured in a heavily guarded man's prison during the riots, reported to the prison board.
The riots started at 09:30 a.m. on Sunday morning at the Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire and failed to contain them for now.

And in October last year, a special process was also needed to overcome a serious disturbance, in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
Rosa's hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the state of the affected areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely achieved by tropical depression, but it is expected that this will have to be the case for the state at the beginning of next week, when the remainder of the hurricane crossed Rosa’s name is sweeping through the deserted southwest region, with a dramatic increase in the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already commissioned flood preparations from West Arizona to the southern and eastern parts of Nevada and south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is predicted that Rosa will travel straight through Phoenix's city on Tuesday, where it is expected that it will arrive on Monday night and bring with it great rain.
The Phoenix meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “From 1950, ten tropical cycles have reached a tropical storm or depression within the 200-mile zone of Phonix!
For example, the hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached the border of AZ 40 miles [40 km].
The latest models of the National Hurishan Centre predict a fine of between 50 and 100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as in the territory of Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
The other parts of the southwest desertous areas (midland areas of thesky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) can be counted as rainfalls between 25 and 50 mm, but may fall to 100 mm in some places.
The rain caused by Rosa may bring relief for areas not under threat of lightning water, as the area is currently under severe drought.
Despite the fact that orphans pose a serious threat, some of the rainfalls can have a beneficial effect on the southwest landscape that is struggling with the aerial.
“In American drought monitoring services, more than 40% of the territory of Arizona is hit by a minimum of extreme drought, which is considered the second most dangerous category – it is reported by Weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa will first arrive on the island of Also-California in Mexico.
He continues to be hurricane-like, and in the morning of Sunday, up to a cut of 137 km/h, about 600 km south of the Mexican Punta Eugenia, and he'll be heading north at approximately 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder currents in the Pacific and will lose its power.
Thus, Mexico’s coasts are expected to be a tropical storm again Monday afternoon or evening clocks.
In some areas of Mexico, there can be dense rain, which will significantly increase the chance of creating orphans.
‘The rainfalls can, on average, result in a rainfall of between 70 and 50 mm from Also-Clifornia to the north-west part of Sonora, where at some point 250 mm the rainfall could be found in the Weather.com report.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm northwards through Mexico before Tuesday, during the early dawn hours, she would reach Arizona, as a tropical depression, so that she can reach the southern territories of Utah by midnight.
“The greatest threat posed by Rosa and its remains will be that of the Also-Clifornia, Northwest-Sonora and that of the Southwest desert regions of the United States will be an extraordinary rainfall, ” said the National Hurrikan Centre.
The rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning discharges in deserted areas, and the mountain areas should be kept from landfalls.

Hundreds of people died in an earthquake in Indonesia, the number of deaths rising.
Many have been driven by the price, and at least 384 people have lost their lives when the huge waves have reached the shore. The disaster is caused by a powerful earthquake and a fugitive on the island of Sulaweis, Indonesia, declared on Saturday by local authorities.

The fountain was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When there was a departure call yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, they did not escape, so the waves became a victim, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency (BNPB) at the Jakarta Press Conference.
“The fugitive came not only in himself, but also in the open sea cars, wooden logs, houses and everything else from the coast, ” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h before it reached the coast.
There were those who climbed up the top of the trees from the price and escaped, he said.
About 16 700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
The air footage published by the Agency shows a number of destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and broken bridges, as well as a mass surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further retro-reflects hit the coastal city.
The earthquakes were detected in an area of about 2.4 million people.
According to the statement of Indonesia's Technology Evaluation and Application Agency (BPPT), approximately 200 times more energy was released during the Friday earthquake than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hirosim during World War II.
The Agency added that the city was located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical characteristics could be strengthened by the effects of the fountain.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused was “important, ” thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Several victims' bodies were found among the ruins of broken buildings, said, and then added that the number of injured was 540, and they were looking for another 29 people.
Nugroho's declaration that the number of injured persons and the damage caused may be even higher in the coastal area (190 miles) from Palu, the area called Donggala, because it was closer to the earthquake epicentre.
Communication “is completely paralyzed, it is impossible to get information from Donggala, ” said Nugroho.
“ There are more than 300,000 living there, ” says the Red Cross, in which it has been announced that the professionals and volunteers of the organization are already on their way to the affected area.
“The situation is already tragic, but it may be even worse, ” they added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday about the fact that he did not inform the population about the Paut tsunami, but according to the management, the waves were already reaching the coast when the alarm was released.

Within a few minutes, there will be a huge wall of water on the shore, running cars and buildings with you.
The Reuters news agency couldn't confirm the authenticity of the recording for now.

The city’s airport was only opened to facilitate aid work, closed for all other purposes until October.
President Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres set up on Sunday.

“They said that they saw a lot of ruined houses, ” he added.
- It's very bad.
While the aid teams were involved in preparing disaster response work, some complained that foreign experts with great experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, aid shipments and personnel from overseas can only be released into the territory of the country if the accident scene is declared a disaster at national level.
That never happened.
“The case will continue to be treated as a country-wide disaster, ” said Aulia Arrani, a spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– As the government acknowledges that it is a national disaster, we can let in international aid services, but no announcement has been made so far,
During the second night after the earthquake and escape, Please, friends and family members of the missing persons were still hoping that they would be among those whose miraculous escapes would smuggle some light into the dark atmosphere of reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.

So I'm you and I'm the one and all of us are the same.
Kanye means the only one, and this is only Ye, which represents the good that lives in us, the bad, the confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we really are.
Ye is one of the famous rappers who make their names change with pleasure.
Sean Combs has, for example, been running under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he has chosen the names of Love and Brother Love from now on.

The US should double the funding framework for MI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double support for research in this direction, Kai-Fu Lee, an investor of solutions using artificial intelligence, and a user who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said that after the US Government made announcements about artificial intelligence, even though the US did not have an official MI strategy.
In the meantime, China has announced its related plans: the country's goal is to become the world's number one MI developer by 2030.
“A double of the cost framework for MI studies would be a good start, as all other countries would be significantly left behind compared to the US and the next breakthrough in MI would be reduced, ” Lee said.
By duplicating research aid, it could also increase the chances of the United States taking the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence, in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silkon Valley and the New World Order, ” published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of China's most important companies dealing with MI+.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an MI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player and later became a member of the Microsoft Research Board and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology competitions previously announced by the US Government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and was interested in when they would arrange the next such event, because at this time there was an opportunity to explore the new formators.
UK researchers often have to work hard to obtain the necessary state support for their research, said Lee.
“ China is not acidifying scientific leaders, but the big companies, ” he added.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been signing several large university skulls over the last few years to work in the field of MI.
According to Lee, changing immigration policy could also help the United States' efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think you should automatically receive a green card to those who have a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence, ” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China's national natural science fund provides similar support to staff of academic institutions, as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China was lower, explained Lee.
This year, the Ministry of Defence established the Joint Artifical Intelligence Center MI Centre, where various industrial professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee crossed by the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative,
The NSF currently spends $100 million dollars a year in support of MI research.
Meanwhile, the United States of America, which planned to set up a National Security MI committee, has not taken further action for months.
There is a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name
The population of Macedonia was at the Sunday referendum to change the name of the country to the Republic of the Sea-Macedón. This step would be to resolve a gap with Greece for several decades, which prevented the acceptance of the country's application for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, one of whose province is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour is a sign of a claim for a similar Greek territory, so far, he has regarded NATO and EU membership of the country.
In June, the two governments negotiated a deal with the new name of the state, but according to the national emotions, the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not be taking part in the referendum and that as a result of the started boycott campaign, he had doubts whether the 50% participation rate required for a valid referendum could be achieved.
The question raised by the voters is as follows: \"Do you support NATO and EU membership of the country and accept the agreement with Greece?\"
The supporters of the roll-over, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price in order to be one of the countries raised in Macedonia, the ruins of Yugoslavia, to have a chance for EU and NATO membership.
“I came to vote today for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia could live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us, ” said Olivera Georgiyevska (79) in Spain.
Although the referendum in itself is not legally binding, sufficient Members have stated that they feel compulsory about the result of the vote.
This change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the State Election Committee, no report of irregularities came until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached just 16% up to now. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ultimately accounted for 66% of the registered voters).
“For the sake of my children, I came to vote because we have a place in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in Spain, in the capital.
Ziran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and son Dushko, have taken part in the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
Before the Parliament building in Spain, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for the referendums.
\"We also support NATO and EU membership of the country, but we want to join it with a proud, raised head, and not through the maid door,\" Kavadarkov said.
– We are a poor country, but we did not lose our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can also turn to China or Russia as part of the Estonian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be accounted for with investments in Macedonia that a country with more than 20% unemployment needs.
\"I think that the majority will support our case, as more than 80% of the country's population essentially supports the EU and NATO membership,\" Zaev said after he gave his vote.
He also added that the 'yes' vote means 'insurrection of the country's future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by a Political Research Institute of Macedonia, 30-43% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
On the basis of another survey by Telma TV on Macedón, a 57% share rate is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to go to the vote, 70% said yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate should be at least one vote more than 50%.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western Party government, which came into power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, who works for the entire Brighton protection, acquires a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have been very vulnerable to Brighton, so Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero got his goal shot in 65 minutes like that was the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentinian battler, as the first step of the attack, received a pass on the middle track, and
Hanging between the three Brighton protectors, he got out into the open field.
Then four green bees surrounded Aguero.
He lured out a protector and then ran down to the 16th of Brighton.
And then he hit the left for Sterling, who showed up there.
The English warrior has already returned the ball to Aguero with force within the sixteenth, who has finished the action with his right foot, finding the brightener, Mathew Ryan's gate right side.
“Aguero has problems with his feet – said Pep Guardiola, Manchester City Manager to reporters.
– We agreed that you could play 55, up to 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
Fortunately, that's when he got to go.
With Sterling's action at the beginning, he managed to get the Blues to the British Championship.
The goal was born in 29 minutes, when
Aguero, who is on the surface of the Brazilians, has been given a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossball towards Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane played with the ball for a while before moving Sterling to the lengths.
The blues were just able to slip the ball into the gate before he slipped outside the base line.
The City is next Tuesday, 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany, playing with the Hoffenheim team in the League of Champions.
Scherzer wants to make Rockies difficult.
Since the Nationals team missed the opportunity to enter the aftershave, there was no reason for them to make a real effort.
However, Scherzer, who is always in competition, can hardly wait to meet the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play. Rockies is a game-playing advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball League.
The Rockies secured themselves at least one vulnerable place on Friday night with the victory against the Nationals, but the first title of their division was still waiting for you.
“ independently of the fact that we no longer have a chance, we can stand up against them by the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver over the year is expected to be on the roof.
Of course, I'm in the mood to get on the track like this.
The Nationals team still has to choose the beginner for Sunday, but the news shows that Scherzer will be the drummer in this situation.
Scherzer, who participated in drumming on Thursday, will have his 34th opening on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-hand Washington player has 18-7 this season, 2.53 ERA and 300 strings after 220 and 2/3.
Trump campaign in Western Virginia
The president also referred to the situation of the Supreme Judge, Mr Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
\"In November, everything we've done is at stake.
We're just five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It is one of the greats, the big ones, and I am not going in person, but I am actually starting, so I go everywhere to support the best candidates, ” he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone sees what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they are able to use any means to regain power, to see evil and inferiority.
No matter who is harmed, who are put to their hands to be in control, their power. That is what they want, control, and power, but we do not abandon ourselves.
According to the president, the Democrats are putting in “objectives and obstacles. ”
“ They could see all this in the last four days, ” he said, “democrats are angry and malicious and lying and lying.
According to his name, he referred to Senator Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, in which he heard the loud disputing of the gathered mass.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, no, wait, all this with a very bad speech, that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He's not going to tolerate anyone who's free to say what they think.
I wasn't surprised at all when the Momentum activists in my party decided on my censorship.
After all, I'm just the last one in a long line of working party Members who were told they weren't welcome, just because we said what we thought.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan received similar treatment for resisting anti-Semiticism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like the fact that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which in an ironic way are the issues where Jeremy also disagreed with former leaders.
The invitation to the working party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday said that they wanted a “spiritual and productive meeting. ”
For most of these Friday evening meetings, which was held as a local representative of the Labour Party, were exactly the same.
However, today’s voices have changed, and the more polite, more polite, policy promises have been forgotten if ever they were ever implemented.
It is increasingly noticeable that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, they have been waiting so many times for me to turn my back on my individual opinion and take a position with which I would never agree otherwise, whether it is national security matters or the single European market.
After all my public talk, no matter what I actually said, they start playing games on social media, they demand my redemption, they criticise the policy that goes into the middle, and they tell me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many colleagues because the comments I receive tend to be limited to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to stand out on a daily basis by sexist and racist attacks.
The most disappointing aspect of our day's policy is that such attacks have become a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the need for the Labour Party to support the culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we have abandoned diversity, and with all the \"confidence\" motives and all the changes to electoral rules, the party is becoming more and more limited.
Over the last few years, many have advised me not to be so literal, and then “all will be fine ”
However, that is not why I entered the political course.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student because it upsets me that the Thatcher government has so neglected schools that our classroom was almost omnished, and then I fought for better public care for the most deprived local councillor and government minister.
I never hid my political views in the toilet, and I didn't do anything else during the last election.
Nottingham in East was completely clear to everyone about the political positions I represent and on which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only the families, but also the companies and public services, I do not understand why so much time and energy should be devoted to questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum but to my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that any threat by redemption or political means will not discourage me from acting in my own opinion and taking into account the interests of everyone.
Mr Chris Leslie, Representative of Nottingham East
Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr breaks to the top unblemished
Two late attempts have changed somewhat in the same outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr has the most entertaining game of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only one of the ten teams is undefeated.
Thanks to their unbiased defense and prudence, they won, so the domestics and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to face a huge challenge in our games, but we are still undefeated, so I have every reason for happiness, ” he said.
Robyn Christie, Melrose’s player, said: “We need to know that Ayr has made much better use of his situation than we have.
Grant Anderson did his 14th-minute attempt to make Frazier Climo point, and Ayr got the advantage. Thanks to the yellow paper from the warlors to Captain Rory Hughes, Melrose could have flown the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt was not a point.
Climo's got the Ayr defense with a criminal, right at half-time, then a one-person experiment, so the first half-time ended up with Ayr's result of 17-5.
Melrose was a strong start on the second half, and he was selling Bagg for Patrick Anderson's attempt, reducing the team's disadvantage to five points.
The game was then for a long time, since Ruaridh Knott suffered serious injury and had to be taken off the track, and in the continuation Ayr continued to increase the advantage by trying to take advantage of Stafford McDowall, whose beads with the help of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, also got a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to stop Bruce Colvine from trying to break the pressure on them.
The home team started to lock up again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for installing Climo without a ball, MacPherson introduced a touchdown from the crime line behind Ayr's team.
Climo sold what he repeated almost after his reboot, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry off to try his fifth home.
The star of Still Game has started a new career in the catering industry
It seems that one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry: it has been discovered that a restaurant was put at the head of a company that manages restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the popular series of BBC that he writes together and in which he works with his old comedian, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next nine will be your closing season, and it seems Kiernan is already planning on his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from the Glassgow hospitality industry.
\"The sea is ours: Bolivia, who does not have the beach, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrolling the sailboated Navy commando in La Paz.
The centers are ocean blue flags.
Marine bases advertise the following myth from Lake Titicaca to Amazon: “We have a good time at sea.
It's our duty to get back...
In Bolivia, without the beach, the memories of the lost beach still live alive, which was taken away by Chile in a bloody conflict for resources of the 19th century, and the desire to reintegrate the Pacific.
These hopes have perhaps been most powerful for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the opening of October of the International Court of Justice for a judgment of five years.
“The ball is at its side, flooded with the spirit of belonging and peace, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bulgarian diplomat.
With a lot of monitoring, the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the sister-in-law would be in favour of Bolivia and that Chile would be required to sit in a negotiating table after decades of rapprochement so that Bolivia could have its own access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic, indigenous President of Bolivia to face a conflicting fight to be continued for the next year's re-election, may lose a lot with the Monday judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, ” announced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not benefit Bolivia and that it would not change much if her decision were still favourable to Bolivia.
The United Nations in the Netherlands does not have the right to judge over Chilean territories and has also concluded in advance that it will not affect the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was only six months after the closing talks indicates that the case was not complicated, ” said Paz Zárate, an expert at international law in Chile.
Plus, for the past four years, she hasn't helped Bolivia's case, but she's still taking it back.
\"The maritime exit issue was referred to by the current Bolivian Government for its own ends,\" Zárate said.
“ Because of Morales’ enemy rhetoric, the remaining goodwill of Chilean people went away, ” he said.
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue after all.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former president, Mr Rodriguez Veltz, representing Bolivia in the Hague, disagreed with the finding that the judicial decision was unusually quick.
Monday, Bolivia offers a “exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in its relations with Chile, ” and a chance that both of them would come out well after “139 years of conflict, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who was still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the marine debate to make it a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific – she added.
– The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond what has been said in the past.
North Korea: No nuclear removal until they can trust America
According to the North Korean Secretary of State Ri Jongho, his country will not be the first to take down nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the UN General meeting on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made by the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore Summit.
He made the remark when it appeared that Mike Pampeo, U.S. Secretary of State, was able to reinitiate the dreaded nuclear negotiations more than three months after the summit in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Jongun.
Ri says, \"I want to.\" I believe that the constant sanctions and the declaration closing the Korean war will ever be enough to force North Korea into its knees.
Washington is changing the acceptance of the declaration if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards removal.
All Kim Jongun and Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, large-scale scepticism involves Phenjan's commitment to installing the arena, which is considered to be the sole key to the country's security.
Pampeo is planning a phenjani visit for next month to prepare for another Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows are the huge headgear that will soon appear in top-class shops.
If you want to expand your hat collection or want to completely cover the day, you will not have to look for it anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/summer collection in 2019, which was accepted by the fashion-style audience in Paris with great enthusiasm.
There are no practical hats on Instagram this summer, and these fashion designers have also set out their noticeable works.
Valentino's most visible piece was an overrun beige hat that was penile, wide carima decorated and almost completely swallowed the head of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements appeared with precious stone, a magic hat, and even an anaesthet, which were not really designed to keep the head of man warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizar masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were sewn up in their mouths, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than of haute couture.
One of these was similar to a dive mask, filled with pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melting jar with ice cream.
If you get these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
According to the style analysts, the huge caps are already on their way to the upper class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path of La Bomba, a 60 - cm - wide armal hat we've all seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultmark behind the few practical hats on the social side presented another piece on the runway: a sauna-made beach bag, almost as large as a bathing suit.
The dark orange rafia bag, decorated by rafia bots, was one of the outstanding pieces of the Jacquemus Spring/June 2019 collection of La Riviera in Paris in fashion week.
The stylist of stars, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect that by next summer, huge hats and beach bags will appear in the top category of clothing stores. The designer has created an essential effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language Knowledge is essential for world citizens
The new high-level exam results have traditionally been provided by independent schools. In view of this situation have not changed to 2018, which is only further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other Community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 students learn in institutions of this kind represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) who strive to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where there is scope for designing and introducing tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak in a language that you understand, you will reach your head.
But if you speak her language, it reaches her heart.
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations and trust with those from other countries.
This year's examination results show that students from independent schools have produced the best results from foreign languages across the country.
68% of all students studying a foreign language achieved a higher degree (more than 85 percent).
Based on the data collected from 74 members of the SCIS, 72 percent of students have received a higher degree from Mandarin, while 72, 69 of the French and 63 percent of Spanish students have reached the degree A.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as essential knowledge, which will undoubtedly need their knowledge of children and young people in the future.
Today, languages such as selected objects have become as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics as both independent and otherwise schools.
The UK Employment and Training Committee's 2014 survey showed that, according to 17% of employers, the loading of empty positions is difficult due to the lack of language recognition.
We can also see that knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary to allow young people to pursue a successful career.
Since more and more jobs are waiting for the knowledge of foreign languages, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career you choose, if you learn a foreign language, you will gain a lifelong knowledge from which you have a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalists will automatically provide a competitive advantage to applicants speaking in several languages.
According to the YouGov survey, in which 4000 adults were asked in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak to others in any foreign language, and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% (15 percent) of respondents.
That is why it is important that we put emphasis on teaching children the language.
Talking in several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children who can apply for more important work as adults.
In Scotland, they will deal with different languages at all schools.
Many schools will focus on modern classical languages, while several will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of great importance for the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the child's interests, it will be possible to learn several languages at independent schools and be trained as teachers who are experts in their territory.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children who prepare and provide them with the skills they will need to succeed, to keep whatever the future is.
It is not difficult to see that languages continue to be essential for the future of a country in the current global business environment, and this education must also reflect.
As a matter of fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools offer the possibility of choosing, diverse and quality education for Scottish young people.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it must be.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's going to San Diego on Sunday with Lakers.
They don't have to wait much longer for fans sitting around looking at LeBron James first in Los Angeles Lakes.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James was going to play the Sunday opening event at the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's gonna spend on the field is still a questionable question.
“ More than one and less than 48, ” wrote Walton on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, used to check that James would probably play for a limited period of time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans were with Lakers in the six-way season.
“I don’t have to play for the first season at this point in my career, ” she replied.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will start a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of Trump's five incarnated events next week, including stoppages such as his support for Tennise and Mississippi.
Now that it has been delayed by a vote confirming the candidate of the Supreme Court's disbarred seat, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the next half-time elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over Congress when votes run in November.
When does Trump start tonight's Western Virginia event, and where can he follow online?
His statement to the Trump Wheeling (Nyugat-Virginia) begins at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's Western Virginia meeting can also be followed online through live broadcast of YouTube.
Trump is likely to be affected by his supreme candidate, Brett Kavanaugh's weekly hearing, which proved particularly tense in the light of the charges of sexual harassment, and the Senate's confirmed vote was suspended for up to one week until the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary objective of the sudden growth events is to help the Republican situation before the November elections.
According to Trump’s campaign advisor, the next week’s five events serve the activation of “votes and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority currently owned in the Senate and the Assembly, ” says Reuters.
“In order for Congress to be able to be able to control, the president is so critical of his political plans that he is visiting as many states as possible. He has reported to Reuters a campaign call for his name hearing.
The Wheelingi Wesbanco event is scheduled for Argentina tonight, from the countries of Ohio and Pennsylvania, it can bring support and even be included in the media announcements of pittsburg, says the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will be the second time in the last month to visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Republican, Patrick Morrisey, who according to the surveys is not in a good position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should personally intervene to better present the surveys, ” said Simon Haeder, politician of the Western Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team fights with full shoulder in front of Sunday individuals to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts, Ryder Cup needed four matches Saturday afternoon.
The flying shirt of luck and moment here and there is a sport concept that has been quite aired, yet all players believe in it, mostly in races like Ryder-kupa.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had six-point driving, and they had only four advantages, so we could say that the ball is at our disposal, ” Jordan Spieth said, walking away at the end of the day.
With four points, of course, Europe is still leading, and there are 12 more available.
The Americans, as Spieth tells, feel that they finally got a little back, and they can encourage more than anything, including the forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they both got three out of the four.
Spieth proved impenetrable from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His noble victory crys became louder and more loud as he went along with the circle, found and balanced by a critical rink in the fourth game, so that after two Thomas and Thomas were in double disadvantages.
The game-Dealing curl of the 15th hole resulted in a similar exclamation of joy, a kind that can make the viewer think that the American team isn't lost yet.
“You only have to dig deep in yourself and care about your own game, ” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's still waiting for players.
18 holes for the chance that you'll be left with a trace.
Over the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple in Ryder Cup, could score more than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe is strange, but it's a couple of four out of four, and it seems they can't make any mistakes.
“Moliwood was the only pair who didn’t perform above the par on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at the last nine stages.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics that have developed between them and them, they have become the measure by Sunday, and no one expects the sun to secure Europe's victory on Le Golf National's track with rest than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing would be a win in different holes at once.
However, the European victory would be early to celebrate.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly executed by Sergio García, the fourth hero of the morning, when Alex Norenne and I played together.
Once with two blows over the par, the first nine holes were spanish and Swedish, which hit them in a wave valley where they had no chance of climbing out.
On Sunday, there won't be anyone to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball games and the four-ball matches are extremely entertaining from close to the pair's interactions. You can listen to what advice you give, what you don't give, and how you can change the strategy during a blink.
Europe has played better as a team, and it has a significant advantage for the last day, but this section of the 4th show that the U.S. team has the kurassi to fight, even though many of them are missing from the American side, especially from the US side.
Europe will start the last day of Ryder Cup with 10-6 advantages
Europe can start the last day of Ryder Cup with a good advantage after having closed the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday with a result of 10-6 against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the bow, bringing two victorys against the vulnerable Tiger Woods, bringing the difference to four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, which tries to recover the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the continuous U.S. team against the four-ball games in the morning, winning the series 3-1.
America has shown greater resistance in the fours, bringing two games, but they have not been able to suppress the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel who won four points in the series, while he and Molinari, who, after a sensational weekend, are only mentioned as \"Molliwood\", the second pair of Ryder Cup history, which received four points at four opening matches.
After they beat the Woods-Patrick Reed pair in the four-balls, with their great team game, the unmotivated Woods and the American newcomer, Bryson Dechambeau doubles for a fixed 5&4.
Woods, who attracted himself to two fights all Saturday, sometimes he's mutilated his talent, but he's already lost 19 of the four-ballers and four-persons, seven of which.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning four-balls, returned to her partner, Henrik Stenson, and by the fourth two-and-a-four, was defeated by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third ranked partner in the world list.
However, Europe did not succeed in doing everything on this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time titler Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans two points on Saturday how to do this.
A two-and-a-half victory was won against the pair of Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls, and then returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4/3 after losing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, only twice a team managed to return from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although Furyk's title team has a tie to keep the trophy.
However, after two days only the second best has been achieved, a Sunday attack seems to be quite unrealistic.
‘Distributing North Korea unilaterally if you do not trust your negotiating partner
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations that maintaining sanctions only increased the lack of confidence in the United States of America and that, under such circumstances, the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has taken significant and ambitious steps during the last year, for example, to stop nuclear and missile experiments, to close the site of nuclear experiments, and to promise not to expand its nuclear arsenal and scope of nuclear technology.
“Alas, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” he said.
– Without confidence in America, we feel that our nation's security is not guaranteed, and under such circumstances it is not possible to take down unilaterally and first -
Although Ri re-expressed North Korea's frustration about Washington's resistance to the idea of nuclear decommissioning, which, according to a scenario, would receive North Korea's rewards for the steps it has taken so far, its statement seemed significant, because it did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear decomposition, as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jongun and Donald Trump at the earliest summit between a powerful American president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, during which Kim promised to work “on the nuclear installation of the Korean peninsula, ” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s inviolence.
North Korea is trying to make an official point at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but according to the United States of America, Phenjan must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has not allowed strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with a nuclear installation and increase the pressure to force his will on us, and that he also protests against making it manifestable to end the war, ” Ri said.
– The idea of imposing sanctions on us is a desire for those who do not know us.
The problem is that non-relief sanctions just increase our suspicions,
Ri did not mention that it would be planned for a second summit between Kim and Trump, but which the President of the United States spoke separately at the beginning of the week.
The Minister pointed out that three meetings were held between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Dzein during the last five months and added: “If the nuclear country concerned was South Korea, not the United States, then the nuclear installation of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a sin position, ”
Nevertheless, the sound of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the target of the North American continent was inevitable by North Korean missiles after Trump, “the evil president, Kimet, described him as a missile man, who was on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “full destruction ” last year, threatened Kim with praise that he had the courage to take steps towards removal, but also noted that there was still a lot of work left to be done and that sanctions would remain until North Korea completed its nuclear decommission.
On Wednesday Trump said that no time limit was set, that is, \"If it takes two years, three years or five months, no matter\"
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have been taken so far.
On the other hand, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pope, said on Thursday in the UN Security Council: “The sanctions of the Security Council need to be respected as long as they have not achieved the actual, final, proven nuclear decommission.
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea to reduce the financing of Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
He met Rí at the UN General Assembly break and then said he was going back to Phenjan in the next month so that he could prepare for the second summit.
He's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip hasn't been very successful.
After leaving Phenjan in July, however, North Korea later accused him of “proposals like a gangster. ”
In the framework of the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to take down a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States also took appropriate steps.
According to Mun, the ‘promotional steps’ mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore or steps that could lead to the normalisation of the link with Washington.
Harvard students are being trained to get enough rest
A new subject at Harvard University this year, he used to push students to sleep more and more, fighting the whole night-long learning of caffeine is becoming more and more of a gainful mascot culture.
An academic concluded that students from the world’s first university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course, which he thought was the first of these training in the US, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who trained in sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and practised as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of the course to give a talk earlier on the impact of sleep-making on learning.
“A girl finally came to me and asked: ‘Why am I only now facing this as a senior?’
He said that nobody ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told Telegraph.
During the first course launched this year, students will be informed of the fundamental impact of appropriate sleep habits on their study and sports performance, in addition to the positive impact on their general public.
According to Paul Barreira, professor at Harvard School of Medicine, and head of university health services, the university decided to take up the course because during the week, students were found to be extremely illegitimate.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
For example, one shows a photo of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, gym shoes, and books to get acquainted with the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance affects sleeplessness, and why it is important for bedtime routine.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They show an interactive map of the university field with an interactive icon to guide participants into their daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we think that they have the right to such knowledge, as well as the right to know about the health effects of smoking, ” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which learning a night or night is expected to grow is still flourishing, he said, adding that modern technology and the constant pressure on students will result in growing problems of sleeplessness.
Sufficient and high-quality sleep is the secret weapon of students in their struggle for stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and even obesity, as sleep loss forces the brain to starve and causes a sense of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler in developing the course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysicals, and last year, Harvard was the first to record a professor's course.
He said that that was where the eyes were opened, and they encouraged him to swordfish along with the launch of a university-level training.
He hopes that as a next step, post-gradual students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before they arrive in the competition sector.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students set a warning to lie down, wake up, and meet the harmful effects of electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily break them out of the rhythm of the day and make it difficult for them to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and makes a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga bombed Steven Gerrard to lose 1-0 in Livingston.
The ibrox tried to get their first foreign victory after the February 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat from Gary Holt's team as manager of the 18 games, leaving Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship) at eight points.
Menga struck me seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers' unmotivated team hasn't been able to match up yet.
While the Rangers slipped to the sixth place, the Livingston caught up on the third, simply because of the difference between the goal and the hibernia.
In addition, Rangers may face additional difficulties after the coastmark Calum Spence's head injury has caused medical care due to a probably dropped object from the guest's surveillance.
Gerrard changed at eight points on the team that got into the pre-final of the Betfred Cup by pushing Ayr.
Holt was on the run with the same 11 people in Livingston, who took a point from the Hearts last week, and would have been happy to watch his dedicated team strangled his opponent's game where he was.
Even though the Rangers led the ball fight, the Livingston took over what he acquired.
The first two minutes you could've gotten a go at him when he started Scott Pittman by first handing Menga to the gate of Allan McGregor, but the middle-fielder couldn't sell the bar.
Keaghan Jacobs landed on Craig Halket's team captain, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control of the same thing, but there was more hope in the last three of them than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved to be a criminal in the 15th minute when he confronted Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson got rid of the Colombian complaints.
The Rangers could only show up at the first two half-time gates, but the former ibroxi gateman Liam Kelly had hardly any problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Liv's attempt to face up to the game in 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserve the chance, just for their hard work.
The Rangers have once again missed by a man who was forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who was great at finding Menga for easy endings.
Gerrard decided at the break, Coulibaly was replaced by Ryan Kentre, and this almost immediately explained his influence on the game when he jumped the windmill Morelos, but Kelly, bringing a fascinating form, was blocked in time.
The Livingston continued to be able to play exactly the kind of game that was suited to him, and Lithgow and Halket were sweeping up the long balls after each other.
Holt's team could've had a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good grip on the net and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow came up with a nail.
Glenn Middleton, acting as a Rangers exchange, tried to fight another elevens when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson was not convinced.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter
One detail “a day after the morning of our almanachitus: 30 September 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... the day when the later physics, John Wilhelm-Hans, was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that could have been created by a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been one of the main tools of science since then, and thanks to the 1950 film, strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, “Bells of Coronado has become part of the pop culture:
Man: “What a miracle is this?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. Radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on this headphone, you can hear the sound of the atoms that are released because of the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: “Listen to me, it's a bit of a patty now, ”
\"Hans, Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, he continues to live in his name - bearing invention.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “tape ” the abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “spray ” and destroy abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to detect abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that the immune cells should be obtained from the patient and then changed in a laboratory.
Thus they can ‘ see ’ the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers, and the treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who has been treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells may have died of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method is part of the recovery of immune cells from the patient; it is modified in the laboratory to ‘see’ the protein HER2, which is a frequent accompanying to various types of cancer; and then to restore the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the National Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, based on raising the immune cells and “teaching them, is based on how to attack cancer cells, has been used successfully in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
Kanye West SNL, a member of the MAGA cap, was ranked as a Trumpot supporter in a depraved tirada.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was suffocated in the Saturday Night Live studio after an uninterrupted demonstration of the US President Donald Trump and announced that in 2020.
After making the third song of Ghost Town that night in the hat of Make America Great Again, he began to speak against the Democrats and re-emphasises Trump's support.
“When I talk to someone who is white, I ask: ‘How do you like Trump because he is racist?’
If I was interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, ” he said.
The SNL's show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which the Hollywood Star Guild was set up by Brett Kavanaugh in his testimony to the Senate Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment charges.
Although it wasn't broadcast, Chris Rock's humorist downloaded the video of West's speech on social media sites.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to fire a gun from West with the charger.
West even complained to the audience about him being stabbed behind the scenes for his hat.
\"They scared me behind the scenes.
They said, \"don't go out in that hat.\"
They scared me!
And they said I was in the sank place,\" said the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a hidden place? I'm going to wear my Superman cape, because that means they can't say what to do.
Try with love “
At least twice his manifestations were accompanied by a whistleblower from the audience, and the SNL seemed to have been embarrassed by one of the Witnesses who said to Variety: “The entire studio was quiet and silent.
Instead of being a singer of Westet Ariana Grande, he was invited to the last moment, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days ago.
The West raised questions when he gave his song I Love it, dressed as Perrier glasses.
West, Candace Turner, leader of the Conservative TPUSA Group, assured support for one week: “One of the bravest spirits:
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, was saying that West was simply “you and that’s great, ”
\"But I have decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of music or fashion articles or the support of his \"artist\") who I believe is a ideology that is harmful to the community I belong to.
He's free.
But we, too, put it to him.
Before the show the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he’s “a creature known as Kanye West ”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and then he's into Diddy's prints, which we know as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
Rapper mate Snoop Dogg also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course, the late legend, Prince, also changed his name to a symbol, and then the artist they used to know as Prince.

Kit Harington, star of the Thrones' battle, finds over-manship harmful.
Kit Harington is known for the battle of the Thrones as Jon Snow, and in the middle-aged fantasy series of HBO violence, it is often the sword itself.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke against the stereotic macho heroes, highlighting that, in view of such heroes, young boys often feel that hard action is necessary to combat respect.
In his statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought it was “something went wrong, ” and he asked how the problem of the harmful effects of past manhood in the #MeToo era could be addressed.
The star who recently married her 31-year-old colleagues, Rose Leslie, said she thought it was very important to fix the problem.
“How has this case, how has this been so distorted personally? ” the actor asked.
– What we taught men when they were young about the problem we are facing now,
According to Kit, television is also responsible for spreading the distorted image of manhood, as the programmes often feature very Masculine characters.
Commenting on, he added: “What is it that was born with us, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and TV say to young boys that make them feel like they can only be men like this?
I think this is one of the big questions of our day – and how we can change it.
Because it clearly shows that something is not right with young men,
Kit stated in the interview that after the summer season in the series, no Thrones will be present in the series or series of events in Harca because he is “out of the warriors and horses ”
He will play the main role in the reprocessing of the film of Kit Sam Shepard True West from November, which is about a producer and his brother who continues to steal it.
The actor told me that the best thing he ever got from the Throne's battle was his wife Rose, who she met when she was making the show.
“I met my wife on film, so I could thank my future family and my future life for the series, ” said Kit.
Rose Ygritte, who was Kit's character, Jon Snow, was the love of Emmy's prized fantasy series.
The couple married Leslie's family estate in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new patients in China
China reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
According to health officials, this represents more than 820 000 people.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by around 40,000.
Compared to the previous, a change is that a significant majority of newly infected people are sexually transmitted.
The disease spread rapidly through the spillage of blood in some parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Jünnan Province said that the number of such cases had fallen to almost zero since then.
Nevertheless, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
The transfer of HIV sexually is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
As of 1997, homosexuality has been no crime in China, but discrimination against society has been very strong.
Based on estimates in various studies, the conservative trend in the country has led to 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men finally marry a woman.
In these respects, the disease covers in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
The Chinese Government has been providing universal access to anti-HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff would have leaked data from Republican senators and condemned “hazardous lies ” and“ interconspirators ”
On Saturday, American Congressman Maxine Waters rejected the accusations that a member of his staff published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Senators' Wikipedia site.
According to the Democratic Representative of Los Angeles, the claims in question were disseminated by experts and websites from the widest side.
“A lie, a lie, and more fiery lies, ” said Waters on Twitter.
The information provided was reported to have included the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information was released to the Internet on Thursday. The publisher's person is unknown, but he is sure that they were published on the Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of sexual harassment, the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pundi and RedState, are linked to the source IP address Waters' office, and are also reported from a member of Waters' staff, says The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying – continued by Waters.
– My staff has no liability for leaking information. However, the right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been injured by fraud and false charges.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying.
Waters' statements on the Internet were soon adapted to criticism, including the critics, Ari Fleischer, former press secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial – wrote Fleischer.
– Based on this, it appears that Waters does not have the blood temperature necessary for his representative's duties.
If someone is convicted of something he didn't do, he can't react angry.
You can't be rude.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm,
Waters' reaction seems to have been compared to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to the democratic criticisms of the party who, some critics say, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for representatives of Waters during the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If true, it’s serious, ” he wrote.
Waters, in his communication, wrote that his office informed the “adequate authorities and law enforcement authorities” about false accusations.
“We want the perpetrators to know – continued Waters – and to be legally held accountable for all acts that endanger or injure any member of the staff of my staff –
Johnny English hits again, or Rowan Atkinson's paralytic spy game
Today, it has become a tradition that we are looking for references to Brexit in any British-related film, and there is no exception to this category of action violin/paródia category, which was re-filled in 2011 by Johnny English 2003, and Johnny English re-enacted.
Will the British nation become the new export product of sarcastic satirs paring ourselves in which we live on our own obvious paralytics?
So far it is certain that Mr Johnny English has had enough mutation for a new return with the rigid, rubber-faced, incapacitated memory – it is also clear from his name that this comedy character has been created to make the masses of the world's non-English countries laugh at the cinemas.
Johnny English, of course, is a stumped secret agent who thinks he's a winner of bizarr's motility, so he reminds me of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and sometimes of the guy who was involved in the performance of the main title of the fire striker at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
The character was originally also based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-timelyly-supervised Barclaycard commercial, who left chaos everywhere.
There's a couple of good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approaching toward a helicopter, and then, coming up, the rotors fell on their helmets for a few moments.
Atkinson's comedy brother is well placed in the film, but the humor of the film doesn't really work, even to the point, because today, it's like James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series, which appeal to the instrument of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and to me, Johnny English flopping, successful adventures do not reach the level of idealism and genius that Atkinson brings to me in the silent scenes of Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is permanent: Great Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercrime broke into the super secret network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to Kevin Eldon's biggest nightmare, who unfortunately only had such a small role in the film.
This may be the last angle in the coffin of the Prime Minister of Self-Translation and Sharing, whose political popularity is otherwise in ruins: Emma Thompson practically forms Theresa May and makes everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
The intelligence advisors show him that, given that every active agent has been identified, he's gonna have to put a tranquilized agent on the job.
This quiet agent, of course, is a double-hull Johnny English who has been working as a teacher since his retirement, but, by way of derogation from the educational material, teaches children spying – here are, of course, funny scenes, while English afloatsuli describes the basics of spying.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he will meet with his former, much-murder, Bough, who is now being formed by Ben Miller, at the emergency briefing.
Bough has been married since then, and married the captain of a submarine, whose mouth is always in the ear – the captain is made by Vicki Pepperdine, who has called for much better roles than this.
His Majesty’s National Security Service, Baltman and Robin, will then return to action and will face Ophelia Bulletova, who the beautiful Olga Kurylenko forms as a true destiny woman.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is becoming increasingly ensnared by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve the digital problems of Britain: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy forms.
English and Bough will begin their clown mission: they will set fire to a fancy French restaurant, and then, in the midst of an amazing turn, they will embroide themselves on the luxury yacht of Volta, and English will release the hell when they try to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR-head.
These stations need us to get to the finals, but whatever it takes to find joy and turn, it may be a little too much of a child's movie.
The end result is pretty mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English movies, the question has just been raised: Can the British film industry finally play a talented role in Rowan Atkinson?
The British Labour Party refuses to introduce a four-day working week while paying the British for a five-day wage.
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical project to introduce a four-day work week, with workers working for five days' salary.
The party claims that the workers would also like to benefit from the artificial intelligence (MI) revolution by providing employees with an extra day off thanks to increased income.
According to the draft, employees would receive a three-day weekend while taking them home as much as before.
According to the sources, the idea would be to include the party's economic programme, which aims to cut the balance sheet language on the side of the workers in the country.
Congress of Trade Unions supports the four-day work week's idea, so workers can profit from the changing economy.
One of the senior officials of the Labour Party stated to the Sunday Times: “It is likely that the policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to another, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party's program that would set the balance sheet language for the workers in the economy, it also fits the party's overall industrial strategy.
It would not be the first of the Labour Party, which supports such an idea, the Green Party has been campaigning for four-day work week in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The spokesperson of the Labour Party said: “The four-day work week does not fall within the policies supported by the party, and the question is not even on the agenda –
John McDonnell, Minister of Shadow Finance at the Labour Party Conference last week, presented his vision of the socialist revolution affecting the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from “unfortunate directors, ” and from the ‘ beneficiaries of the regime, ’
If the shadow finance minister's plans were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water service companies would not recover the full profits they would receive, because a Labour Government would make cuts as a punishment for these harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he was planning to make employees a member of the board of directors, and would create an Inclusive Ownership Fund, which would group 10% of the shares of private companies to employees who could thus obtain 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy were informed about the possibility of changing their opinion as regards the investigation into Kavanaugh by the FBI.
As a result of an FBI investigation into charges against Brett Kavanaugh, a final vote on the election of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Judge will be held at least one week later than the original date.
In his interview with \"60 Minutes,\" Sunday journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to change their mind.
Kennedy was less committed than a South Carolina colleague.
\"I understand, of course,\" said Kennedy.
That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the explosion of the case, after the accusations came out, and I asked, \"You did?
His response was strong and clear –
Graham's vote seems to be concrete.
“I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and there would be extremely serious accusations to change my mind,” said Graham.
– Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied the claims – he added Graham to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named Dr. Ford proved the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new would turn out to be...
What is a Global Citizens Festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
The annual musical event, the Global Citizens Festival, will begin in New York on Saturday. World stars will perform for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will now be held on a week-to-week basis, and there are expected to be thousands of Central Park's Grand Pásit, where participants will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also pay attention to the real purpose of the event: the eradication of deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival was first organized in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international interest group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing numbers of people involved in the active fight against poverty.
Free tickets to the concert are available (unless they are willing to pay for VIP tickets) to perform certain tasks or transactions, such as making voluntary work, sending e-mails to a leading politician, a telephone call, or any other material activity that may draw attention to the project's objective: eradicating poverty.
But how successful has global citizen actually been in achieving the objectives set in the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concerts to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just a new form of \"clitivism\" when people feel that they have contributed to a case by signing or writing an online petition?
Since 2011, more than 19 million actions have been carried out by project supporters, which have served a number of different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to separate world leaders from the anti-poverty policies and commitments that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that they came from their actions, including $10 billion already paid or collected in the fund collection.
According to Group estimates, the money collected has been directly affected by nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and contractors based in the United Kingdom, which aims to “help children achieve the potential inside of them” to help Rwanda eliminate hunger of $35 million after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from \"global citizens\".
“With the support of the UK Government and donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can banish social injustice and malnutrition among the footnotes of history books, ” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition at a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also claims that after more than 5,000 actions have been requested to improve the food of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the feeding of 5 million women and children.
Frequently published on the Global Citizens’ Website, one of the following questions is: “Why do you think deep poverty can be eliminated?
According to the Global citizen’s answer: “There will be a long and difficult journey, which sometimes leads us to fail and sometimes fail.
But as with previous civil and anti-territorial movements, we too reach our goal because together we are stronger,
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will perform at this year's New York event, and the programme managers will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of Home Affairs: the United States Marine Block would use Russian energy exports to prevent
“If necessary, Washington would also use the Navy to put Russian energy carriers on the market, such as Russia’s energy from the Middle East, ” said U.S. Minister Ryan Zinke of the Interior, Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's active presence in Syria – in particular, as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government – is only an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only there because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe, ” said Zinke in a statement.
And the Minister of Interior says there are methods of preventing the Russians.
“The United States of America has the ability to ensure that maritime routes are open and can block them, if necessary, so that it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter markets, ” Zinke said.
Zinke has taken part in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
In his speech, Washington compared his action against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same method.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically quite the same way: through the use of existing energy sources and the introduction of new ones, ” Zinke said, while calling Russia “one-dimensional economy, ” pointing to the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements are consistent with the Trump Government's plan to export LNG to Europe, thus limiting Russia to the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the leading officials of the Trump government, including the President himself, will convince Germany to reverse the project called North Stream 2, behind which, if implemented, will then make Moscow a hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity was doubled, with an increase of 110 billion cubic metres, the North Stream 2 line was exclusively a project of an economic nature.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is against such a project from economic considerations, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
“I take the view that we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure exercise and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely, ” said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister of Energy after a September meeting with the US Minister of Energy in Moscow.
The attempt to convince Americans went backwards, because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI) has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy, as is the way to keep itself out of bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third country intervenes in our energy affairs, ” said Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI), after the last meeting of Dieter Kempf.
Mr Warren's Masschustts Senator has taken a serious consider to take office for the Presidency in 2020.
On Saturday, Senator Warren Masschusetts said that after the midterm elections, he would be “examined in such a way that he could go for the presidency.
During a town meeting in Warren Massachusetts, holyoke, he confirmed that he was considering his departure.
“It is time for women to get into Washington and repair the bad working government, and it is also time for a woman to be president,” Warren said The Hill.
– After November 6, I am seriously considering going for the Presidency –
At the town meeting, Donald Trumpot was holding Warren's criticism, and he said that he thought it was a bad way to go.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy, ” Warren said.
Warren put a lot of criticism on Trumpot and Brett Kavanaugh's highest court-appointed candidates.
In a Friday Twitter message Warren wrote, \"of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote,\"
However , based on a survey published on Thursday , the majority of Warren's masschustsi voters do not think Warren should start for the Presidency in 2020.
According to 58% of the voters who voted for the Warren-good chance, based on a survey by the Political Centre of Suffolki University and Boston Globe, the Senator should not be going for the Presidency, while:
32% are in favour of Warren's presidential election.
On the basis of the survey, the former governor of Deval Patrick would be in favour of a large majority of the people asked and 38% would be opposed to 48%.
As regards presidential elections in 2020, the name of high-ranking democratic politicians, such as Joe Biden's former Vice-President or Senator Bernie Sanders' Vermonti, has also appeared.
According to the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to leave until January.

18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the review of the new American asylum policy, which states that they cannot receive asylum from gangs or from domestic violence.
Experts from 18 different Member States and representatives from Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter on Fridays in Washington to support a asylum seeker who attacks politics in court, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant for the case of Grace vs Sessions, initiated against federal policy by the US Civil Society Union in August, has not been published.
According to the plaintiff, his partner and his sons of violent crime were assaulted, but American officials rejected his asylum application on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
The prosecutors of the states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guadeloupe as places from which many asylum applications have been submitted to the United States, since in these countries there is a constant problem with the violence committed by the criminals and within the family.
The new American asylum policy withdrew the decision taken by a Commission of Immigration Appeal 2014 (BIA) to request asylum for non-documented migrants to flee domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General, stated in a Friday's communication that the new policy had been ignored by several decades of state, federal and international law.
\"All asylum applications under federal law shall be treated in accordance with the facts and circumstances applicable and an obstacle to this principle shall be infringed by a letter of experts.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that policy to refuse immigration harm the American economy, because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to fill the lowest-level jobs.
In June, Advocate General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum judges not to give asylum to victims of domestic violence and criminal gangs.
\"The right to asylum is the one who leaves his country because of race, religious grounds, nationality, belonging to a specific social group or fear of persecution or persecution,\" said the Senate when it announced the policy on 11 June.
The right to asylum has not been developed to solve all problems that people around the world have to face every day, and they are also of any serious nature.
Desperate rescue in Palub, the number of deaths doubled, rescue movements running a race over time
The situation of survivors is becoming more and more unexpected.
“Everybody is very tense, ” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while calming down the feverous little boy, in the centre of an evacuation of Palu.
- The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We hardly have any drinking water.
Some residents returned to their destroyed home to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals that have also been damaged by a 7.5 earthquake will not be able to take care of people.
Some of the injured, including the broken-back and shoulder Dwi Harist, were transferred to the Palui Military Hospital. The patients were visited outside the hospital because of the major retrofittings.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he recalled the fifth floor hotel room in which he was staying with his wife and daughter, in which he was terrified.
“There was no time for escape.
I think I was in need of broken walls – said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family came to town for a wedding.
- I heard my wife cry for help and then she shuts up.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope you're safe.
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of scaring the country with propaganda ads
The United States Ambassador of China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the American press. This was a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper that highlighted the mutual benefits of American-China trade relations.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to his announcement in the China Daily Des Moines Register, the largest copy of Iowa's history, whereas he accused China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is attempting to intervene in the US elections, according to some American officials who have declared Reuters, is a new stage in Washington's ever-growing action against China to put China under pressure.
Although it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, there is an ever more intensive trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which they impose new and new duties on each other's import products.
According to US and Chinese experts at the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese customs duties as a response sought to target exporters from countries in which Trump and the Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador of China and Iowa's former governor for several cycles said that Beijing damaged US workers, farmers and businesses, because the State of Iowa exported a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his article on the Des Moines Register on Sunday, that “China is still scaring our country by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press ”
“The Chinese Government exploits the highly respected American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads placed in the Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
However, if we go to a Beijing newspaper store, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not truly reflect the different opinions of Chinese people on the growing growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Communist Party of China.
Branstad added that “one of China’s most famous newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not mention the newspaper.
They say that Republicans can emigrate women voters with Kavanaugh before the midterm elections.
According to speakers, many high-level Republican politicians can defend Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate in cross-border cases of sexual harassment. In particular, women's voters may lose their support before the mid-term elections.
The case caused intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn – says Grant Reeher, a politician working in the institution of Maxwell School at the University of Sicily in the Saturday article of The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the last-minute FBI search by Jeff Flake Republican Senator in Arizona would be sufficient to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – not tomorrow, nor in November – said by a Washington, D.C. resident newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, head of the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday.
According to Mic's announcement, on Friday morning in the Senate corridor, some protestors were saying: “We don't want to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“It will be an amazing leap from democratic enthusiasm and motivation, ” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“It is said that it has been extremely high so far, and that is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the insecure female voters in the suburbs and young people (18-29 years of age) who, although they are not enthusiastic about the president, often do not vote.
The analysts have already assumed before Ford's public testimony that he could go back to the Republicans, if they continue to stand by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described in detail in his statement why he accused the supreme court candidate with sexual harassment.
“At the beginning of last week, the Republican Party was wrong, ” said the NBC News, former president of Michael Steele, the Republican National Commission.
“Here it is not only about the Commission’s vote and the final vote, but also about the way the Republicans dealt with the case and, as they did with Ford, highlighted Guy Cecil, the US Director of Priority for the election of the Democrats.
It seems, however, that the Americans were quite divided in whether they considered Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony to be true, and that they believed Kavanaugh a little more than Ford.
According to the new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents fully or more believed Ford's testimony, while 35% of respondents in Kavanaugh gave the same answer.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents believe that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying in his statement, while only 30% of respondents from Ford believed that.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's statements, as is the statements made by another accused of Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez, on Guardian.
Ford swore a week ago before the Senate Committee on Justice that at the age of 17, Kavanaugh, drunkly stalked him.
Ramirez claims that the supreme court candidate had shown him his sex organs at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
A global web-generator would launch a new internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launches startups to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the Berners-Lee open source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he made a joke that the intention behind Inrupt “to gain control over the world ”
“We have to do it now – he said about startup.
- It's a historic moment.
The application enables people to create their own \"personal online database\", a POD, by means of Solid technology.
This may include lists, list of items, calendars, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are also available from the same browser.
In the personal online database, it is unique that the user can choose who has access to the data in its entirety.
The company calls it \"the enforcement of the self-regulation of personal data\".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company is responsible for providing resources, processes and adequate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contractors working in the project and a community of volunteers.
From this week onwards, world technology developers will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt side.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not ask \"Facebook and Google to take full-time change technology that would turn the entire business models of companies into the top of their heads from one day to another\".
\"We don't ask permission from them \"
In a register published on the Mediterranean Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that sending Inrupt to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Solidra-based network –
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consorcium at the Massachusetts Technical University.
Berners-Lee has been an important source of opinion over recent months in discussions on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am absolutely optimistic about the next era of the world network, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann Preacher, First World War Cross Cross, was celebrated
The only Cross of Victoria was celebrated by the Anglican pastor 100 years after he executed his heroism in World War I.
Bernard Vann, respected and alezred during the attack of 29 September 1918 in Bellellise and Leacourt.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he could never know that he earned the highest honor of British armed forces.
The two grandsons of the monumental stone for their respect have been exposed to the Saturday celebration of Northamptonshire County in Rushden.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that “it is symbolic, ” that the monument was given just after his 100 - year - old grandfather’s act of honor.
According to London Gazette, Bernard Vann, respected and alezred on September 29, 1918, he carried his flag on the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel – a ring of fog and a heavy cannon and machine guns –
Later, he rushed into the face and “extraordainous heroism ” stood at the edge of the flag, followed by a single-handed attack on a camper cannon, leaving three of its members in harmonizing.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper was shot at by Bernard Vann, a respected and abductor, just one month before the end of the war.
“I know that I can never reach what my grandfather did and that he taught me humility, ” said 72 - year - old Michael Vann.
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have confounded the Memorial stone.
Michael Vann said it was an honor to have played a part in the celebration and added: “The vigilance of a real hero shows how many people later express their respect. ”
The OCTs have been cheering up all night to check on Bellator 206's transmission, instead they got Peppa malaco.
Imagine he's been up all night trying to watch the exciting Bellator 206, and that's not gonna happen.
There were 13 matches on the San José show, six of which were broadcast live as part of the main event in the United Kingdom, Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight against each other, the Anglian viewers were not surprised by the game instead of the Peppa pig.
Many of these were made difficult by those who stayed up for the morning hours because of this attack.
Instead of the MMA game, she's got a baby cartoon on Twitter for one of the fans, some kind of sick joke.
According to the state legislation, this content can no longer be transmitted by 6 a.m. and therefore had to be switched to children's programmes – said Dave Schwartz, the head of the Bellator's communication and marketing department.
- Yeah, it's Peppa, the pig time,
Scott Coker, the president of the Bellator company, promised that in the future, the schedule of the show would be revised to take account of the UK viewers.
“I think we can solve this by repeating it, ” Coker said.
But since it's 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, until Sunday, which is Monday, we can't fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show turned over, there were a lot of messages, and so most of them weren't friendly.
At first we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But that wasn't what we were talking about. It was a legal problem.
But I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of six, there will be only five matches in the program – we would have liked to do it for the viewers, but we accounted for.
It was an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sexual orientation with minority complex
On Tom Daley's studio Olympics, he said that in his youth, he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but that's why he's convinced the motivation to succeed.
According to the 24 - year - old athlete, until high school, he did not realize that “not everyone is like him. ”
In the radio show Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told her to stand up for the rights of gays to give others a “happy. ”
He added that since he was a parent, the Olympics were much less interested.
The permanent programme leader Kirsty Young, who has been living for many years, has left several months for the disease.
In Laverne’s first show, “a broken ship, ” Daney said that as a youth, everyone else felt“ less, ” because “it was not accepted in society when one loved boys and girls, ”
He stated: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and other things is what I am drawing strength and strength to achieve my successes.
He wanted to prove that he was “no matter what he was worth, ” so that he would not disappoint everyone when the light was exposed to sexual orientation.
The double Olympic bronchial guerrilla became a well-known representative of the LGBT Community and, taking advantage of its role in this year's national community games in Australia, asked the world's governments to decriminise homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said that he spoke about the matter because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others “a hope. ”
The three-time world champions said that “it was quite surprising, ” when he fell in love with another man, the Dustin Lance Black American film maker, who was first met in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar award script writer got married last year and said that age difference never meant a problem among them.
“When so many things were going through man’s young age, ” he said, at the age of 14, his father died three years later in cancer, he found it difficult in his own age class to find someone who had similar extreme experiences.
He adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, according to Dale's own statement, he's completely turned his attitude to the world.
“If they asked me this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing was to win gold medals,” he said.
There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal, Robbie.
The child's name was Robert after Dale's father, who died in 2011, after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor at 40 years old.
Daley's statement that his father did not want to accept that he was going to die, and one of the last questions was whether they already had the tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to sit there in the first row.
“I was unable to answer him, ” he quoted, “Dad, you will no longer be in the first line.”
“ I kept his hand on him when he stopped breathing, but until the moment I couldn’t accept that my father was not vulnerable, ” he said.
The following year, Daley attended the Olympics in 2012, and he got my bronchice.
“I realized that this was what I've dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, and there’s no better feeling than that, ” he said.
The first of his chosen songs was inspired. Heather Small Proud (Byszke) helped him much during the Olympic preparation, and to this day, he's going to have a goose skin if he hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts at 11:15 on Sunday, local time, on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
The U.S. Phil Mickelson can set up a record by participating in the 47th cup game on Sunday in Ryder-kupan, however, you must win back the form if you do not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in your memory.
Mikelson's record has been played for 12th time at a two-year event, however, due to the performance of the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday, Jim Furyk's team captain sent the bench.
Instead of being at the centre of the events as many times as it had to fight for the victory of the United States, now in one half of the day his team is cheering up with half the practice of the other and trying to correct the mistakes that weaken his game.
At the top of Karrieje was never among the most accurate bats, so the 48-year-old player does not really have a narrow track of Le Golf National, where, due to the high grass, there is a very high price to pay for the flawed punches.
And if the track in itself wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the four games this week in the team with Tommy Fleetwood, who was starting to win the four games of Francesco Molinari.
If four-point Americans start hard before the 12 individual matches, Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“You are fully aware of the role that Furyk played in today’s development.
– Very confident.
She's one of the biggest, and she's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
I didn't mean for him two games, basically.
I have planned more, but we have decided that this is the best solution.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else.
With Mickson's Sunday play, he's gonna break Nick Faldo's record, and he's never played more games in the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series of Ryder Cups that are far below the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven tie-ups, but Furyk has pointed out that the presence of the veteran player has no tangible advantages for the team.
\"He's very, very sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with others, he's a great team member\" he explained.
– I think younger players enjoyed playing games against him, and it's good to see it.
His presence goes beyond the strict-minded game –
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their benefits
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone has a significant advantage for the last day of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn their backs on him.
The Danish player introduced a 1997 Valderrama match for the first time, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage against the Americans, and at the end, they just managed to keep a hairline advantage for winning between 141 and 31 to 212.
“We always have to remind ourselves that we have won a great advantage in Valderrama, but we won only a little bit, and we also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out, ” said Bjørn in the picture after the 5-3rd and yesterday victory of the 2018 class, which leads to 10-20 in Le Golf National.
– We've been thinking about previous years' competitions, and everyone can see that the game isn't over.
You're gonna have to play full power tomorrow.
So come on, and do all you need to win.
We can't loosen up until the points get on the board.
We have our goal, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to concentrate on right now.
As I said before, I deal mainly with 12 players on our team, but we must also look at the other side who happen to be among the world’s biggest players.
Bjørn, proud of the team’s performance on the hard track, added: “I would like to make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a different pasta.
Then it all depends on individual performances, which is completely different from team games.
It's great to play in a couple when things go well, but when you stand up individually, you'll find out in every way what kind of golfer you really are.
That's what you have to understand with players, that tomorrow you'll get the best out of your game.
They have to break up with their partner, who will also have to bring about the best form.
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of Jim Furyk, the opponent's team specifically trusts his players to do better in themselves than in a couple, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of the four.
According to Furyk, both sides of the last day's resurrections have been experienced: in Brookline he was a member of the winning team, and then on the losing side of the European team was the miracle of Medinah.
“I remember all the damned words – he answered when he was asked because before the last day, he encouraged the players to be team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
– We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we're going with a quick start as fast as we could see in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams really goes along, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent's players in the middle games.
That is how we put the order together and prepared our players to perform a real miracle tomorrow, ”
Thomas was given the task of getting the job translated into action, and Rory McIlroy is playing against the first game, then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are coming as the first half of the European team.
“I also decided to follow the order, because I think that’s how the picture was connected from the beginning to the end, ” Bjørn added.
Once again, the broadcast of Germany's latest warship has been postponed.
The German Navy's latest fractus should have been served in 2014 to replace the rising cold warships, but due to various system failures and the exponentially increasing costs, this has waited for you for at least next year.
The flag ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class fregatts was postponed to the first half of 2019, and the Die Zeit weekly wrote a letter from one of the military spokespersons.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy line in 2014, but continued delays have made it very difficult for the big project.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to place the Brema-classing Fregates.
We understand that it will be equipped with a high-fired cannon and with various anti-aircraft missiles and disguised technology, including a signal wiper that reduces the radar, infrared and acoustic signals of the ship.
Another important feature is that maintenance is less often needed, which in practice means that these latest Fregats can be put in service for up to two years away from mother restraints.
However, due to the ongoing slip of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany may be able to feel power overseas, are already obsolete when they are finally called upon to serve, noted Die Zeit.
The F125 fregat of the heavy fate last year was entered when the German Navy officially refused the start-up of the vehicle and sent it back to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship delivered to the manufacturer.
Not much information about the causes of the return has come to light, but the German media have more critical “Software ” and hardware errors, which make the warship unusable in a combat effort.
The software deficiencies represent a major problem, as only 120 sailors on the Baden-Württemberg class will serve only half the crew of the old Brema class.
It was also discovered that the ship is extremely overweight, which undermines its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000 tonnes Rheinland-Pfalz are reported to be twice as difficult as German ships of a similar class set up in World War II.
Apart from the flawed components, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the project cost has already reached the amazing amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) while the starting draft accounted for EUR 2.2 billion.
In light of the problems with new Fregats, it is particularly important that Germany's marine presence is reduced.
Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently admitted that the Navy has been running out of warships.
According to the civil servant, the problem has in the meantime become a self-destructive process because old ships have to be installed, but there are no more ships to replace the landings.
He expressed his concern about the fact that even one of the Baden-Württemberg class Fregates could join the Navy line.
National Trust is searching for the secret life of bats.
There's a new research going on a Scottish highland site to find out how bats use the landscape's characteristics while hunting.
Researchers hope that the results can provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which can also benefit from subsequent species conservation initiatives.
Scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will examine the behaviour of common and suckling midgets and brown long-sleeved bats and aquatic bats in Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points of the area, special reception devices are placed so that they can record the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will collect mobile data with manual detectors.
A detailed analysis of the sound of the recordings can determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species is doing.
Researchers will also draw up a habitat map and report, which will enable them to define in detail how animal behavior will develop depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS's conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitats for bats and how to use them.
This information will help to determine the beneficial effects of housing work, such as the development of rites, and how to best maintain forest areas for bats and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations has decreased significantly over the last century.
Buildings and territorial development works disrupt animal sleeping places and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, just as put-off paper, certain chemical procedures for building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their overnight predators, they are more dependent on their hearings when they are hunting for prude than on their sight.
They can define the exact position of insects and ground objects on their way with their sophisticated techniques based on the reversing of ultrasound.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings throughout the country, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, takes the question of bats very seriously.
They work with ten qualified professionals who regularly prepare studies and sleeper studies and participate at times in rescue work.
The organisation established the first and only dedicated denerial reserve of Scotland on Thraive birts in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bats of Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here inThreave, there is a great place for bats,” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else needed for a good living space.
But we do not know much about bats, and thanks to the work done here and in other areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel good about themselves.
He also highlighted the importance of making sure that there are bats living there before refurbishing buildings, as the destruction of a single facility could result in the destruction of 400 women and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The deners are forbidden to destroy, destroy, harass, and destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, also requested the help of the population.
He said: “We still have a lot to do about bats, and we do not have much information about the situation in most domestic species.
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, his lawyers sue against the German magazine.
Cristano Ronaldo’s news, “has been responsible for the rape against him, ” and he believes that others are trying to use his name to“ get involved in public knowledge ”
The football lawyer is ready to sue the German weekly, Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese member of the framework and the Juventus battlera were accused that in 2009 he raped an American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
She says the athlete paid her $375,000 to listen to the case, wrote to Der Spiegel on Friday.
33-year-old Ronaldo reported in an Instagram Live video a few hours after the charges were released, with 142-million fan camps, that the news “fear ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
The things that have come up against me today are all lies,\" said the five-time gold-ball player to the camera.
\"They want to use my name to get in public knowledge.
It happens.
They want to become famous with my name, the life of publicists.
I am a happy man, and my life is fine – the player added a smile.
Because of the claims that “unacceptable, private - life suspicion, ” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz’s lawyer’s statement, the player will lodge a claim for compensation “for the moral damage caused, to the extent that the severity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years, ”
The case was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in one of the suites of Las Vegas Palms Hotel and Casino.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man assaulted the woman anally, standing in documents lodged with Clark County District Attorney of Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo would kneel after the incident and told him that he was a “99 percent good boy, ” excluding“ a single percent. ”
On the basis of the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that he had sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that this had been done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police, and a hospital also made a visual report of his injuries, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because he “was afraid of being taken care of, as well as“ from being humiliated ”
A 34-year-old woman is now seeking to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by this case continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was just ahead of confirmation at the time of the alleged attack (from Real Madrid to Manchester United), and this summer, the giant in Italy, Juve, bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will forever be treated – the loss of car factories
The United Kingdom will “regarde forever, ” said Greg Clark, Minister for Business Affairs, when he loses his position as a world leader after Brexit.
He then added: “As a concern, ” he considers the UK statement to the BBC that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, the car manufacturer would have to temporarily stop production in the plant near Derby in Burnaston.
\"There is a need for an agreement,\" said Clark.
According to the Japanese automotive company, in the case of a non-agreed Brexit, jobs may be lost due to the fact that the border delays occur.
Last year, 150 000 cars were manufactured by the Toyota Auris and Avensis production units last year and 90% were exported to other Member States of the European Union.
\"I feel that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU by the end of March, it will take down production operations at the factory,\" said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concerns about the possibility that the country would leave the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, the BMW claimed that after Brexit, it would shut down the Minikek manufacturer's plant in Oxford for a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks posed by a non-agreemented Brexit in relation to the supply chain.
The Toyota production line operates on the basis of time and time, the components arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the United Kingdom and in other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the EU on 29 March without agreement, then cross-border disturbances can lead to production delays and lack of part of production according to industry representatives.
According to Toyota, in Derbyshire, it would be impossible to store enough parts for more than one day, so it should be stopped production.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU known as Theresa May Chequers is \"collected in such a way as to avoid any delaying checks at the border\".
“We need an agreement, and we want an agreement on the best possible conditions, which will not only be able to enjoy the fruit of our current success, but also offer new opportunities – he said in the BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only the Toyota, but also other producers can confirm that we definitely need a highly successful supply chain to maintain –
Toyota could not tell us how long production would last, but warned that the combined costs could damage the competitiveness of the factory, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvalris, who has worked for 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is currently active in the representation of the Unite trade union, the members of the trade union are increasingly concerned: “In my opinion, the jobs that will be lost will never be received again.
One government spokesperson said: \"We have developed a priority and feasible plan for future EU relations\".
You can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, tell me about the White House.
“You can postpone the next week, ” says the White House on Sunday, Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump, as the debate around the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller examining Russian influence, possible relations between Trump advisory and Russian government, and possible obstacles to justice by Trump.
In Washington, they've been thinking for months that Trump's finally lost the Deputy Attorney-General, putting Mueller in danger of being independent.
According to the New York Times's monthly announcement, Rosenstein considered that he would arrive at the meeting with the President, in order to record the discussion with the President, and the question raised whether it would be possible, on the basis of the 25th amendment of the Constitution, to change Trump.
Rosenstein denied the speakers.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and the speaker went to submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trumpp, whose appearance was then in front of the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would ‘ not be happy ’ to lose Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so as not to conflict with the Senate justice hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women suspected of having sex with him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, also witnessed.
On Friday Trump ordered a week's F.B.I. to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, with which the final Senate vote has been postponed.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We do not have a designated date for the moment, either by this week, but I also see another one - week delay in the light of the supreme court cases.
We'll soon find out, and as always, I'll let the press know...
However, some journalists doubted this statement: Sanders did not hold a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The show manager Chris Wallace asked about that reason too.
Sanders replied that the reason why the rareness of press conferences was not a feeling of resistance to TV reporters’ behaviour, but added: “I’m not arguing about the fact that they really are sensational hairs.
It then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and representatives of the press would be held more often.
“The president gave more questions and questions than any previous president, ” he said. He even added, without supporting the claim: “We looked back on the numbers, ” he said.
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is better with light years than if they talk to me.
We are often trying to get around and there have been many such events over the past few weeks, so they can talk to the President of the United States in person instead of the White Home Press Conferences.
Trump answers reports regularly when he leaves the White House or at public events, he may attend press conferences with the dignity of the visitor.
Press conferences alone, however, are rather rare.
Why, perhaps it can be seen from what happened this week, when President New York was producing a bolder role in New York before assembled journalists.
The head of the health wallet wrote to NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The head of the health wallet expressed the country’s gratitude to the staff from the countries of the European Union and stressed their hope that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the expected UK exit.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of claims for EU citizens in decentralised public services.
In Freeman’s letter, he wrote: “The negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued in the summer, which are expected to take place in the fall.
The UK Government has also taken steps to prepare a possible non-agreemented scenario.
I am aware of the alarming time this may be for you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries have valuable experience and expertise to help the work of the health wallet, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home, and we really want them to stay with us.

The Tensee State Tigers linebackerén, Christion Abercrombie, performed an emergency surgery after having a head injury at the 31-27 fight against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reported Mike Organ Tennsee.
The head coach of the Tennis State, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before midterm.
“He walked along the coastline and just fell, ” Reed said.
The training team and the medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the track, then they put it on a barrel, and they took it for further investigations.
One of Tensee State's competent authorities in Nashville, Pennsylvania, told Chris Harris, the WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond surgery performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “not yet know more details about the type and extent of the injury, ” while the Tennis State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie spends the first season of a second-year-old student who's been set off for a year in the Tensee State, where she's certified from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented five successful equipment before leaving the field, so he's already at 18 in the season.
Foreign customers will have to pay a higher tax on properties purchased in the UK
According to Toryk's new plan, foreign customers will have to pay a higher tax on real estate purchased in the United Kingdom and would support homeless people with additional income.
With this step, I would neutralise Corby's success among young voters.
The increase in taxes is aimed at those who are not taxed in the United Kingdom.
According to the State Treasury calculations, this would amount to £120 million per annum, which would be used to support homeless people.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher fees for the properties purchased in the United Kingdom, and the surplus revenue from this will be used to support homeless people, and Theresa May will be announced at a press conference today.
The aim of the action is probably to counterbalance the success achieved by Jeremy Corby in young voters, which has been achieved by making it possible for more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in taxes will affect individuals and companies who do not tax in the United Kingdom, and the extra income from this will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional fee to be added to the current levy, which can be accounted for more than three percent of the real estate purchased two years ago and for the purpose of spending.
The State Treasury is estimated at GBP 120 million per year following the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by citizens outside the United Kingdom, leading to a significant price increase resulting in an increasingly difficult situation for first-house buyers.
Many of the rich districts of the country have become “spiritual city, ” especially in the capital, since many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill arrived just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the fees that could help young people who were preparing for their first home.
According to him, large companies in the construction industry are responsible for the high maintenance of real estate prices, which have become a practice to purchase and leave the areas. May was asked to delete the quotas for affordable houses and to start something with the \"market shame\" in the country.
A number of noticeable proposals have been presented for Corbyn housing reforms, including rent control and the removal of well-informed migrants.
It would also give the Council more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Tavaly said that I wanted to devote my Prime Minister to restoring the English dream and to making life better for every generation.
For this, the situation on the real estate market needs to be settled.
Britain continues, as always, to be open to those who want to live here, work and start a family.
However, it is not right for individuals outside the country to buy real estate just as easily as those who work hard in England.
Dreams of their own home became almost impossible for too many people, while homelessness became too accessible,
Jack Ross: “I have a major desire to become the manager of the Scottish team, ” he says.
Jack Ross, according to the Sunderland coach, “the greatest desire, ” is to be the manager of the Scottish National Team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to face the challenges of raising the North East Club, which is currently in the third place of the first-class league, with only three remaining points from the first position.
He then transferred his seat to the stadium that was crossed into the Stadium of Light after he successfully returned his team of St. Mirren to the first-class Scottish football competition in the previous season.
\"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
Sadly, however, I was only able to get into the reserve – Ross said on the program BBC Sportsound.
– When I was a kid, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled back at them.
Now, however, all I have is a chance to succeed as a club manager,
There's Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio in the Sunderland Manager's predecessor.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic does not care that such great names must be printed and has previously rejected the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"I'm measuring the success at this moment as to whether I can get the team back to first class.
If we take out the structure and facilities of the club, it is definitely the place in the first-class league – he said.
– It's not going to be easy to get back, but more than likely, that I'm only going to see my activities here as a success if we can get the club back.
Ross's management career started just three years ago after working as an alternate coach for Dumbarton and spending 15 months at the Hearts Coach.
Then Aolla was helped to stand by after the team fell back to the third class, and St. Mirren, standing on the edge of the fall, took the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross claims he feels more confident now than ever during his gambling career, like Clyde, either Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic team.
“It was a very decisive moment, ” he quoted the period of training Allo.
– I clearly thought that management was more for me than to be a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done well, and I've had a very good life of it, and I've had some really memorable moments.
However, the lives of players are sometimes very hard.
A lot of things have to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the job, but the management tasks lie to me.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, when I'm an adult, I'm feeling the best in my skin right now.
The entire interview is broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel by local time from 12:00 to 13:00 on Sunday Sundays September 30.
According to a study Saturday afternoon at 5:30 p.m., beer falls best
In the summer heat wave there has been a significant increase in the traffic of difficult English pubs, but pressure on the chain is still very severe.
On the basis of the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the number of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant company that produces statistics, said: “As a result of the solar period and the expected longer World Championship in England, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when the pubs experienced an increase of 2.8%, with the difference that even a further decline in restaurants could be observed.
In July, the decline of 1.8% in restaurants deteriorated.
The pubs and bars selling mainly alcohol were the best performers who even raised more than the fall in restaurants.
The pubs offering more food were also uncomfortable affected by the lasting sun, although not nearly as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
It seems people prefer drinking at a time like this.
The revenue from the drinks of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the income from food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, a leisure and catering RSM analyst says: “These results follow the trend that has been drawing up since the end of April.
The weather and major Community and sports events are still the main revenue factor for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the chain of restaurants is in a difficult situation and that the annual drop in revenue of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressure.
It could not have been worse for long, hot summer restaurants for operators, and it will only be time to see whether the more moderate weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area.
The total increase in revenue from pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, excluding newly opened places, which reflects the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which collects and analyses performance data from a group of 47 members of the UK catering industry (bubbs, bars and restaurants) as a widely accepted industrial factor.

Eilith Doyle will be the voice of the “sporters, ” in the Scottish Athletic Association
Elith Doyle was elected as non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle Scotland's most effective athlete, and Ian Beattie, president of the Board, says that sports decision-makers will be an inestimable contribution to its extensive international experience over the past decade.

Thank you very much for the encouraging message -
Breastbath advertising that compares mothers to cows shares the online community
Heves debated online by a company producing breast-feeding, which compared breastfeeding mothers to the head cells.
According to Elvie, he developed “the world’s first silent, portable mammalian, ” and the appearance of their product was advertised in a musical video, ironic advertising, which showed the freedom of giving to milk - ending mothers.
Four real mothers danced in a cowhouse full of apples, while the following lines of song can be heard in the background: “Yes, I have to say, I have no heads, I have no dick, and if I hadn’t noticed, these aren’t girls, but my breasts ”
And the refren sounds like: “I’m pumping, pumping, the baby eats big, pumping, pumping, making the chicks look like a big one, ”
The advertising published on the Facebook page quickly crosses online disputes.
The video has reached 77 000 views, and there are hundreds of comments showing mixed acceptance. Many say that advertising is a fire from the milk industry’s winery.
“A product is advertised with highly tasteless cows.
Like us, their bodies only produce milk if they produce life, but their wines are taken from them within days, ” recalls one speaker.
Elvie breast-feeding is available in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother animal and the calf.
But why not use them to sell a nipple to mothers who can keep their children “
Someone else added: “Ad that is completely insensitive, ” he said.
Others came to the defense of advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was fun.
\"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have taken it as soon as I was breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I won't try to see it again.
The product is brilliant – it has been written.
Another comment says: “This is a funny ad for mothers making milk in their workplace or in a toilet who feel like “cheese”.
It does not praise or condemn the milk industry –
At the end of the video, women show that the discrete nipple was in their bra while dancing.
The campaign is building on the feeling that women who use breast milk sometimes feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump does not use wires and pipes, however, can be discretely placed in a breast-feeding bra so that women can move freely, keep their children in their hands or even move out during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communication director of Mother, says: “The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
We wanted to draw attention to the challenges of the use of nipples and the funny sense of the sense of freedom that our mammalian has given us in relation to this –
Elvie's nipple wasn't first on the news.
On London's Fashion Week, a mother of two children went out in Marta Jakubowski's clothing while using the product.
Hundreds of young migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of child-age migrants in custody has been restored, while the number of monthly crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the difficulty to find homes that have been taken in due to the harsh rhetoric of Trump administration and its measures to date.
Beneficiaries are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they are afraid that they would make their chances of staying in the country if they appeared to receive children.
This threat was further increased in June when it was announced that parents and adults living with them should give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, head of Immigrant and Customs Environment (Bemigian and Customs Office), acknowledged in his statement before Congress last week that dozens of people were arrested for receiving minors who arrived without escorts.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were unpunished.
\"80% of those who apply to the host and who live with them are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are convicted of a criminal offence.
That is why we continue to search for such individuals, ” said Albence.
In order to speed up the proceedings concerning children, new rules have been introduced, according to which a part of them must appear before the court within one month of being taken into custody, instead of 60 days before the court, the social workers claim.
Many people apply to court through videoconferences instead of personal appearances to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge doesn't give you legal protection, the immigrant is quickly expelled.
Over the past few months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer detention, the more nervous and depressed children will be, and the chances of violent break-outs or escape attempts have increased.
According to lawyers, these risks are only increased by a larger facility similar to that of the gymnastics, where children are more difficult to withstand those who need psychological care because of their number.
They added that if they don't give children enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends before they're transferred to an establishment like this, they'll be put into even more trauma.
Syria immediately called on the American, French and Turkish “serious forces ” to leave
In spite of the civil war of the eighth year in the country, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke before the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
Moualem, who also held the Deputy Prime Minister's position, claimed that foreign troops have entered the Syrian area illegally, referring to the fight against terrorism, and will also be treated as such.
“They must withdraw without any condition, ” said the Assembly.
Mountain proved that “the war against terrorism will soon end, ” in Syria, where over 360 000 have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He stated that Damascus would engage in a holy fight to clear the entire territory of Syria, from terrorist groups and from the illegal foreign presence.
The U.S.'s 2000 soldiers are in Syria, most of them are trained and advised by the Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting the Bassar.
France has sent more than 1,000 soldiers into the affected country of war.
In relation to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were right for their return and that only “some Western countries ” would stimulate the“irral fears ”, preventing refugees from returning home.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the population return, ” he said.
– They made a policy out of a purely humanitarian question –
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement was reached between Assed and its opposition to the end of the war.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey establishing a conflict zone around Idlib, the last great flood of the rebels, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from attacking a wide range of three million people.
However, he pointed out that the agreement set out “clear deadlines ” and indicated that military action would only be directed against the jihadists, including the Al-Kaida Front, which should be ‘researched’.
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that we will soon be able to call together a committee composed of delegates from the government and the opposition, whose task is to prepare the post-war syr constitution and prepare the elections.
Moulem considers that the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, such as the revision of certain articles of the current Constitution, is acceptable and that he is protecting all external actors from interference with the process.
That's why they're gonna re-select Trumpot
Following this logic, Trumpot will certainly be re-electiond in 2020, unless there are many liberal viewers' hopes that will come true, and a liability procedure or a scandal will not end his presidency before the time of the scandal.
We can be sure that this would be “the most amazing presidential finale of all time...
But for now, viewers are enjoying the show.
Since 2014, the main time views of CNN increased to 1.05 million, and MSNBC almost tripled its views to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers over the four years ago, instead of 1.7 million on MSNBC, and the Rachel Maddow Show is the most beautiful cable show with its 3.5 million audience, which will be on the night of the most significant news.
“It attracts us like fire because something we did not understand, ” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series of the ABC-A appointed survivor. In this series, a low-ranking ministar of the cabinet sits in the presidential chair after the death of Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a veteran of the “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaing Into the Hollywood Boys” Club author.
In this way, he calls out a Boston taxi road before the 2016 election:
The driver told me Trumpra was gonna vote.
\"Why,\" he asked Scovell.
\"Because he made me laugh,\" said the driver.
This is the amusing force of chaos.
Of course, contrary to television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs Wade-precedents to reunite immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can make sure you don't care about these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information, when we have been staring at a debate show in which the anonymic background discussions used in Bob Woodward's book \"Feel\" are being held, or Paul Manafort's 15 thousand-dollar-dollar structure skin jacket (the body's arrogance - according to the wording of The Washington Post) or the consequences of his description of Stormy Daniels Trump, ehm, an anatomy.
What was right for me is gonna make me think of Super Mario all the time.
“There is a little feeling that a reality show is being watched, where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, creator of the Star stars. In Trump’s show, the actors are always changing, and new turns are coming every day (for example, N.F.L., begins to praise Kim Jsongun).
If you miss one part, you miss one part.
When I got here this week, Fleiss, a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny time was Kaain, but he was still in his house staring at MSNBC, recording CNN's show.
He couldn't break from the TV as Brett Kavanaugh began his hearing at the Senate Justice Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was the bet.
“I remember when we were making those crazy shows, many said that this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization, ” Fleiss recalled.
- I thought they were joking, but they seem to have been right,

Both parties pour money into the most frequent competitions of the semi-time congressional election
No one was surprised to find that in the 17th constituencies of Pennsylvania both parties are uncounted after the rescaling of the convention districts, two active representatives are fighting for the same chair.
One of the poems for the newly redesigned district of Pitsburg is the Democratic Conor Lamb, who obtained mandates in an interim election last spring.
The Republican Keith Rothfus is currently a representative of the previous 12 constituencies of Pennsylvania, which represents a significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map had to be redefined after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found in January that the former frontiers were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties’ funding bodies, the Democratic Campbell Congressional Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC) have been almost interdependent during the campaign.
Lamb's name was known in Pennsylvania after winning a close competition for the March interim election in the Congress district of Pennsylvania 18.
For over a decade, the House of Representatives has been the Republicans, Donald Trump has won the district with 20 exact benefits.
The political experts say that the Democrats have a better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador in support of China and then withdrawn from the plan
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington barely responded to.
Donald Trump discussed in a good mood in June 2017 with Juan Carlos Varela's president, and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners excluded the Trump Organisation's leadership team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called back the U.S. headquarters from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to their ‘likely decided not to support Taiwan’s earlier announcement of Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received approximately USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painfully affected the Central American country, where the unemployment and killing rates were also very high.
As closed meetings continued, the North and Central American competent authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have continued a similar meeting last year, with the primary objective of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of administration made it clear that I would like to hold a conference, which clearly indicated that they would not want to punish El Salvador.
At the conference planned in mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence also spoke, which, according to the diplomats, is a clear indication of the importance of administration.
The three Americans quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue statements of condemnation or criminal measures.
John Bolton's white house speaker refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported by the three American officials, including two diplomats anonymously.
Their reporters were also supported by external analysts close to the administration, who also agreed to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next blow could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who's investigating if Trump's in some way blocked the justice system.
Mueller's investigation is also reported to include if Trump's team cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are put in a majority in Congress, they must try to take Trumpot into charge, who, after the voters, may have to face up to the judgment of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain issues, and Trump's fall is far from inevitable... as it is not a European principle.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how far the fight will go.
In 1938 a number of German officers were ready to kiss Hitler, but they were waiting for the West to stand next to the Czech Slovaks in Munich.
The aid has not been granted, so it has not been possible to prevent bloodshed in the next few years.
It is at such historical turnouts that the inevitable development of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Today in America, we can identify several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump replaced the Deputy State Prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, investigating Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been invading since last year, when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested to record discussions with the president and stated that Trump had an inappropriate office.
Rosenstein said the Times reported the events impracticably.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is biased or not complete, and despite a well-established sexual harassment charge, will it be appointed to the Member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is: are we voting in the interim elections for a Congress that stands ready to take on Trumpot?
If we fail these trials, democracy will be ahead of us for a long winter.
I trust that it will not, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that was once incorporated in my embassy building.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light candles on a table bearing the sign of the artillery during Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be a plague for our future?

Graham Dorrans, playing in the Rangers before the Rapid Vienna game
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. The Austrian victory against the Spanish Villarreal can ensure that they participate in the Group of Europe-liga G after the unannounced tie.
Because of Graham Dorrans' knee injury, he couldn't go to the game against Villarreal in the season, but he feels that building this result, the Rangers could set more ambitious goals for himself.
“There was a great team against Villarreal – said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we were able to get a point and we brought a point.
Maybe we could've pulled one more goal at the end, but we can't complain about the tie.
They were better in the first half, and we were connected in the second half.
It's gonna be another important European game on Thursday.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good at the last game, but with our fans behind our backs, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was hard enough, I got hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now it's very optimistic.
It's a good team, guys enjoy the game, workouts are good.
I hope that if we put everything in it, we can leave the previous season behind, and we can achieve good results.
Many women are concerned that they don't care enough for their old age.
The surveyers had an accurate idea of what age they wanted, but only a small part of them talked to their family members about it.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their old-age care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said she was talking to her children about it.
“ Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t get involved, ” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
It's worth doing the following.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to take care of you properly if you do not tell them in time what your needs are.
They choose together with their adviser and family about where and what kind of care they want; these decisions have a significant impact on later costs.
Take in a financial advisor: he gives useful ideas about how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can take place with a traditional insurance policy designed for old-age care or a hybrid life insurance combined with savings that can cover the costs or use your own assets as cover... if you have enough resources to add.
Prepare the legal documentation: The possibility of future trading will be cut in advance.
Trust a representative, a trusted person who acts on your behalf on health matters, supervises his medical care and ensures that everything is done according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with financial management.
This trusted person will make the necessary financial decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid when you are unable to do so.
Don't forget about the little details: Let's say that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about your medicine and your allergies?
Please record these data in writing so that they can be made available at any time.
“It is not just financial questions that need to be clarified, but also who your doctor has added Martin.

It is necessary to plan everything in advance –

Earthquakes and escaper in Indonesia
They lost at least 384 their lives on Fridays when an earthquake of great power and then a fugitive hit the city of Palu in Indonesia. According to the authorities, the number of victims could increase further.
The communication network in the area has also been damaged, so there has been no news of the government of Donggala, north of Palu, where it has been the centre of the 7.5 - strong earthquake.
More than 16,000 people in Palu had to be evacuated.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
The capital city of Palu Central Celebes, on the west coast of Celebes Island, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its creation when the earthquake and the fugitive were struck.
The governorship of Donggala is located over 300 km long on the north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
The government was around 299 200 in 2017.
Central Celebes are mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
nickel mining is one of the important sectors of the economy, but mainly in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Katastrophaelist Agency, Palut and Donggala have many times been hit by a fugitive in the last 100 years.
A 1938 fugitive killed more than 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, West Donggala reached a fountain and then died nine.
Indonesia is located in the area of the geographically active Pacific Fire ring and therefore there are frequent earthquakes.
Only a few of the larger earthquakes and fountains of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a huge sea quake began at the west coast of the province of Aceh, which started a fountain of 14 countries, requiring a total of 226 000 lives along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of the victims lost their lives in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong vibrations hit the west coast of Sudan between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died near Nias Island near Sumatra.

In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov killed eight of his victims, and that he was “manded to cause injury, standing in the prosecution office of the southern district of New York.
According to the file submitted, proof of any of the two charges could justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of 22 crimes, including eight-time blackmail killings, which were nearly exclusively used to combat organized crime and the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
According to the attacks, the attack required considerable planning and premeditative intent, the prosecutors claim that he did it “in a flexible, cruel, inhumane way. ”
“Sayfullo Habibulavic Saipov caused pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and the family of Aleksandro Damian Pagnucco.

Saipov's defenders asked the prosecutors earlier not to press for a death penalty.

Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton is closer to the world champion after receiving the victory before Sebastian Vettel, thanks to the team tours.
After qualifying for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday Valtteri Bottas, it became clear immediately that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play a big role in my race.
Bottas, starting from no position, started well and almost got Hamilton in trouble because he protected his position in the first two circles, which enabled Vettel to attack his teammate.
First Vet went to the boxing room and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the middle field, which should have proved to be decisive.
Mercedes stood out a round later, and he came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a close operation, during which the Ferrari’s pilot left free of the inner curve after moving twice as a defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the rear row of the radial cubes, and by the end of the first round, it was the seventh.
Then it led a large part of the race, because it didn't change the tires so that he could quickly target and beat Kimi Räikkönen down in the hope of a fourth place.
Finally, he was on the 44th round in the box, but he couldn't increase his pace in the remaining eight circles, so Räikkönen became the fourth place.
“It was day four because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let go.
The team made it an exceptional effort to get the first two places, said Hamilton.
His body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting, because the senator insisted that she didn't leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter, charged with sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
At the meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony of Ford, which he did before the Senate Committee on Justice, but only noted, the events in the Senate prove that people are “sacrific, detestable, and liars ”
“What can happen, and that wonderful thing that happened in the past few days in the Senate, when they see anger when they see people as angry, demented, hated, and liars, ” he said.
“If we look at the statements and leaks, they say, “O, well, that wasn’t me.
That was not me.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? – oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.”
Well, let's just hold it for a second.
We leaked?... No, we didn’t leak... he added, following the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked out at the beginning of September. Feinstein, however, denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s statements, and I did not leak his story, ” Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill’s report.
“I have been asked to deal with it in confidence and to deal with it in a confidential manner, ” he asked me.
However, it seems that his refusal was not accepted by the president who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I’m telling you what the situation is: he had a very bad speech.
It may not have leaked out, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the member of the Supreme Court who was accused of sexual harassment by three women that the Democrats were using alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take whatever means they can, but they are able to regain power.
You can see vanity, hatred, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run to gain power and control, ” quoted Mediate.

New York Dad sued a party after a \"rasist\" message
A New York Dajka brought an action against a couple of discriminating dismissals, after a mistake in a message sent to him, the mother complained that “they have now been able to use another black bean. ”

‘NEEEEEEEEEM, MÁGINT IS FAILED,’ wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
But instead of your husband, you sent your message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after he woke up to his crime, Plasco-Flaxman, who was “unbelievingly sensitive, let go of Ms. Maurice, claiming that the leaving nanny who was afro-American had done a bad job and rather counted for a philip.
Ms. Maurice was paid one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation because of his dismissal and asks for 350 bucks a day for inside work for the six-month period, for which he was originally hired, even without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop going, that can’t be done,” said the Post on Friday, adding: “I know that this is discrimination ”

It's not racist.
We are not racist, ” said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone with whom, even if by chance, was he rude?
Your newborn?

Questionable future of Brett Kavanaugh, as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could achieve what he requested – a limited-time, limited-scale investigation – perhaps we could agree – Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was holding the party’s decision-making capacity from the commission’s “death ”.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and Republican supporters oppose the FBI's investigation?
Their opposition can only be attributed to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are not well, it will be much harder for them to get their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and also met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI announces his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republican and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable the vice-president, Mike Pence, to decide to bring Mr Kavanaugh in to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean dissidents (decreased) under Kim's command
The number of North Korea dissidents in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jongun took over seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Bjengszok quoted data from the Ministry of Southern merger and said that the last year there was 1127 dissidents against 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said that the increased border guards between North Korea and China and the higher penalties imposed on smugglers were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not publicly comment on this information.
The majority of the northern dissidents eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have entered the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most people are running towards China, which has the longest border for North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between Korea.
The dissidents are treated as an illegal immigrant in China and are not accepted as refugees and are often sent back by force.
In practice, the relationship between North and South still in war has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leader of the two countries met in Phenjan, the focus of their discussion was on stuck nuclear disposal negotiations.
This happened with the historic meeting in June between Donald Trump and President of the United States of America and Kim Jongun in Singapore, where a large number of lines agreed on further cooperation with the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Jongho, blamed the US for the lack of advance.
“In the absence of confidence in the Americans, trust in our national security is no longer a source of trust, and in such circumstances it is impossible to imagine that we unilaterally take down our weapons, ” Ri said in the United Nations High Assembly in New York.

Kavanaugh protested against rumors that he was sexually harassed by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in their teenage years.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he was screaming and his voice fell apart when he spoke about his family and his high school years.
In addition, he specifically condemned the Committee's Democrats, including the charges against him as \"grotisk and coordinated character killings\", which resulted in the defeat of the Hillary Clinton in 2016 presidential election by angry liberals.
Pelosi said that he felt that Kavanaugh’s conduct proved that he was not fit for work at the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he excluded himself from his statements and his conduct against the Clintons and the Democrats, ” he said.
Pelosi was foamed when they asked if he would try to take responsibility for Kavanaugh, in case it fills the post, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House.
“I’m just saying that if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, but not for the court where it is right now, ” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the capital appeal court.
Pelosi added that he was concerned, as a democrat, about the possible decisions of Kavanugh regarding the Law on Remuneration or Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh’s hearings, he avoided questions about whether or not he would copy decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There’s no time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court and expect us to get rid of the joy, ” Pelos said.
And women have to keep it under control.
This is a legitimate rush, months and years of anger that has come to an end, and he can't give up without crying.
“ We cry when we’re angry, ” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's that rare, but...
“I had a great help with a woman who worked somewhere in the leadership position,” she told me that she was crying in anger, but she developed a technique that, according to her crying in anger, said to her conversation partner: “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I'm angry.”
And then he kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea.
Partly, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they were fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vibrant memories of an early job, an office dominated by men, where I started crying in my inability to cry, that I had a woman over my neck – a cool manager, whom I always feared – and he took me to the stairwell.
“Let them cry, ” he told me.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy because they've been upset,
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an out-of-martial affair on the land called Monroe Business, he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he realized there was no reason why he couldn't go for the presidency himself.
“ There was no sound decision, ” he said 30 years later, laughing at me.
\"There have been seven other candidates in the competition, and the new candidate has been wanted to be in the middle of their backs.
Someone called it “Sun Whites and the Smurfs of the Week, ”
Since the campaign has been held for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the fund-raiser, he has accepted that he will not go into competition unless he takes $2 million together.
It was a battle to lose.
He found out some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“They thought I would get a discount, ” he reasoned.
When he held a press conference not to launch an official campaign, the emotions were so overtaken because of the people he supports, and because of the frustrations and the anger of sexism that caused the money to be collected and directly to the voters.
“It was believed that I had a nervous breakdown, ” quoted Ms. Schroeder, how the press responded to it.
\"They wanted my corporate sponsor to be Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were gonna write on my gravestone?
“Daughter” means:
How can the US China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening war on trade between the US and China was almost an earring, and the battle was not yet over, according to the experts, the break between countries could favour Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the president of the US, fired first warnings at the beginning of the year, putting taxes on the most important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant breakdown took place this week, as the new duties already affect a product worth $ 200 billion, practically taxing half of the Chinese goods to the US.
In any case, Beijing has reduced duty, last time between five and ten percent, to an American product worth USD 60 billion.
China accepted that it would recover every time, and the second largest economy in the world would certainly not back down in the near future.
If you wanted to get Washington to back down, it would mean you have to give it up in front of the demands, but public bending towards the US would be too embarrassing for Hszi Chin-ping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is well-tacted, the US's trade war pressure could be good for China in the long term, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision can be made in Washington or Beijing to create conditions that could put any economic vortex on the economy of the two countries far more serious than what the observers previously recognised, ” said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia at the New American Security.
Syria is ready to return to the refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that he is ready to return to the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed in over seven years of war.
In his speech before the United Nations Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valad Moallem claimed that the state's conditions are improving.
\"The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government will continue to reinvigorate areas destroyed by terrorists and restore normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to flee between terrorism and the economic measures that had taken on their own, which affected their daily lives and their lives.
According to UN calculations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
More than six million people living in the country need humanitarian help.
Moallem told me that the Syrian state would be happy to re-establish the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or cooperation from countries that supported the rise.
Europe acquired Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the U.S. team 16,5:10,5 on Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has now fallen in the European scene for the sixth time and has not won Ryder since 1993 in Europe.
Europe protected its championship title as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player struggling on the entire tournament, has put his punch in the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving the victory to Mr Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was glowing all over, so he became one of the 4 players who had ever achieved the 5-0-0 since the tournament started in 1979 as it is today.
The American Jordan Spieth received 5&4 from the lowest-ranking player of the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
The best players in the world are Dustin Johnson, who lost 2&1 against Ian Populter, who may have been involved in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of all time in the tournament with a career point of 25,5.
“I’m not crying in her face, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough one year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for having chosen and believed in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy I got the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I am happy to be able to help you, ” said Garcia, who is struggling with emotions, after winning Europe.
He's going to give the Battebot to Jon Rahm, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday, 2&1.
“I feel incredibly proud to defeat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man, ” he said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now has a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 titles and only received Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played excellent golf during the entire tournament.
After the disappointing result of the US team captain Jim Furyk’s team, he said: “Happy to these guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Down with the hat in front of Thomas.
It's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love this 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You're gonna have to raise your hats.
The opponent was better at our house.
