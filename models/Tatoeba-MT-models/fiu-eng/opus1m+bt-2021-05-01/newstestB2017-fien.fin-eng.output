28-year-old cook was found dead in a Sanfranciscola shopping center
Just recently moved to San Francisco, a 28-year-old cook was found dead at the local mall stairs this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body we found on Wednesday morning at Westfield Shopping Center was identified as the 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reported by the San Francisco Medical Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the TV company ABC's KGO station in San Francisco that Frank previously worked as a cook in Boston had found his dream job leaving San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant as a chef six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
We're a small and close team, like a family.
Our idea is with Frank's family and his friends.
Louis Galicia tells me that Frank was living at the hostels first, but he had finally got his business in order.
He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend, and he told Louis Galicia at the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to put food to us all,\" Louis Galicia says.
He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the power.
In spite of all the wrongs in the world, he was a sandless diamond that shined every day, he says.
All knowledge is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department's reference number 415-575-4444.
New work struggles are required by law enforcement doctors
The representatives of British junior doctors (who are primarily specialised in Finland) have signed up to their trade union and have requested permission to engage in new work struggles in a dispute on a new employment contract.
The JDC, a member of the British Trade Union (BMA), is requesting support from its entire government for further work fighting since the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, ministers have not solved any problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in their vote in July.
58% of the members participating in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the chairman of the Junior Medicine Committee, Ellen McCourt, published a letter to JDC members, saying that the government has been self-consumptioned, which McCourt says led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter says: \"In view of this, the JDC Government has fully rejected the new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations to be held on all our concerns.
In response to the government's difficulty, the JDC Government has today submitted an official request to the BMA Government asking for the least advanced work struggles since early September.
It is because of the dispute that junior doctors have been on strike for six times this year, which included the first complete job stand-outs ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of BMA's junior doctor, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms recommended by BMA.
Ms Malawana said to the members of the BMA that the agreement was good and should be accepted and 54 000 junior doctors and medical students took part in the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will enter into force and apply to doctors from England.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was an gesture that decided the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday in exchange for reconciliation and to finalise the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin was taking his Turkish brothers against Peter’s palace in the golden hall, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire to reconcile.
The parties, of course, served,
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't even heat up with his own kind of restraint.
On the other hand, Recep Tayip Erdogan repeatedly spoke about his good friend, Mr Putin, five times, according to a report.
I couldn't stay on the bill myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But Putin, a constant hoarse, showed that the Russian headman has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down the Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the event was furious.
Putin attacked tightly, I said against Ankara, and accused him of stabbing the back.
The insult was even bigger than that because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting true trust back will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
Over the months, the most controlled media in the state visited a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious accusations of top officials were that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trafficking in Isis in areas controlled by Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only organised so that Putin received his request for forgiveness from President Erdogan.
This allowed Russia to win some kind of profit.
The benefits of proclamation of weapons to Ankara are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost out of power in a failed coup last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
The agreement also has an economic impact.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter flight ban, because normally every year millions of Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast.
The number has collapsed by nearly 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take care of the relief when air transport can eventually be continued.
They're putting their faith in a late-sun-sevent rush to the Mediterranean.
And yet this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall, while Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.
You put the tomatoes back in there, you put the household paper in the Vedemos article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the west because it thinks that the West is responding to a coup d'état.
Without forgetting the old grudge about Turkey's EU membership negotiations and Putin's involvement in matters, a putin that is eager to use the cool spaces and undermine Turkey's ties to the west.
No doubt the Russian leader won the bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup.
This was self-evident for Moscow, who has suffered his own pain in changing power.
Therefore, Russia and Turkey, at their peak meeting, could convey a picture of what an analyst described as a non-governmental alliance: two countries that experienced being rejected by the West and subjectively.
Despite the public reconciliation, these two still have great differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
To tell you a lot, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, each president said at a press conference that they had not dealt with the issue at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of national differences, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek a consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete disaster caused by Turkey, the NATO Member State, when shooting down a Russian war machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are once again on the table.
Royal Bank of Scotland is missing from its customers outside Scotland
According to the Director General of RBS, the bank’s activities outside Scotland are reduced so that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the bank's global objectives.
The bank had to back down on its goals, almost to the end, eight years ago, and it had to be saved.
During that period, Brandistratists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of weights of international sports, including Six Nations Rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now we have seen it as the right thing to do in the first place to release more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain for Scottish customers, but it will not be used as a discount for RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff at Inverness Shehir.
He said to the BBC Scotland: “RBS will become an investment brand and because of the fact that we are now turning into a bank of different brands.
Since the bank itself became a worldwide brand, RBS also became a worldwide brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby, and it has increased the profile of different brands in sponsoring sport.
“It is now time to move to a bank with different brands, ” says the President of the Bank.
It would have been very difficult three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brandes.
But our work and focus on customer needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right...
Frankie Dettor rode Predilection to victory in Newmarket and won 3,000.
Dettor showers champagne twice after winning in a row in Newmarket, which meant a 3 000th victory for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettor confirmed his 3 000 winnings in the British Championship in Newmarket Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night on the track of his own municipality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettor, 45, is the sixth jockey that achieves this philanthropic race on a flat track.
He's been through the same thing before, Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time master jockey Dettor, who previously won at Ghayyar, says, \"This is special.
My feelings are on the ground because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big one, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-person audience.
I'm relieved and I feel great humility.
Dettor accepts cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone competition, and they're champion Richard Johnson and retired 20 times by master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won his record career more than 4 300 times.
Lester Piggott, 9 times Derby winner, 4 493 wins
\"Frankie is one of the best jockeys this time, and it is no surprise that she has just reached this milestone, to which few have come.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical advantage is what separates him from the rest of the world.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm, and the charisma have brought to the species supporters for years.
- I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won already 6,000 competitions if he hadn't competed only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career in the UK has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He's a lively person who's good for British competition, but above all, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor poured out his achievement in a familiar way by flying down his horse’s back.
The example of British competition has been two decades ago from flying goal results to flying landings.
There's been some ups and downs.
He has won a number of major races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 – Magnificent Seven, but he has also survived a flight accident and has been in competition because of the abuse of medicines.
When the competition ban ended three years ago, he had difficulties in starting up, but he showed a remarkable strength of character, seemed to his suspects and returned to his best of all.
And he's not going to be out of his career for a while – Dettor has recently said he wants to continue his competition until he's 50 years old.
Putin was separated by Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly resigned his Head of Administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's believed inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the Kremlin announcement, President Putin decided to release Ivanov as head of the Russian presidential administration, but no grounds for dismissal were reported.
Anton Vayo, acting as Ivanov Deputy Head of Mission since 2012, was appointed.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
The Vamo, born in 1972 in Tallinn, graduated from the Moscow Institute of National Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President's protocol department and the Government's office, reports the Russian-speaking website of Kreml.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment: “I am grateful for your confidence.
I believe that the most important task of administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making draft laws and controlling the way in which the instructions you give are implemented.
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended Vao to be his successor.
Are there genuine smiles?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been in the vicinity of Vladimir Putin, and, like Putin, he has KGB-manship.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the Russian state TV show, both said Ivanov's withdrawal from duty on his own request.
Despite the smiles shown on the cameras, only a few are convinced, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are you fired from some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been praised as President would suddenly want to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kreml website presents the words of Ivanov to Putin, saying: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complex and somewhat difficult task for four years.
Now I've been President's Head of Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
When Putin served as head of KGB's replacement security service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff.
When Putin entered power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At times it was thought that Ivanov might become Russian President Putin after the second period, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another area near Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister, and then he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI Researchers Star Thomas Gibson got fired after hitting the producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios that produce the series reported a kick in their joint communications.
As Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, known as the series, had filed an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was notified.
- We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened, he says when he's been informed.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents, published later, will be reported in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously, Dharma & Greg played in a comedy series of 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in a series of its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul on it for the last twelve years, ” says Gibson on Friday’s release release.
I was hoping to see you all the way to the end of the series, but that's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group and most importantly: the best fans that the series could have hoped for.
The 12th production season of the series begins in the United States on the 28th of September.
The mysterious beaching of fish in the Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help to identify fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain has doubts about these 75-fished windmills that have been caught in the land as an image of a whirlpool.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the seashore, published a visual material in Periscope and hoped to have an answer to the appearance of these five-centred fish.
The Queensferry crossing is now connected to Fifee
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected Queensferry's crossing bridge to the north deck and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fifee.
It is the first of the four sections between the cover straps, which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 silicon-coppers.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister of Economy, visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing bridge.
We are all witnessing an important step forward in the construction of the bridge. Only more than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge.
Despite massive size and weight, building a bridge between the bridge and bridge is a delicate operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The whole bridge is now almost 79%, and the rest of the deck is about to get its concrete pain in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be raised.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, says: “The completion of the first bridge section is always an important urinacity in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the peak in the road and water construction sectors.
After the last part of the road was installed and connected to the North Tower roadside, then we had to close the remaining north side (i.e. the underground) gap.
This was done by drawing 700 millimeter south from the northern coast.
This was a massive and at the same time a major mission requiring accuracy.
Massive, because the earth has a length of 222 metres and a weight of about 6 000 tonnes, it was to be drawn up at an angle of approximately 3%.
And with great precision, because the tolerances that the labor team had to follow were very small – only a few millimetres.
I'm glad everything went well.
The rescue facility at Moelfre Bay tells of three men’s wonders
At Anglesey, three men who had taken water from their fishing vessels were saved like a miracle store.
Moelfre RNLI’s Marine Rescue Station alarmed at 13.20 local time in its crew’s observed accident in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boats continued their reckless journey without a pilot.
\"We saw the boat circle right next to them, and we imagined the worst,\" says Vince Jones driving the Moelfre rescue boat.
I'm glad that by that time we got to the water, the strong winds had moved the boat away from them.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third one, from the age of 60, was found exhausted by a boy and no life jackets.
All of them were taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says: \"It is a miracle that these three men who are in possession of water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The engine of the boat had an emergency fire alarm, but for some reason it had removed the boat from the man who had spent time in connection with the crash.
They were really lucky on their journey.
Pokémon Go hunting that health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside and stare at their squares.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and move.
Originally, the screen time took just a watch on TV, then video games came along with the last smartphone.
So it is amazing to note that technology and outdoors do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application with characters from video games created in the 1990s (which were later made in a series of drawings, playing cards and other products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped slightly before the new game started in July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
In other countries, Lanseration was delayed due to huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In a brief description, players will go out looking for Pokémons with their smartphone, which will be monitored using GPS. When you find the Pokémé, it can be-lighted (with the display image on the phone) or \"capitulate\"
The wildness has pushed a generation of video games younger and raised the backs on the couch.
In the United States, the game has made a significant increase in the number of steps the average person takes a day.
Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch watch Cardiogram application, which observed within two days of the game launch, that 30 minutes a day, the number of people moving suddenly rose from 45 to 53%. The cardiogram is followed by 35,000 users.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go for users, it only sees the raw data on the levels of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get up on the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have echoed into deaf ears because their campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have seemed unhappy.
However, the importance of sport should not be reduced.
Regularly moving probability of being infected with cancer or depression is lower.
Sports helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The fineness of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basics that support health – exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
Even new friends can be made possible during the hunt.
Like usual, this phenomenon includes disillusioners.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door when they're playing.
What about it?
There's been a breakthrough.
For even though smart phone applications like Fitz may have been able to monitor your activity earlier, they did not have reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
There will be a loss of novelty, and the use will decrease.
However, the success of Pokémons will result in more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the exercise and health of people leaving the hunt and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a series of women's artificial powers.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jump.
With the easy boom.
You're going to be all over the parlour with a permanate.
Great for everything.
And now also the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American Teliner won a multi-play championship on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic lights.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of a silver-based teammate named Aly Raisman and Russian Protestant Aliya Mustafina.
The US Simone Biles performs in the boom of women’s textile gymnastics in the individual competition final on Thursday, 2016 in the Rio Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The party became the fourth successive and the fifth American woman of all time, who won the championship of multiple matches, thus strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation or even the best of all time.
Bales burst into tears when his final total points came to light and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species to a completely new dimension and brings him to the same category with other superstars such as Michael Phelps:
She has won 15 World Championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with so ambitious and precise programs, that in 1984 the Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called her the greatest Teline Master of all time,
In Brazil, there was one last competition, which was first and foremost between Biles and his burden of personal expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring, less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
The US Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisma hug after winning gold and silver in the final of the unique competition of women in Rio's summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point of coordination on i over the country team and now retired to Martha Karoly's men.
While Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything before when he was on the top of a long time, it was not entirely true.
Part of his permanto programme – which includes a series of volts known as his card – is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard in the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
By now, when his grandparents were little adopted, and Coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a powerful figure. Boorman found a girl while he was at the day-care home in the gymnastic gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multi-play competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning pipe is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got in a small lead on two tours, it was like a fabrication.
There was a boom and a permanto left where Bales is a defensive world champion.
He got back to the leading position after getting 15.433 points from the boom and krooned the final result with his permamate yields at 15.933 points.
Raisman mildly hugged him while waiting for the final points, which was just a formality, and tears began to appear around the red, white and blue border color of the Bales when the dream he wrote once came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor revolution for four years ago when he first divided the third place, but then lost the Bronze to Mustafina in the re-round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, called the team by the Americans, was clearly in front of Mustafina.
He sent air kisses after his permanto programme and thus became the winner of the defeat position, which seemed uncertain at times.
As far as Bilesis is concerned, this big, 19-year-old stripe has a whole new meaning now:
Police report three music as victims of a serial killer in a car
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre for ten years, and the victims sat in the car talking and listened to music when they were shot, reports the police release on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on June 12, the daughter of Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis was shot in a car parked in the streets.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun, and then escaped by another car, says.
The police suspect that three deaths were probably not a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or 2 900 dollars found in the hall of another adult victim.
Reporter of Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether death is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two people have been wounded in the ninth attack, mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
“It is common for the events that they have occurred in residential areas in front of the homes, ” Howard told KPHO earlier this month by the television and radio company CBS’s subsidiary.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are linked to each other and that their author is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The witness told the police that the trinity had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police released a release stating that only half an hour before the death of the three-hourly pickup truck was empty. The shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Researchers found seals and took a bullet from the car seat and from the engine room, a bullet in the chipper.
The mother of a six-year-old boy with microcefal:
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and of course his mother.
However, unlike most elderly patients, Edmund has a microkephal or birth control due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuto's genetic disorder, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn't get through this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all – of course you are committed to it – he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them or perhaps survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that they invest children in institutional care.
My first reaction was that I didn't believe that there was any such practice anymore,\" says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a rollerifier.
Edmund got up to sit down and he didn't land until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowing down his own pace.
He walks with help and he rides his bike.
He's happy to play with his two brothers and he loves singing.
Elizabeth's going to present Edmund's invention of the sign that he means to me.
We teach him a sign language, Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it is not just a common sign language, but also a sign of Edmund’s own.
There may be a variety of diseases behind micro-cephalia: hereditarys such as Edmund, or pregnancy-time viral infections such as ashes or ziclavirus.
There is a wide variety of symptoms and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the life of those who are ill.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
-I keep working: what happens to us,
What we're gonna do...
And he still doesn't know.
- I haven't asked for a prophecy in a while, because I don't think anyone can give it to me.
But Picciuto has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the zicavirus.
Things are getting better.
Things are usually going to be fine.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared on Friday, due to emergency rainfalls and widespread floods. More rains are expected to be in the state on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers of South Louisiana and South Mississippi flooded and spread to a wide area as a result of severe hardships.
John Bel Edwards, Governor of Louisiana, reports that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already on the way to the flood areas.
Mike Steele, National Security and Emergency Governor, reports the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandfalls.
According to Steele, only tens of thousands of sandbags have been asked by the district of Tangifahoa.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturdays in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service notice, additional 76 to 27 mm can be found in the area.
South Alabama was given a flood warning on Friday when the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River Baton Rouge and near the Amite River Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to the weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the banks of the rivers may become flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that the flooding rivers are a threat in the Ascension County, as the flooding rivers slowly enter Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River on the southern side of the Mississippi state border in Louisiana Liverpool was already higher than ever on Friday at 9am.
The rescue work continued in the region of Amithe and Wilkinson in the southwest Mississip.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepdaughter were earlier on Friday near Gloria among those who were saved.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other half who lived nearby had warned him.
- We got up, and the water came up with a constant feed, says Hansford.
It went to my waist.
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years that she lived in the region.
Hansford says that he and his family have all the injuries, and he himself is the only one of them.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military trucks and taken them to the fire station of Gloria, where they had to protect on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly to a large extent when the hardships continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells us about the information received by an observer close to Livingston that almost 350 mm had rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil was wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities say that because of the flooding of heavy rainfalls and streets, the inhabitants of the Tangihohoa county had to be saved from their homes and that the school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangivahto had told the TV and radio company CBS’s subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
The district leader, Robby Miller, reports that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pet animals who had become prisoners of flood.
They've opened shelters for evacuated people in the cities of Amiten and Hammond.
They'll be able to return to their homes when the water starts to retreat, he says.
In the city of Hammond, nearly twenty streets were shut down because of flood, and the inhabitants were offered sand jackets in which they could try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
\"For the last time, we experienced a great flood in March,\" says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city government.
This flood looks like it.
In Mississip, the rain continued flat on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, reports the rescue director of Harrison County, Rupert Lacy.
Lacy says that on Thursday, there was reports of a deer flooded house, but on Friday there had so far not been any information.
Shopper Value Foods Sales Manager Keith Townson tells us that he has lived in Amitie Region for 40 years.
I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and more and more water all the time,
Several bullets on her body, six-year-old Mahaj Brown, will survive the Philadelphia shooting incident.
According to the police, there's been a six-year-old boy in Philadelphia who's already been shot in town by another six-year-old this week.
The grandparents of the child told me on CBS Philadelphia the boy was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said he had multiple gunshot wounds in his neck, legs, arms and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets, said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical state in the hospital, and he has been undergoing multiple surgery.
The family's telling the television company that the boy is believed to be able to survive.
He was about to start his first class at the local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
The target of the shooting was two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Another 29-year-old farm was reported to be critical and two other facilities were stable, reports CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether another of the wounded men might have been a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between many armed men.
The event site was full of assault weapons-type seals that come from various assault weapons.
\"It is absolutely clear that this was the ongoing battle.
There were seals on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
There have been several armed fighters, and they have been actively involved in the shooting.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I heard the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another shooting victim in the city this week was a six-year-old girl whose hand was affected by false credit when she played Tuesday in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the Olympic Team of Women's Artificial Powers, and there are more than one reason why.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnastics of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie-Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, supplemented by a Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everything proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female masquerade has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were on line 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
At the former Olympics Gabby Douglas rose as a surprise winner, and America was cheered up by the whole.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances and surprising and masterful artificial sports programmes of the three-fold world champion Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
Simon became a fourth successive American on Thursday, who won gold in a multifaceted match for women.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on his behalf, won silver.
Such views are at the top of the species, but the same does not appear to be the same in the exercise hours as the whole country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They're five last-Final Five, for in the next Olympics, only four gymnastics will be present, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that telematics are a expensive sport and gymnastics mainly practised in private telecomers, which are maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, performances, competition charges, hotel charges (trainers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
The majority of artificial sports clubs are located in prosperous residential areas capable of supporting their operations.
The teaching of telematics is taking place in these clubs, and this means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
The coach of Simone Biles Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez, Maggie Haney, have both trained the species's amateurs since they started the teline gymnastics.
We need to organise a more affordable and more accessible telematic education for countless young girls whose enthusiasm was raised by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own artificial gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for more than 15 000 urban citizens (mostly black and Latin Americans), and these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown, Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality teline jolts for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic race.
Teline powering develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits of life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has agitated the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start a teline jolt, and it's amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison's real-girl power, which you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and that you are motivated by so many backgroundd young girls to start their way into well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strike
Ministers wished to resolve the amendment to remuneration and working conditions by accepting a renewed contract with the BMA (British Medical Association) but 37 000 so-called junior doctor, i.e. 58% of the specialist physician, rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt reported on the plans to make the agreement mandatory and said that the British Public Health Service (NHS) was ‘no one country’ and that any additional delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Social Affairs Committee on BMA, gave an opinion last night, saying: \"Junior doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement; there is a particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even unresponsible in any way.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must now act, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, the junior doctors are ready for new work-fighting measures.
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception hours when nurses and consultants were asked to support the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to conclude a dispute on change by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend wage of 54,000 for junior doctors who would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS’s employees, appealed to junior doctors not to take these into new strike.
According to Mortimer: “Employment efforts achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on the teams and services already at the top of their borders and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, medical personnel and their families.
Over the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medicine Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the duties of the Inspector and the detection of irregularities.
It was desirable for workers to continue to have a positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training from career breakers, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, free of study and gender pay gap – a sign of how seriously workers, Health Education England responsible for health education and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May –
The medicine that pays up to 2.40 € per day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients are exposed to about €240 a day to pay for their medication when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and to longer use.
Anti-coagulation ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Experience) of the British Public Health System (NHS) has advised patients that ticagrelor should be given for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Experience) of the British Public Health System (NHS) has directed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people get a heart attack each year, one of which has a heart attack of another one and a quarter of which has a heart attack, or they get stroke.
As a result of heart attacks and strokes, the fat that builds up the blood vessels walls is a fat that produces posters.
If a poster cracks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is removed, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent blood flow into the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca in Britain, sold under the name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of the interpreters.
In the draft programme published today, it is recommended that ticagrelor be administered for the next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a reduction in dose to 60 milligrams, followed by administration of aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre evaluating the introduction of treatment methods says: “Although effective methods of prevention of disease and symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those taking a heart attack receive a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a very negative impact on the quality of life of man.
We have obtained evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendation on temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor are limited if used for more than three years, it is not recommended that the treatment method be used for a longer period of time.
In view of the climate of political correctness, the voting effort in Muslim areas was flourishing.
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahma, was expelled last year because of corruption, resulting in a government report
The political climate for correctness led to the closing of the eyes from widespread elections in Muslim communities, reveals today's government report.
The former Minister of Government, Sir Eric Pickles, strongly criticized the police, election observers and city councils for closing their eyes on the elections and the hypersensitivity to religion.
According to Pikles, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form security chains outside the polls so that scared voters could be protected.
He suggests that voters should present a certificate of identity in order to prove their identity when they come to the vote.
At present, the voter should only state his or her name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers be cast into the original music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
We should protect the Revelation more,\" says Sir Eric.
He calls on journalists to access the documents of the Government and to improve the decisions of informal committees and working groups.
\"The aim is not only to prevent election, but also to combat fraud against corruption and economic interests, and to promote culture more widely in local governments,\" he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the Eastern London Tower Hamlet poll scandal.
Last year, the Special Election Court ordered that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be separated from his duties because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman was abusing the religious feeling of his Muslim community, and that he weakened his critics by accusing them of racism and Islam.
Rahman was said to be the basis of his campaign that it was the religious duty of every believer Muslim to vote for him,
Of the votes, up to 300 were questionable or given on a sincere basis by making the person a voice by making himself a certain other person.
Sir Eric said they were able to get evidence of the wildfire from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the postal elections, in which members of the Muslim community's high position were told that they had pressured the people to vote on the candidate chosen by them.
Sir Eric (in picture) made a number of suggestions for correcting the voting system, including calling for an ID card at the polling station.
The report states: \"There has been evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the older members, particularly in the Pakistan and Bangladesh-based communities,
\"We were concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes on such a measure... politically due to the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion...
Sir Eric made 50 proposals for a cool system, including a ban on the handling of postal voting tickets from political activists to prevent the correction of votes.
At the moment, the report under review by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks on the registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consideration of alternatives requiring voters to present a identity certificate before voting.
Stretching the fingers into the unaltered music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality of voters and voting rights.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic mailing.
To ban the treatment of voice and mail envelopes sent by mail from political activists.
The police are entitled to form surveillance chains around the polls.
The amendment of the law so as to facilitate the rise of charges of fear under the 1983 People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at voting points.
Only allow English at voting stations (except Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure the supervision of staff, according to which only one person at a time may go into the voting box.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and thinks it's amazing that after the Tower Hamlet incident no criminal charges were brought.
\"The Court of Justice separated Lutfur Rahman and his representatives from his duties because of corruption and numerous illegal practices,\" he says.
He was found guilty without suspicion of doubt, and the threshold for evidence in criminal law was exceeded on a number of grounds.
He also criticised the ineffective controls of the departments responsible for the election lists of the City Council.
“The decision of the Court of Justice last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up, ” says Sir Eric.
\"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all Parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and hidden electoral effort carried out by some people.
The equalness of the Olympic biker with Duchess Catherine and other double beings in Rio Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild about Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a French biker, whose views with the Duchess of Cambridge are amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic Representative is not the only champion to fight for a championship who has the same vision as a well-known person.
In honor of Rio's competitions and all the famous faces in our screen screens, FEMAIL gathered a list of all the Olympic champions whose views with Hollywood publishers are obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellisonia (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the double being seen by Duchess Catherine on the Pyörösäds, many people have listed in social media how one of the bows could be an actor-friendly double brother Leonardo DiCaprio.
The American men's archer team Brady Ellison caused the storm on Twitter after the pictures he published in which he clearly resembles the star of the Wolf of Wall Street movie.
Ellison was aware of social media noise and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he was like DiCaprio.
I don't see the same view, except for the beard and the mustache, he told Brady Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment.
In London in 2012, the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris faced the same view, which will undoubtedly be even more highlighted in these races.
Alyya Mustafina, a large-eyed Russian gymnastic, has been called the double creature of Gloria Estefan, a Cuban American singer.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known as the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is a \"attletic version of an actor in the Inception film.\"
Correspondingly for a long time, the tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been listed as an equal view, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
The swimming hop-dealist, the Russian Yulia Efimova reminds the actress Annalynne McCord, not only because of his beautifully tanned skin and white hair, but also because of Nathan Adrian, the United States team, according to his fans, is a ‘atletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levittt’.
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the Dexter series actor Jennifer Carpenter (ay.), remind each other of their face shapes and eyes.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the same view.
This user wonders whether or not a couple is a good reason.
A twitter recently expressed its satisfaction when, on the Internet, there is a common view of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter.
The American football star and the Dexter series actor really look like one another with a gloomy look in their faces and eyes.
Many have also seen similarity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, who won gold, Gabby Douglas, and Anna returns!
The Olympic Commissioner of the CBC asks for his apology for the Chinese swimmer's death as a pig.
The analysis of Byron MacDonalds in the fourth place of Ai Yanhan, which was 14 years old, in the women's 4 x 200 metres free-flight message, knocked off the CBC's direct Olympic report viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize since one of its commentators said that 14-year-old Chinese swimmers had disappeared and died like a pig during the race.
Director Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 m of free-family transmission.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC semantics, was heard saying, \"This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left for speed and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14 U.S. post at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to swim into China.
The viewers from all over Canada react quickly after shocking the commentator’s voice and language use.
Emmett Macfarlane was saying, \"Does the CBC browser just say that a 14-year-old Chinese judge died like a pig??\"
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet.
At the final session of the 4 x 200 m free-up message for women, the Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as: “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with a waste of Byron MacDonald's criticisms, and many insisted on his dismissal.
The trackers didn't arrest their words when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
The Twister Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who was host to the CBC, quickly regretted MacDonald’s remarks: “We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened.
The CBC was finally forced to regret more than 90 times the people who hadwit the answer to the comment.
Scott Russel, a commentary colleague, had to apologize for MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and dragged its regret to the comments of over 90 other trackers complaining about MacDonald’s speech.
The TV company also quickly presented a public apology request.
\"We are sincerely sorry, these statements and that they were sent.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be lamented, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apologies for the broadcast and tried to defend his talks by saying that he didn't mean it personal.
I want to apologize for my comments that I gave last night after women's communication, MacDonald said on the CBC Olympics.
- I took a swimmer to do it, not a person.
And without saying it, I didn't mean anything derogatory with my words, and I'm very sorry.
In Primark, a woman who was in the middle of her underwear was shocking customers
The customers didn't know where to look when she took off in the middle of Primark to make up for underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing what he looked like in underwear, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried four underwear in a shop in Folkestone, Bouverie Place.
The Primark chain at Folkestone Bouverie Place, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children who were at the store, Jenny Davidson, tells me that after she was experimenting with underwear, a woman who was not familiar dressed and walked out of the shop without buying anything.
He says about what happened: “The people had no faith in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took the underwear off the shelf, took off her trims, and her underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it unobtrusively, but he did so with complete shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took off the underwear he tested, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back in the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided he didn't like anything, dress, and walk out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks, and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had found.
The 33-year-old Davidson living in Kent town goes on to say: “How disgusting it is to think that someone takes underpants that someone else has used and has not washed them.
It happened Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the sales staff tried to remove these clothes from sales when the woman had left – what is right.
It would be awful to take the new underwear home and see that someone else has experienced them without being washed after that, more Davidson.
Primark’s informant commented on this by saying: “Primark is aware of the situation in the traffic in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale,
This is how you defend yourself against armed assault with Krav Self
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Major Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Mag Union in New York, and asked how to cope with the gun at a close distance from the peril or the abuser.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker according to whether the attacker is approaching you in front of or behind you.
If the attacker approaches from behind, first you have to turn around so you can see the attacker and get out of the line of fire,\" says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder arm, and hit the face with your spare elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee to the neck, and when he goes into pain on a double layer, stab him on the face with a gun barrel and pull the gun against him.
The technology is the same if the armed attacker approaches the front. You have to move away from the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the fists in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off, and hold the gun against the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video of how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get you out of the robbers by giving up your cash – unless you are the Krav Magister.
The travel guide, Ian Wright, is using the dirtiest places in Europe.
The British world traveler put his resistance and the hard test of his colliding reflexes on the rise of the dirtiest and most hostile places in Europe.
Suffolkian plotter and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove their resistance by licking euro banknotes, hand screens in Piccadilly Circle, train toilet squeal and Russian general phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on the luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers to which they were banned to push.
The test was carried out in a documentary film on Ian Wright, followed by internal force, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the funnel in the train bathroom can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way to Europe at different levels, Wright challenges doctors and other medical professionals about the establishment and health of good intestinal bacteria.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused anything but an evil-flavoured mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his bowels by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt the licking of the rails’ handrails and toilet squeals challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the document: “I’ve been quite anxious about my health ever since I was a child, and I’ve put all sorts of things in my mouth, like dirt, worms and whores,
In a movie, he really showed himself to be a taxable person.
The border was only received in a gross public bathroom in Russia.
The Luminometer measured over 4,000 units of the sample.
For reasons of comparison, it should be stated that the amount in the respondent’s hands is usually less than 60.
Raja came up against the Russian general bathroom where Wright refused to lick when the snow meter measured 4000 units – in the anti-slip hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with Valio in the documentary film Ian Wright – on the trail of internal force, where the number of bacteria is made visible in various places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the paper: \"This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled anywhere in the bathroom.
4,000 units, nothing is dirtyer than that!
It's so disgusting that I'm really not licking around here at all.
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – following the inner strength in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and vitamin D, was selected to help strengthen the intestinal strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of the Valio category of snacks, juice and novelty products, says: “We wanted to offer our consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to look at, and at the same time tells us about the benefits of the probiotics.
We used a lot of time to think of something crazy, and eventually we decided to ask Ia to come along.
The health of the gut has become a global trend.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader context and tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the gut has become a global trend, and with the help of the document we can give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us our sense of humor.
Tom Hakala adds: “We say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the items we asked for, as do the Russian bathroom, which is also displayed in the film.
Of course, the licking of some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape.
In the 2015 selection survey, 84% of respondents included lactic acid bacteria, in particular, in the well-being of the stomach and intestine and 58% reported having used at least occasionally products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The family was destroyed before their eviction in Saltashi, Cornwall, a town-owned rental house.
The emergency family left 50 000 pounds of damage to the city's rental house after they had received the eviction because of the terrorisation of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skelldo and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been evicted from their home in Cornwall Saltashi following complaints against numerous couples.
When the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, the representatives of the rental dwelling company noted that the apartment was in the condition of repair.
In the walls there werevulnerable holes, floor trucks had been torn off, the trash had been spread to the floors, and the walls had been smothered with graffiti.
The couple have now changed and they are believed to live in a private dwelling.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency (Cornwall Houston), says that she is afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: “This has been a total nightmare for people living here, and no one should have to endure this kind of thing.
There is much to be weighed about, as the property is likely to become known as a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is inflamed, as it is called,
There were three boys who lived in the apartment occasionally. According to the police, the family exercised the fear of fear in the arms of the nest, the fear of the local residents, the use and transmission of drugs, and loud screaming, quarreling and curse.
The 47-year-old Skeldon signed the lease agreement received a provision on non-social behaviour in June.
Old wastes were found in several rooms of the house below the filth.
The house had previously sold drugs, and the floor trucks had been ripped off.
According to the neighbors, the family was fighting on the street, and the police regularly called.
Cornwall's housing agency terminated the couple's coercion this week after giving them 11 weeks' additional time to voluntarily move out.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction – they said that their life was the earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, \"They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived next door for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times.
This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It's gonna be wonderful now that they're finally married.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency for forced execution, says that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were invited regularly.
The trash and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: \"It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own and his family's behavior, as the exorcism is always the last measure considered by the Cornwall Housing Agency.
This case was very difficult, because the conduct was extreme and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, to the Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the community who took part in the work and showed courage to provide us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of neighbours and will send a message that non-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in the 20s.
A dirty pillow found in one bedroom after the wedding
The housing workers now have to clean up the waste boxes around the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, as well as £1 700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when he was found guilty of possession of a class B drug with a view to selling it.
He claimed the money was in his car accident in 2013 for the tombstone of his dead son, Lee Skeldon.
After being homeless, Skelldon and his husband have been heard of having moved to a private dwelling in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were covered with graffiti.
The police are saying that they insist on evicting tenants who breach the rules on leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall are saying that this eviction is a clear warning for tenants who are constantly threatening the rules.
\"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave how they want without accusations, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior,\" said Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and non-social behaviour and continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flight, beached army jet scared tourists in Portugal
The sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in the Portuguese Aveir.
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force crashed into an alarming low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists had to escape when a low-flight jet crashed across the entire beach.
From dramatic images, you can see how an army plane gets near contact distance from the sun - taking tourists in the North Portugal Avero on the sandy coast.
The vacationers rose to their feet when they were worried about the thunder of the jet engine, which began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the images and videos of vacationers in social media was Daniel Fernandos, who says: “It passed the beach twice in real low, and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash in the country.
\"I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro experienced shock when the plane suddenly came to view and flew on a dazzling low plane.
The Portuguese Air Force today reported that a P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly slightly lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires damaged visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have destroyed some of the continental Portugal and killed four people on Madeira's island.
Today, the Portuguese Air Forces reported that because of the bad visibility caused by the sand fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot was requested to identify the fishing vessels.
Exote's first half score better than expected
In June, the social and health district of southern Karelia (Exote) produced a better result of EUR 3.4 million.
The exote profit amounted to EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to eliminate institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was granted in all activities.
Exote is working to reduce the range of measures this year.
Exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The percentage that is left over may be used to shorten the lines and buy the measures for patients.
The annual result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exoten Government will discuss the mid-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special ice caps was sworn by a soldier in Immola
Of the 70 vice presidents of the Border and Coast Guard School, the military light was taken on Friday.
The military lights of the Border and Coast Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
The 10 special border icebreaker course was held in the backup sports field.
A soldier's oath was made by 70 backup men.
Special border ice creamers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, the special border ice cream was applied for by 310 young people.
They were invited to a selection test of 250.
Special ice creams have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five vets of the border forces of the war were involved in the meeting of the vetrane on the occasion of the ceremony.
The average age of those who are included is now 90 years.
Veterans who attended the oldest event have been born in 1918.
A limited amount of crime ahead - criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 Finnish police stations since the beginning of 2014, the RTA unit has been involved in criminal intelligence and analysis.
The operation of the unit is invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna are included in the Hämeenlinna police station.
It's being pulled by the Lahti-based sergeant.
Chief of Staff is working in Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everybody works in a civilian suit.
The Unit has demonstrated its suitability and necessity, considered Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides other police officers with different reports.
In trouble, it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police practice.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. to keep the police from going in less and less or less until they get the alarm.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will help target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of police, a criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, three national units were established and each police department has its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre, working in the context of the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, is responsible for national action.
PTR units are known to be working with people from the police, Tuuli and Rajavartilaitos.
The RTA units, in turn, work in areas shared by police authorities and provide information to both local police and national units.
Extensive intelligence outside its territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also goes beyond the limits of its own institution, because it also does crime.
People working in RTA have better basic police skills.
The Unit shall endeavour to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or crimes similar to each other by means of registers, alert databases and findings.
This is called saviding, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint can also be seen at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
On an artificial basis, the factor forms a certain kind of image.
It can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals Learn Their Errors
RTA employees do not carry the collars up in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
Neither own nor criminal practice is reported because it could lead to professional offenders developing their activities and thereby preventing police crime firms.
The police will report on these practices publicly if they are predicted to pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the early summer of news, the way in which empty dwellings were used in housing fractures.
In it, the authors put the outer door of the apartment into a stick, a single needle, or a tapeboard where they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest ones are ordering a record of the district court, which, for example, shows that fingerprints have been found on the site.
The next time we steal, we go with gloves.
The interview has been held with Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppa of Hämeen Police, Inspector Tuoma Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuimela from Central Crime Police.
The police are gathering and analysing information to plan practical action.
Background for a reduction in labour and financial volumes.
The first steps towards a new mode of action were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined her parents died in Syria.
News says that one of the three British students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Counselor Tasmime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in the Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike in Raqha, which is the site of Isis's base in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was just planning to flee the land of war and return to Britain.
You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and will to make people understand that this is a real risk when they go to the war zone and make people give up the decision to leave, says Akunjee.
Sultana rose in February 2015 with two other Austrian schoolgirls on a plane to Turkey and continued by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and remained a widow just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's name in the highest court if he's elected
Senator Harry Reid says he's convinced that candidate for President Hillary Clinton calls Merrick Garland Supreme Court judge if elected president.
The Senate's Republican representatives have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect a person to fill Anton's place of the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at the telephone conference on Thursday that he would predict Clinton's choosing Garland with great certainty.
Reid's informant later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton, whether this was going to be Garland's name.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to rock the boat by choosing someone else.
Garland is the head of the United States Court of Appeal in the district of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans that stop Garland's name are candidates for President Donald Trump's Villagers and Adjutants.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
According to the Treats magazine, lower calendars are as good for women as for men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemer and places on the market a 1970s style and Pirelli's inspiration calendar for 2017.
They want to find the next generation of top models of their NU Muse calendar in 2017.
The CEO of Treats said earlier this year that his nakedness is different from that of the old school's Playboy, because he said, \"Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women.
He seems to think the same about the calendar.
“We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, wherever men are involved, can enjoy and inspire these images of the female community, ” says Shaw in a press release on the calendar.
- Women certainly want to take part in this project, because it will be a beautiful work of art.
They want to send their photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: Who buys records?
Lonesome, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write a comment with the name of your angry objection EiväAllOrganicsKeski-aged Manhat, this claim is based on real research information.
According to YouGov's research firm, behind the new arrival of a lot of vinyl plates, there is no millennial knee boom when the Millennials want to feel the physical object in their hands, but instead there is a middle age nostalgic.
Recently, the age of the person who bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, between 18 and 24 age groups are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just a desire for amateurs to hug discs, but the meaning is emotional: older buyers of vinyl plates are more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you think the results of YouGov are correct?
If this blog was a television newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked along a lively Soho Street, with a gray jacket on my top of the jewelry. I'd live hard, bend my hand into a cup, and say something traditional, like, \"Let's find out,\"
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rososity when the hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before the private premises, there are still a lot of special record shops left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I apply very close to the men visiting these stores and try to monitor their age and character.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by two young women, three middle-aged men at the Sister Ray shop at the same time, at the same time as the Reckles Records (occupiedly eight middle-aged men, one possibly 20-year-old woman) are on a meeting trip to London during the afternoon and spends extra time on the offer of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
I think I am, he says.
- I have about 3000-4000 records.
These records fill his living room walls, as shown in the picture. (Stoart sent me a picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has obtained such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his available incomes. He is now able to buy records for which he could not afford when they initially appeared and buy again things that he had to sell when he was young and moneyless.
-A lot of things from the late '60s and the early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them, he says.
He agrees that those buying vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts that are comfortable with his own company, and adds: \"I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
It's my bad-ass...
Wez, a member of the Sister Ray movement, 25, also believes that many of their clients fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has found a new kind of human stream, which has been influenced by media sealing, and these people have heard about re-entry of vinyl plates and now feel obligated to buy their old records back.
In general, people had given up their collections in 1998 or 1999, based on my discussions.
The customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back, he says.
This may explain the vinyl fragrant boom of a particular age.
And what about the supposed emotional significance of discs?
Only in a few seconds will you realize in a movement such as Phonica that they provide comfort for the same types of community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have become more upset in particular with regard to the non-contact payment system.
The digital world may embarrass a part of vinyl fans, to which returning to familiar disk covers means perseverance and reminding youth of happiness days.
“I think it sometimes fills up a hole or material property for some comfort, ” says Wez.
\"I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe that so many others too.
It's an easy way to get your mind out of the way.
- We're like social workers. - Wez's working partner behind the record.
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought vinyl album had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also reported that 41% are a record player that they never use, and 7% of those who buy vinyl disc have no record player at all.
At this point, the news broadcast would probably look like a serious face, while such stacked bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of Vinyl plates is also accompanied by a \"pocalypse phenomenon\" that Jonny, 42, has been observed by a sales agent of the Sounds of the Universe (the three middle-aged men at the moment).
\"An individual customer recently came in and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a radiohead record so he can put it in his shelf, Jonny says.
\"This kind of customer is not a big one, but they do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients tell us they don't have a record player yet.
They're younger, they're not older, they're mostly teenagers who're just starting a hobby.
The customer base is much more varied at the Foppi, where I arrive next, and the movement has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl discs.
Customers include 70-year-old parasitics, photographers, teen-aged boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers makes me happy, even though the mood is not as relaxed as in previous moves: instead of gingering jazz, the latest sex of Wild Beats is a synthetizer poppy.
No client seems particularly lonely, but it is difficult to see a pale psychological trauma standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and have watched the various types of low-down records.
He's more of a look than he's doing shopping.
He says his income is small, so it's not possible to collect the records for him.
- They cost a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the violin is ......, he lets a lovely glow and continues:
I can't explain. They're so unique.
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired the new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I can see a bunch of teenage girls who would think of jumping jeans, but who instead gathers around the Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a stairwell filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the central albums to any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just a decorator and some are so high that they're not even promoted.
They're pure-art viyl-suscitation.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the sector and send some customers to the search for Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population, most likely to have more time and money than most, is also the group that spends most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although my research suggests that youGov's results are true, at least in Sohon's record shops, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans, which actually exist in both record shops and web forums.
These people are likely to be stuck closely in school or working life.
I'm sure they won't spend Thursday mornings masquerading at Berwick Street's record stores, sorting out records and avoiding 30-year-olds playing TV, staring at and looking at bad-looking middle-aged men.
Holker, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebra – video report
Researchers say the world's longest living spine is the ice shark.
According to Hai researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was obtained in a study of 272 to 12 years, which was a five-metre female.
The French court rejected the application for the abolition of the stores in the jungle camp
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities to demand that tens of temporary shops and restaurants be landed in thousands of refugees by establishing a jungle camp.
In this week's legal proceedings, the Calais authorities made claims that the State should have the right to break 72 temporary shops for refugee camps, which sell goods from tobacco to energy drinks to provide haircuts to refugees, which can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals by a few euros.
According to Calais Prefectors, these shops and restaurants must be broken down because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they are accompanied by fire and hygiene ruins.
Humanitarian aid teams told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for camp, because free meals provided by the state-supported organisation and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need it.
The Court of Justice ruled that there was no legal basis for the deportation of 72 temporary traders, but it considered Calais' prefect concerns to be fully understandable.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the food stores, cafes and restaurants of the camp are much more important than just providing food to people who live under extremely unstable conditions.
He says that they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteer workers can meet each other.
One of the places under the landing threat was the Jungle Book Kids cafe, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice for hundreds of dependent minors with the most vulnerable status.
More than 170 000 people have signed an address where the children's cafe is required to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp increase in the summer quantities, the population of the jungle camp has risen to over 9 000 persons.
Food prices in Finland are clearly falling faster than average in the EU
In Finland, food is very much reduced to the joy of consumers and to the shame of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly 5 per cent in three years, while the average price in EU countries has decreased by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen to the second largest in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
In comparison countries only in Britain, the price of food has decreased faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the article of Ilkka Lehtinen, Director of Development of Statistics Finland, published in the Information & Trends blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportional to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest is June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation had to be alarmed.
\"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership became,\" Lehtinen says.
Then a turn followed, after which the food has become cheaper every year.
Now the price is heavy on the Russian food import bans that have cut off food exports from Finland to Russia.
This is why the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
“Point’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term, ” Lehtinen says.
The tightened price competition for industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
Large trade chains Group S and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been shown to be an impressive promotional campaign.
Finland, however, is still not a low-cost food stand, even though the price of food has decreased a great deal.
In 2015, food in Finland was one quarter the most expensive EU countries with a wage level similar to Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same VAT percentage, the most cheap food would be sold in Finland from countries like the same level of wages.
The paper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the analogue countries, only the Germans and Dutch would sell more expensive food than the Finnishs.
If we want to reach the level of food in the old EU countries at the cost, VAT should be added to the average level of EU countries and the price competition continues, the Lehtinen writes.
The paper points out that the VAT rates he has calculated are indicative.
School's not exactly the same anymore.
Returning to a school bench may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curricula have been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ from old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty writing is stopped, and instead schools begin to practice the codem.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education is already being read in four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of pupils.
It was thought that the teacher taught students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
We found the world's longest spine... ice sharks can live up to 400 years.
The coolest known Greenlandese shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches maturity only at 150 years of age.
It can then live for another 250 years, reporting a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest backbone of today’s world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed by only the Icelandic family whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenlandese sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females take dogs longer, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Since the rate of growth is low, it is observed that only about a centimetre per year, adult individuals have lived by force for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined all 28 of the adult ice sharks from the 28 female who had been caught by fishermen.
The fish age was exposed to radiocarbonisation in the eye lenses.
The mean age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, amasonic fish of 493 and 502 cents, were exposed about 335 and 392 years old.
As previous studies have shown that icebergs reach up to four metres of maturity, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that point.
The research was published by Science.
Stockmann's firing almost 300 salesmen are not reduced
Almost 300 employees are released from Stockman.
Cooperative companies in a company in difficulty ended in the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs are reduced, the majority of which will be made redundant, ” says Stockmann.
According to this, the number of sellers in the goods sector is not reduced so that the customer service is not affected.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities will be offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann's y-t negotiations concerned some 3 000 workers.
At the start of their reduction, approximately 380 workers were estimated to be affected.
The reduction of the population aims at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, to be achieved next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme aimed at achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in getting profitable from the grocery store.
Even though the adjusted operating result of the Group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the commodity store is still losing.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, according to Stockmann’s CEO, sales in the stores have not reached the company’s objectives.
\"Unfortunately, the reduction of human populations is necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018 to 2018,\" says Veijalainen in the press.
The result improvement of the second quarter was particularly driven by the good Lindex performance of the supply chain.
Ketju reached the best second quarter of all time turnover and result.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating profit was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover of this year will be reduced last year.
The correction's operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The centre of low pressure on the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist from HS.
There will also be rainfalls in the middle of the country, but the southwest will be pouts.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country is less than 20 degrees below mercury.
North rainy areas remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team is playing doping scandal - an odd explanation for the coach’s pace
John Anzrah, a Kenyan general sports coach, was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah played a ground team athlete in the doping test.
The news firm AP told me that the athlete Anzrah tried to show up is a 800-metre star called Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenya County Team, reported that Anzray's identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichia in the surprise test.
Doping officials visited the Anzray authorities.
Soi says Anzrah was sent home because he committed a crime against the Kenyan national team.
He played as a athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use, for example, the President of the Kenya Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, forced the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics’ public sports begins on Friday, and Rotich is expected to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich placed last year in the World Cups on the way to the fourth and is in advance Rio winning favors.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan general sports team claimed that Anzrah only went to the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he'd be exposed, so the source told me.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s public sports stadium emptys
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least, they don't watch the public sports.
In Rio, a struggle was started on Friday on the scales of public sports, but the world's top departments were able to present their skills to a confusing, empty audience.
On Friday, Rio arranged that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day of the morning competitions and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening competitions were sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bullied with a cheerleading force.
The final tickets are already sold in Rio.
The Rio Olympic audience has been attracting attention even before sport.
For example, thousands of empty tyres have been seen in the views of rugby, melon and horse riding.
When Brazil’s medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played the beach balloon in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian twins, the Dutch played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000 people were full of the audience.
At least the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is a long way from European and Asian competitions, and many Olympic species are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to pull the football stadium to its full.
In the weekend Mario Andrada, the organiser of the competition, said that 82 percent of tickets had been sold, which is clearly less than four years ago.
- Andrada said, \"We still have 1.1 million left to sell,\"
Of the 8,5 million tickets to the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost nearly half more than Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euro to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
Volunteers and military personnel in the London Olympics were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because organisers need money and try to get tickets for last minute sale.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240 000 tickets to less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
At Rio's stadium, empty places were enough in the morning.
Even the beach balloon in the Copacabana sand has no interest in the audience.
Jukka Central Hall competed in London in 2012.
I've had a lot of people on the press.
The new way of protecting the environment - acquisition of the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through the latest ways.
The Foundation established last year acquires its ownership of ecologically significant nature areas.
After that, private, business and entities may, with money, redeem land ownership rights.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that are available to those who wish to obtain right of ownership against payment.
The holder receives a veto right of 187 square blocks, which in practice means that there is no need for approval from each holder if the use of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring governance is something concrete that can be left to your inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying the banders or chaining yourself up somewhere to protect the environment.
The administrator of the administrative authority receives accurate location data from his block, allowing for example visits in the block.
On the website of the Foundation, the names of the holders of property rights are shown in the same map of which the land block data can be found.
The only risk that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea is the Levavikangas sees as a natural conservation acquisition.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation should act in some way in an ethical or commercial way, but should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect natural areas in such a way that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or offering.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but it has acquired initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more conservation countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to move from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Centre on 13-19 August.
Wheel thieves torture most of the cities in Turkey - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torture Turkey, for the most part, from large cities in Finland.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police on the basis of the number of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to police records, four out of five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants took place.
Instead, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
The police officer Tommi Reen.
Turku Police is wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer for that.
The extent to which the city is moving around with wheels and the amount of wheels around the city may be influenced by the frequency of the events, says Teemu Ääs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise at the top of the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes very much according to which study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a completely different city, where urban centres are distant, and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary means of movement, ” Reen says.
In January to October, the whole of Finland police information has become slightly less bicycle theft than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline of recent years, the police are informed of just over 20,000 bicycle thefts a year.
It means 50-60 filters every day and only in Helsinki about 4 000 bikes a year.
- They're big amounts, Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, as only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a crime of bike theft, although less than one in ten cases notified to the police.
Typically, a bicycle theft is where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in blood.
In the case of other studies, when, for example, stolen wheels can be found in a drug case, Reen explains.
In Helsinki, bike thieves will be caught weekly by themselves or by police, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
For example, he said that the wheels are stolen from the wheelchairs, courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs of commercial centres, or virtually everywhere they are normally stored.
Most of the individual wheel models are stolen, just like the years before, Jopos.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
Some steal a bike for short-term use, for example, but much of the stolen wheels end up on sale, e.g. via the Internet.
They're gonna stay on the domestic market.
At least it hasn't come to the police's attention that stolen wheels are going very much abroad,\" Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
I'm sure some of them buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some might have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike should be careful because he may be guilty of a hide-and-seek offence or offence.
- The bells should play, if they sell their jugular bikes, - Reen says.
Special Library official Severi Hirv always wears the colourful Nopsa for his working day to protect the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He's had five pieces, but none of them have been stolen, Hirvi says.
Perhaps this isn't so attractive to thieves, this may not even have a hipster value, the Helsinkiman Hirv might wonder.
Siiri Valve, who worked at the Kallio in Helsinki, quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the wheel turned up against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his wheels on something solid, like a wheelchair.
There will be quite a lot to consider, for this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own, the Helsinki student says about his white bike, which the body alone cost about five hundred euros.
\"All the time, my friends will hear that the wheels have been taken.
- Mostly bad wheels, such dirty guys...
A bike was stolen from the guard in the inner yard of the house company a year ago.
Although the wheel had not been locked, the guard was able to wait for it to be brought.
Under 15 years of age in charge of his crimes?
Helsinki is testing comparison crews familiar to the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-fed team is being tried to prevent young people from entering the crime cycle.
The first test is applied to persons under 15 years of age who are now under criminal responsibility.
A bloodball crew is missing the first young to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer jury is discussing what happened with the offender and imposing a penalty.
A week later, the offender may himself join the peer-false crew to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has come to be done and what has been learned from it.
The youth director, Tommi Laitio, tells me that the model is not tight.
We also have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
\"All of them will guide young people's activities in a more responsible direction, so that not all will go wrong with the first mistake,\" says the Department.
A model has been taken into the comparison team from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crimes, young people do not have to face the adult panel but reflect on what happened with people of about the same age.
The model's been tried once.
The Service Design Office, which followed the trial, Palmu service designer Iikka Lovio, reports that this was an abuse that was successfully resolved.
Especially the first crimes of people under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
It's been a message that you keep on the path you've chosen, Lovio says.
The Vertaisavalamény is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
The logo underlines that new ways of action are offered to all who need it, not just to immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft from it to see it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money transferred to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
\"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his recklessness, incompetentness and record disadvantages, threaten to bring to these elections a voice call,\" says Politico.
Only the direct direction of all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in Trump's decorative anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning presidential elections are falling by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the members of the letter’s organization is clearly the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes the Trumps.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from people who want to protect the majority of the parties in Congress, and that it is not for anyone to support.
The letter lists a number of actions by Donald Trump, who are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authorityal tendencies.
Earlier this week 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton's permission to facilitate the US's families with children
In the United States, Democratic President-designate Hillary Clinton reported on the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president so that the U.S. economy can go well for everyone.
\"Donald Trump's trying to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends,\" Clinton said in his speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve the U.S. infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by rich tax increases, in part by private money.
The program is hand-held to the American duunares who suffer from the conversion of factories to the land of cheap work.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he also sounded like Sanders to stress that rich people should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company goes from the United States to tax, it has to pay off the tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
As a President, I object to all trade agreements that operate against employees or wages, and Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published in The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the financial program published by Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it would recommend only these kinds of millions of dollars.
As regards the reduction in corporate taxes proposed by Trump, Clinton has previously called \"Trump's loopholes\".
Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneurs himself.
He reminded hearers of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
If he wants to make America great again, he should start making his own products in America, and Clinton would do it.
These include Rio's viewers: Kisats have not glued Finns to the edge of the squares, but the mobile application is interested
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics on sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached the peak of viewers.
At one time, the races have been glued to the top of the squares by 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night swims followed by Ylen Olympic TV2 at the same time by 615 000 viewers.
Because of comparison: one month ago, the EM competitions received nearly 800 000 viewers at the same time as TV2, and the EM competitions in football were quite another million.
The Olympics have so far been most interested in Sunday night biking, and the fifth day of the race opened the telinejítításe, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers at the same time.
Yle Sport Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures and reminds us that the viewers are distributed at Rio Olympics for the first time in several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers are elected by the Olympics.
In addition to television, TV2 and Yle Fem channels are distributed.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competition Yle has dedicated the whole channel to.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London competitions or in the 2008 Beijing competitions, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s race broadcasts will come to the nighttime in Finland.
Another reason for his dilute interest - if one of them is found to be thin now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some kind of surprise medal out of the initial competitions, the interest would have come up with it.
In addition, sport is just beginning, as are other Finnish interesting species: sailing and horse riding.
At first, according to Pokkinen, the number of viewers has been near expected.
When the sports starts, the audiences explode.
Yle launched a Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the race at the Apple App Store for the most downloadable free app.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're already on the road to 200,000 downloads.
- We'll only get the numbers on the network later,\" says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked on all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
Rio Areena has been associated with delay and other small technical problems in the initial phase.
Applications have been updated to correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are seen in Ylen channels and arenas more widely than any other sports event ever before.
You can follow some species from Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Kee is passing the race daily.
Olympics are not only working animals to Yle ever, but the last ones you can follow from Ylen channels only.
Since 2018, Olympic sports will be seen both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is your sun, with a depth of 95,3 metres on the Ristinsel.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical shuttle trainer, found a weight of about 20 square feet [20 sq m] from the Cross-Ristise, the bottom of which the dive computer showed a depth of 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to insure the observation by waiving.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 metres, says the development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Over 80 metres away from Saimaa, Toisvesi and Lake Capital.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sunshine.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
There might well be some unidentified depths. Kannela's wondering.
If the deepest lake is defined using the middle depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In view of this, your sun will not enter into the ten deepest groups, and Suvasvez is still further away from the top.
Correction on 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: The last piece corrected, where the deepst lakes were wrong.
Inhospital tax base: Pension tax is becoming more and more intense
Pensioner taxation is becoming more severe than payees.
According to Ihalainen, the situation was raised under parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal compared to employees.
This is not part of the government's presentation.
We believe that it should definitely be in it.
The promises made should be kept in line after the election, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received a reduction in their income, which reduced taxation.
In the Parliament, the case increased the representatives of the opposition, which shriveled from the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (cok.) of electoral promises.
The purchasing power will be secured, it won't grow.
In line presented by Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpon (kok.) on tax reductions is, according to Ihalainen, mainly about safeguarding purchasing power and not increasing, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax reductions have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Orpo's messages with the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with difficulty.
He says that it is important for credibility to keep an agreement.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It needs to be done because the economy has so much domestic demand and people's own confidence in the future.
Long-term unemployment
It calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of raising the employment rate will be to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social fall.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in Thailand's attacks
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy calls on the Finnish people in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
After all, Finnish tourists intending to Thailand have no reason to withdraw because of the explosions, but it is advisable to follow the instructions of the embassy, says Westphalen.
Thailand with very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for one year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook following bomb attacks.
The Embassy has tried to target Finns, especially in Hua Hin, to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the factor
According to Westphalen, there's no information yet on the cause of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that events may be related to the political unrest of the Thai divided society and to the last week's referendum on the Constitution for a military junta.
The Act was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, the ethnic and ethnic conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, no attacks have been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
He said that the town celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very little.
The impact of the impact on the day’s course of action is that the authorities are extremely careful in terms of safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are local sabotage, and they're different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, reports Thailand's police news office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people died during the 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourist's favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a popular tourist destination, too, four bombs exploded at Phuket at night, reports Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death.
Two bombs, according to the magazine, exploded in the hands of the across the city.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nguyen, where one person, according to the magazine, was wounded.
In the popular tourist destination, Hua Hin, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
In both double bombings, at least one died.
In addition, in South Thailand, Deaths in Than village and the city of Trang exploded at least one bomb.
At least one person died in both attacks.
The Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, for it is the way to travel to the resorts of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The factor in the impact is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military junta that controls Thailand is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't panic more people, he said to the reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told the Thai BSB that the agents were meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks had occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the Finnish people in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
After all, there is no reason for the Finns who are going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of the explosions, but it is recommended that the large-scale instructions be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
In wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
From last night's attack in Hua Hin, we have time to get some more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's second attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of a bell tower known to be visible.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin from which it believes it has found another bomb.
The dead Than bomb was hidden in a flower cap according to the governor of the county.
In the impact, the municipal employee died.
There's at least one wounded.
According to the officer interviewed by CNN, two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded approximately half an hour ago.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Bales won women's four matches

Biles, 18, reaching Rio's race for more Teline Championships on the perman, jump and boom.

For the last three years, he has eight personal World Championships.
He's won three times in a row and a boom last year and another year.
The United States team, Bales, has reached two teams' World Championships.
Biles got jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: \"The person has no influence on tourism\"
Esa Huovila, who runs a playground in Phuket, Thailand and the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think that anything more amazing will come about, estimated Huovila as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for some twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of tragedy in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First was tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
I don't think this is what it's like. If these past tourists haven't banished tourists, I don't think so either.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said that you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street of Bangladesh Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at approximately 10 o’clock in local time.
Many had not even heard of attacks on the beach.
At about half a day, Thailand had traffic normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been rather small, says Huovila, who visited the scene.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupy on the Jouxholm road.
When the police got there, they set the car on fire.
The party found two men matching the symbols hidden in a nearby hexagon.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and causing serious damage to the engine vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director of Russian leadership changes: Clear removal
On Friday, a high-ranking change of leadership was made in Russia, when President Vladimir Putin separated the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian-style, 44-year-old Anton Vayo.
He's an ex-diplomat. He worked for Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason why Ivanov's separation can be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling of management tasks is one of the ways in which power is being used.
This is a way of preventing people from begging themselves, independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been congested or screwed by other leaders.
Ascension of Ivanoville
Ivanov, within the Putin, will be transferred to the specific tasks of environmental and transport matters.
On a tape from the state media, Putin said that it was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and suggested that Job be replaced, told Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear loss of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's priorities.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russia's power.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the President's Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin at KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnöniem, from the Foreign Policy Institute, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place, that Putin is becoming younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they withdrew in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape into the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, the Arabs and the Kurdishs received around 90% of the important Manbij city of Isis.
However, it is estimated that tens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
The repaired news earlier at 19:30: In the past we mistook that civilians were running from the city, the really Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: Independence of the Ministry of Interior document release line
The guidelines of the Ministry of Interior on the publication of documents are illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells the STT that the public cannot base the document on the Authority’s own guidelines, but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of Interior refused to give up the list of participants in the Ministry of Interior events to East Sanomim.
The Minister gave reasons for the decision by the Government Secretary's instructions and the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's communication director tells the STT that there is a need to reform practices at the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt's been fighting back for a while.
From the beginning, he hurt his way back and had to pass on the Olympic maps of Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I'm much better at it.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small-scale champagne dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt is surrounded by the fact that the Jamaican star has risen during the era when sport has been struggling with doping scandals and suffocating interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympics came to Athens in 2004, when he was cut off in the 200 - foot [200 m] opening time on 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that they slowed down your injuries and loosened your training position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began by a hundred feet [100 m] in which he crushed the world record and the confidence of competitors during the time of 9,69, despite the end of the celebration.
This is harder.
A year later, in Berlin's World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the end of his career at the clock.
World records born in Berlin are still valid at 9.58 per cent and 19.19 per hundred.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his pursuit of a 200-metre world record and a substation of 19 seconds, but no one else believes in it but Bolt himself.
The challenger of the Satasella Bolt is Justin Gatlin, the 100th Olympic winner of Athens 2004.
Last year in Beijing's MM-final, Bolt lost the American with only one hundred-seconds.
Bolt has not lost in the finals of the prize competitions during his reign that began in Beijing, if only he has made his way.
In Daegus in 2011 the MM-final remained without running from Bolt because of the flash-off.
Bolt fills up in a lot of weeks, 30.
He's an old man in a young man's race, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The last goal of the career, Bolt has set up next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest of them.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the lower world, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.
Disseminations from Rio: Two athletes are suspected of a doping crisis
According to Xinhua, China’s National News Office, Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive drug sample at Rio Olympics.
There were traces of banned substances in the doping sample of China’s Sire Chen Xiny.
Also, the Bulgarian drinks Silvia Danekova is suspected of a doping crisis.
In addition, the Chinese general sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample with signs of epo hormoneone.
He was placed in Rio in the fourth place in women's butterfly showers of 100 metres.
According to Estao, the Brazilian newspaper has taken its doping cases before the International Court of Appeal (CAS).
Xinhua says that the sample of Xiny's Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping episodes have also been shown in Rio.
The BBC reported that the Bulgarian women's drinks Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample with signs of epo-hormon.
Kenya has, for its part, transferred the public sports coach from Rio to the home of the public sports coach because of the doping thing.
On Thursday, the International Olympics Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had become a athlete at the time of the test and had given the doping sample for this.
According to the media data, this is John Anzrah, a Chinese quick drink coach.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of a 800-metre runner called Ferguson Rotich.
There's no stopping the Phelps - the historical gold came into the display style
The most successful athlete in Olympia history, Michael Phelps, U.S.A., was able to win his 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' payout was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in the confusion before Wang Shun in China.
I'm just trying to have some fun. I'm just trying to have a BBC Olympic Commander Helen Skelton laughs at a quick interview in the afternoon.
Helen Skelton (albeit) on Monday, the case is much more detailed this week on the website of the evening magazine.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if there is a small noise in the media or in the British press about his exposed and special costumes.
The TV's a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton has dressed in high-pitched shoes and shorts in a dress with at least enough openness to the eyes of many conservative British warriors.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and the little noises are just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skelton's trying to scare you, and maybe he's trying to upset you, but he insists that you don't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
Here we are watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress up.
Can you imagine that the juice has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that points to how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skello's got it.
You know what?
It's a treat from nothing if it comes from wearing (the driver).
I'm just a little amused to have this kind of thing hit somebody's radar.
Rio's police committed two arrests for acts of terrorism.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that it has arrested two people for terrorist acts.
The police made arrests in connection with the security control of the race.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group, which was already arrested by the police in July.
The arrests are believed to have links with the Isis extremists.
The arrests had known to have triggered violence in social media.
Violent messages of violence were distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
Rio is responsible for the safety of 85,000 police officers.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in a basketball arena and closed the place as a publicist.
The police let the public in after a controlled blow-up package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics when the police have performed a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed the arena because of the suspicious package we found there.
The public got in when the police had turned up the package in control.
The audience did not return to the audience by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a suspicious package that was found for others.
The police blew up the package and let the public go to government until after that.
The tank woke up the race with a dream of starting the Spanish team.
With two losses, the contests started by Spain won the Nigerian point 96-87.
In the two previous races, Spain achieved silver.
The police have already carried out a controlled explosion mission for the third time during the Rio summer race.

The Argentinian lady dressed Petija-Siren - Finnish thought of protest
The wind in Petajaj-Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The wind in Petija-Sire went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady dressed Tuuli Petija-Siren on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day in Rio.
There was a clear breach of the wind.
The opponent admitted a breach.
Because of the crash, he got stuck, and the others ran away, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing that, because, according to the Olympic rules, it would have been useless.
I should have dropped in the water to get a refund, Petajaur-Siren said.
The Finnish was hanging on his board until the last time, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
Suomalainen left her place 27 with a crash.
In the overall situation, London’s 2012 Olympic hop pool is the eighth.
The accident didn't seem to have much effect on him.
Friday is an important day when the race starts at 10-12.
Modified 0.39: By way of derogation from the first information, Petajaj-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Matters which, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between Earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring further years to a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
At times, things that can't be influenced by a person can bring him more years.
These include, among other things, a tendency towards mid-life or social status.
Regular shopping can extend age.
You don't always have to hit me. Just apply for a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought by many different studies.
Medical Daily introduced seven strange results.
According to science, all these things may lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.
The University of Harvard survey found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of death, particularly in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, there are once again studies that suggest that using it for one of three days could extend life.
For example, one noticed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of the toothpaste can extend the life of a person for up to six years, says a study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation of the gum.
They can, on the other hand, contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
The survey in Norway explained how laughter affected man’s lifetime.
The seven-year project observed over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when sexual diseases are taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition to everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, it's just not enough to have sex as such.
In order for a person to receive further years of his life, he should also receive orgasm.
Traffic, of course, brings further years, and there is no denying it.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute legal certainty.
One study by Oxford University found that women with a big buttock had lower cholesterol levels.
Their bodies also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it was an actor who won the Olympic medal, or Oscar, he was more likely to live longer than a regular bulldozer.
A lot of research has been trying to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings further years of his life.
On the other hand, some researchers suspect that a long time ago is due to a person's social status - which, for example, allows the pursuit of confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping daily, probably less likely to make a shopping parent.
This is due to the fact that in concrete shops rotation reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
So let's count your credit card with your hand, the online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Umpihulainen driver's drink fell towards the truck
A serious truck and passenger car pickup cave took place on Friday night in Koskke, real-time.
The accident occurred in Koskella, between Koskenti and Sorvastoti on Friday at 2 p.m.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa when the passenger car that had come to Forssa had drifted onto the same lane, hit the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was standing up, but it started burning.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car slipped through the fence and from there over the door to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car remained in her car.
The rescue facility disembarked the injured driver from his car and was transported to the treatment of the University Hospital of Turku.
The result of a woman's blow test was 2.02 prom.
He's suspected of having a serious bike drink.
The mail sent her to the wrong town.
There were deficiencies in Salon K-Citymarket's lattice selection because the mail had delivered some of the load accidentally to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, living in Pernio, was on Thursday, buying clothes from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the loose, because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
So if there's no congestion in a lawn stick, it's locked in a sign.
The sticky sign of the shop is related to the fact that the Posti extended its services last spring to include lawn cutting.
The food sandwich is available at the Post offer until the end of August.
In his opinion, the sign was mainly amusing and he decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with an abstinence.
Also, media representatives have been calling all the time, and this is an incredible observation, Haltia wonders.
Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in a bag of loose decks, even though a few camps were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesio, responsible for the business of the Post Transport Services, regretted the damage to East Sannom.
The background is that three of the five stages were misinterpreted yesterday (Seinajoki) and three of us no longer went to do part-delivery (Saloon) but only five staged today, Kaidesoo told East-Sanom.
It was the first news of the evening Sanomas.
Teija Halt wasn't upset about the sign because she found a selection of all her own iron arch favorites.

During the three-month gymnastic period, five pounds fell eventually.
The wish of a woman murdered in Lovis: Remembering the victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, the 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovisa hopes that the victim would be remembered for the benefit of a police dog instead of flowers and addressees.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published an Facebook update, which gives the victim's family a wish for contributions to police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had done a job as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinary Centre and had also completed a nurse's training there.
The veterinary station remembers the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, humorful and unafraided.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred to.
The update refers to the fact that donations are made to police dogs as a whole, primarily to the acquisition of security vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old loyal woman was murdered in her own yard in Lovisha Koskenkylä.
The women's neighbors have told the evening magazine the victim has been very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman, and they had no connection with each other.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog named Börje, who was wounded in an arrest situation life-threatening.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Post a judgment on the infringement of the Act of Equality
The post did not have the right to arrest the salary of the employee who refused to study the agency, assessed the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court obligated Post to pay most of the salary arrested to the employee and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a portion of the supervisor’s salary, which was responsible for the proportion of the study for the whole day’s work.
According to the District Court, workers had been placed in a more favourable position, in violation of the Equality Act, on the basis of their trade union activities.
The staff member had complied with the Union's organisational decision in the field of postal and logistics on the ban on supervision.
During the Post Office of November last year PAU adopted a decision that Post workers will not be familiar with temporary workers who break strike.
The first thing that happened was the People's News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and human rights-responsible development, writing in response to the Journalist Alliance by Prime Minister Juha Sipiä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.).

Putin fired the head of his administration from the Estonian-style Vauno
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned the Head of Presidential Administration, Sergei Ivanov, Kreml.
Karl Vayo's grandson Anton Vayo, head of the Soviet-Viro Communist Party, will be present.
It is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
According to the Kreml report, Ivanov, which is part of the close internal context of Putin, is transferred to the specific tasks of environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and suggested that Vaoto be replaced, Russian Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in a spying KGB.
Many considered Ivanov possible as Putin’s successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2012 before Putin re-election in 2012.
The BBC: Manu's giant buy-out to the game ban won't be seen in the opening of Valoligan.
The world record man for football transfers will not be seen in the field when the British Valolit is kicked off during the weekend.
Paul Pogba's no-play ban followed England.
The Manchester United’s giant acquisition of Paul Pogba is on the side of the game because of the ban on the opening of the ManU’s league against Bournemouth on Sunday, reported the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society Juventus paid EUR 105 million from Pogba.
However, the UK football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, for Pogba was left to the Juventus to be held under a no-game ban.
He received two warnings from last season's Italian cup, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba’s next seam to play is the league in the second round on August 19th, when ManU meets the Southampton.
Flow's big-time madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event, marked by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival walkers have typically expressed themselves in their own personal clothing.
One of the main artists is this year's punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is stagnated with, inter alia, artificial grass and art theatres.
It has never been enough for us to have just a headgear and a beer, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in the Summer Gulf of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to dozens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind the success is simple: What kind of event would the authors like to go?
There's a little bit of a difference in events that we're thinking about.
Often the aim is to achieve the level of necessity and operate in accordance with the rules of authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event, that Flow would be sold again this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of visitors with 5,000 people last year.
This year, a group of interesting Finnish and foreign artists will be seen.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point mass would be like a herd that is controlled by a huge route.
That's not what we want.
Over the 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been highlighted in such a way that there are 130 performers, art theatres and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main and smaller platforms, this year, the tent of 15,000 people operates as a jobplace.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more easily.
Maybe I'm a little bit of a freaky, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to the Rock is that even today, great visions are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of around EUR 20 000.
Last year the company’s net sales to Flow were around EUR 6 million.
It's a way to make-and-creise stuff, like building that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own personal clothing.
In addition to the music event, the community of trendy young adults can be discussed.
However, this event has not deliberately been profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to break up with content, first and foremost.
Yet fashion phenomena are also suitable for Flow's world of values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is a red legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rappies, and soul-combing festivals that are the most typical performers.
According to Kallio, Iggy was bullied because now is probably the last time this is seen on a job in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what they call on commercial radio.
Iggy's last record is damn good and he's been doing a hell of a good job in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist parasitic bombs were hidden in the flower pots... the tourists fled in their terrors.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs had been hidden in a flowerpot and blew up with cell phones.
Bombs were placed on a street, most of which are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, reported a police representative named Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, the wild animal protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, wrote a plagiarising picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can look at it from here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and told me the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It happened in one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs at Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, even by favoring the Finnishs on the island of Phuket, two bombs exploded.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, Hua Hin had a second double bomb shot.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they had discovered at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had yet to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel troops behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the operations of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken over the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new forces will go into battle in a war situation first
In an acute military situation, the military officers are told to do battle tasks only after several months of taking a military oath, says the Central Finnishman.
According to Chief of Defence Training, Brigade General Jukka Sonninen, who has been interviewed by the newspaper, in a military situation of, for example, 5.5 months, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for battle.
According to the head of training, first the reserve members of the teams are assigned to the service.
No backup or reserve member shall be ordered to carry out a mission for which no required training has been carried out, Sonninen says.
Previously in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are taking up the training of backup personnel for immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military activities already during military training.
Pamela Tola's been paid for the home house.
The actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, Pauli Waroma, have won a hard fight from the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The trading price of a two-stored single house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused a dangerous microbial growth rate for health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in its condition in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price discount from the seller there.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both cutting and homicidal law.
The court gave judgment on Wednesday.
It was in force in a judgment of the District Court ordering the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the trial and clearing expenses of the couple.
The right to a slightly lower price, since some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the purchasers when it was trading in housing.
However, according to court law, the manifest building errors were essentially more serious than what was presented.
Tola was looking for a home of goodwill.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought the home of goodwill because they did not want to take up repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the aspects mentioned in the Health Check Report were not harmed.
The Health Check Report referred to the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rainwaters and melting water that flow along rock learning.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma felt that rainwater from the rock might have to be driven a little over a few years.
The goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the dwelling were much more serious than they thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed that microbes are due to both rock rainwater and capillary soil pollution.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated by the microbes, according to the inspector’s assessment, was also able to enter the indoor area as well.
For healthy risks, limit values for over mold or yeast were found in the brush samples in the homeroom, the basement stairs, the living room window box, and the basement washroom.
Steels were built without permits.
The court also contested whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The Court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make illegal changes to the housing.
Among other things, terraces were built even though there were no adequate permits.
However, home problems were a central issue in law.
According to the court, the purchasers could assume from the seller before they were sold that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was not a need for measuring repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that there was no specific reason to carry out a wider routine inspection.
The purchasers have not neglected their reporting obligations; the court states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - also Finns in the register
The journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article on how documents recorded in the U.S. Maryland National Archives have been recorded for microfilms, covering a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi bridesmaid.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi German breed agency.
The department was acting under the leadership of SS director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
Andersson stated that gynaecological studies were carried out in women to investigate the matter.
The Breeding Office examined women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The aim was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and to give the breed agency the lives written and good recommendations from close relatives.
The department wanted to guarantee that women were very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very good national socialists who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bridesmaid of SS men.
The story does not tell us how 14 Finnish women found in the archives documents went to the end of the story.
The SS directors created a programme supported by the State, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that each SS man should have four children, either married or outside.
Lebensborn homes care for children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, reports on the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for access to children.
The German mother’s honoraryist was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and non-Aryans were legally prohibited, the museum's pages are stated.

Jari Sillanpää's satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours at night:
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for more than 20 years.
From the cruise ship’s barmaid to the 1995 tango kun, the most sold solo artist in Finland, and the Sillanpää jacket, as stared by dancers and painters, continues to smother and he is now in a gloomy climb.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppenen, was published on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The career of Sillanpää rose to a total rise in his victory in the Tangong King’s crown on the Tango market in 1995.
At the contest Sillanpää sang tangos, but she had already planned some different music for herself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tango piece to Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen agreed to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna piece thus became one of the most popular pieces of Finnish music history.
The book states that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so dressed!
The silkhead remembers in the book.
You wouldn't think it'd be in the hang of singing it in a hangover.
Although I wasn't physically my best, it was still good.
I learned that all the time, you don't have to insist on yourself being perfect and top.
Another incident related to the most popular copies of the man, which the book says, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanpää resigned from his partner then, and the case ended up with you earning gold in texts published as singles in 2014.
The book says that Sarah’s songs ordered from the Cove were not the same as Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a story about his own life, but the words of a song about the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 days.
In the newspaper’s news, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loved one was told about Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol use, but Jar said that it was full of pubs and was not true.
Jari called the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it and good.
In June, the British surprised themselves, too, by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the polls for the voting week anticipated the opposite result.
British ecosystems and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the difference, although a couple of individual researchers could disagree with the power flow of their profession.
On the basis of Western politics, the former President of the United States Bill Clinton's election campaign, It's the economy, the studios, flew to the ruin in the British Brexit vote.
The Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy seemed not to be the most important policy issue.
The Economic Scrutiny
Centre for Macro-conomics tiva in the latest month's survey of professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economies were not listened to because this time the voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of the economic loss of economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, and that is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many also have the idea that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe in economic arguments because the consensus of the Economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, the BBC’s equity was reduced, which only provided a small proportion of the EU’s economic scientists with a difference of eco-nomics compared to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested to tell what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE think about the consequences of the difference.
These remote combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if economimist messages were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because economists represent an elite with which voters do not share common interests.
The academics of major cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Immigration, too, is an economy
The overwhelming argument of the Brexit vote on immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant rushes your hospital, an immigrant uses you for it.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical time if they weren't?
There are children of immigrants in every school.
How much easier would the children of the right British get a place of school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the protagonists have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists failed to answer them and, if they did succeed, their answers did not get any visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU migrants - are the net contributors of the British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund reserved for Brex in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments correspond to the Finnish Pertti Olden.
According to him, in Aberdeen, early Brexit was prepared by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the camp in favour of the EU difference, began to be prepared more than a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be high.
It took care that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When the Brexi took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, the old man says about Aberdeen's only open day not to mention the real estate fund that the news relates to.
According to the old people, the normal value would be between 15 and 20 per cent.
At that time, the fund was worth GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is around GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest amount in the nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all British real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
So the real estate funds reserved for Brex in various strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp for the difference in the EU won, Europe went awoke.
However, the few weeks that followed the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Oldman.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by the President of the Central Bank of England, Mark Carney, where he estimates that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the Real Estate Funds first, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, these brought the situation to an end and brought the matter to the main findings of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Old man.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started to spin, and after that, the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but that too had to be frozen for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close trade but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were allowed time to consider whether money should now be drawn out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take out your money now, it's not worth it because it's going to make losses.
It calmed down, and most of them cancelled the report.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very peaceful for a few weeks, says the Old One.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner-Europe funds did not have any similar upheaval.
However, there were a lot of questionnaires.
Insufficient attention to real estate funds
The older people felt that the closures of real estate funds were given disproportionate attention.
The open funds for closures account for about 4% of the British real estate.
Aberdeen's lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on half of 2017.
Today there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not appear to be more important to Aberdeen.
The biggest issues are now the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, the Old One points out.
In addition, the retail price and the dollar rate are at its lowest level for 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought mines to London Real Estate Market
Two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look so good yet.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is going over Plan B now. Old man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was on his way to work right away.
London City was already fully alive, despite the morning.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office changed the news, and usually the loud people were quiet to listen completely when Prime Minister David Cameron entered the camera in the morning to tell about the difference.
When the market opened up, the evidence ends flashed red.
It was a morning that he would never believe in, says Old Man.
It is not because, despite the mystery, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate stores on the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company had been well prepared for the alternative, and that is why the situation was kind of peaceful, says the Old One.
The Brexit vote started the correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
We've got a little bit of a crash. The British leadership's on the switch.
The market was expected to lead to a sharp fall in the British real estate market, especially in London.
In London office premises, up to 20% of the mines were expected in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
That's what Aberdeen did for six days.
Now the poison is down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
Although it did not show up on its last summer holidays on the faces of Old Man who was in Helsinki this week.
He believes it is far too early to say much about what is going on with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland responds to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already become a primary source of information.
The CBRE data of the real estate service company covers about a third of the market.
They say that the prices of all properties in London decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the negative was 6.1 per cent, and the old man lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're months of change.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, says Oldman.
All the same fall hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis which started on the US real estate market.
The old man believes that the parable is not quite good, because it is now a British home-like crisis.
Even the atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has now not seen any panic sale like that, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says the Old One.
The financial position is also found as normal.
The repair movement could have been in front of us in any case
As a matter of fact, it's not a miracle of him that the price fixing process could have been in the face of something like this without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world cities have been too high for years.
For two years now, we have said that City and, in particular, the offices are overpriced, says Oldman.
So the fall began very high.
London's prices have written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has grown as well.
Another big trend is that properties are the last category of ownership that is globalized, says the Old One.
New entrants have entered the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate sites abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, low interest rates have been fed, making it necessary for pension companies, for example, to look for revenues from new sites.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to the old man, the debt relief has now been used considerably less than in the period prior to the crisis in 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the rise in prices settled last summer, says the Old One.
Aberdeen also began to reduce its ownership in London, and last year it was a net seller.
There was some kind of a turn to wait, and now it came.
So, what's going on here?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the Old One.
He's afraid to evaluate the future, but he's saying there's hardly any uplifts.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or a steady passage ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, for he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the hole can be solved by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If you're scattered, the risks are also scattered, the Old One says.
The S-Group will start to register more information on purchases
The S Group will soon know what you are eating, because the group today told us that it is starting to collect more accurate information on the purchases of its parent clients.
When data have been collected so far from the total amount of receipts, the group will start to feel bad about the products purchased at the beginning of May.
Group S follows Kesko here, because data on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to Ismo Riga, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data shall be collected with the agreement of the customer and used in a licensed way for marketing purposes.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
A little bit of a customer has banned the use of product information, Riitala says to the House of Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the change in the registration of Group S.
Kesko is already classifying his client according to food purchases only to ten groups.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
Data is used for customer-oriented marketing.
Product-specific purchasing data are collected only from K-group's own chains.
Co-operation partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a master client program and this is not the case.
The Finnish Middle Shop has its own One-Bondonus customer programme, which can be associated with the Valantalos, Siwos and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect data on product or group of products, we stick to the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchase was made, and that day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level like the K-Group or the S-Group, says the commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, it is to be reformed in the future, but the Middle Trade will tell you about it later.
However, the Ora does not permit the registration of product information.
First Trial
So far, the SOK customer register has been relatively large.
In addition to personal and address data, basic information has included occupation, training, housing, birth years and previous personal data of children.
People belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and payment method have been recorded in the S-Participation.
In addition, information from S-bourners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will start to be saved in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data are currently recorded at product group level in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains.
For a longer time, customers have had the hope that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of SOK’s customer owner and partner business.
The S-Group says they're reporting a change to their customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored on cats in any case, whether it or not.
Halukas can check your stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash register cannot access the information, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila's baby is Tulli's latest dog fixation - the prophecy becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador performer's puppy is scribbling five boxes of the same country lined up at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it's firmly sitting next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio will reward his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
From the box next to Heila's seat, the jar was exposed to a bottle of seals that hit the square gas.
Roast gas is the first smell that Heila and Heila have now been practicing, says Suntio, the owner of Heila dog.
Safety situation and access to online commerce
Heila is a dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives in Tulli and is placed at work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also be taken to other border crossings and ports when needed by Heila and Suntion.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job since the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels were caused by measures and attacks in Customs have been confirmed, says Tulli's chief inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to the duties of Customs for training arms and explosives dogs is mailing via Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet store, up to 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, among which arms and explosives may be ordered abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, the Customs has made available around 300 weapons, ammunition, ammunition, explosives and source materials related to online shopping, passenger mobile equipment and air freight.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It's going to look into recorded travel supplies and mail.
In ports it will be of great benefit in future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research,\" Grönberg says.
On the basis of Heila's performance, Customs estimates whether weapons and explosives dogs will be trained more in the future.
Grönberg's hopeful attitude to the idea.
School in the church
Heila-pennu is coordinated by the Customs Dog School, which is located in Kirkkonummi.
The Sun will also visit the police and the Defence Forces' experts in training with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and with the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide, together with other authorities, what smells Heila is taught to identify.
They are always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki Airport are Customs six drug dogs, as well as money and drug dogs Massi.
The Labradorizer Heila has been chosen from ten puppy cubs.
The selection criteria for the dog to choose at the airport include tearing and hunting, as well as peace, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close friend to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila for one-off stand.
The night-to-day cameraman will lose the camera's mask to the fast dog, but Heila will return the soft toy-like shield from the speed-hound.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
The next level tests will be carried out in October, which will assess whether or not education is sufficient for the work to be carried out.
Heila can be seen at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the working vest on the dog, reminds us of Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is around EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Workdays can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours can only last from 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of working dogs is a hard competition in Customs.
Heila owns about 20-30 Tulli employees.
The happiness hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Customs.
The mini-state got its first Olympic medal - the people get the day off.
With less than a million inhabitants, the Fiji Olympics in rugby are valued in the country so high that the government has appointed the 22th day of August for a national holiday.
According to the land broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the issue after the championship was settled.
We'll have the day off to take the team home the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by the final in the capital of Suva, where the stadium had a screen.
Normally, only the naive Fijins are interested in rugby, but this game linked our cultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said the Fiji Times journalist to Maigle Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish singer passed out after the wild performance
During his last attempt, Mr. Milko Tokola managed to gain a weight of 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the rises of the wrists, he has been fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola produced 175 kilos and 145 kilos of pressure.
His joint score was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his job on his last 175 kilos, just like the other one.
The third company’s weight increased as a result of the loud screaming.
The body of your body would drop under the pressure until the judge accepted the lift.
The joy of a Finnish teacher was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired an Estonian breeder Prosan - Vegetative Liiga - East Sanomas
The Rovaniemi Ballo Club, which plays the men's football league, has concluded a lasting agreement with the Estonian champion Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a top player in our team with power and a threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With over ten players, we went through over 50 players from all over the world.
A good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, reported in the newsletter, began to break down the small seal.
Prosa, 25, arrive at the RoPS from the tallest Flora where he made a total of 51 goals at 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian National Team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Seinäjoki River, where the Rovanie bees meet the master SJK in Finland.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, the secular king of last season moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family Star is once again in line: The teenage shorts reveal almost everything.
Ariel Winter, well known as Alex Dunphyna of the Modern Family series, is again raping by presenting her proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts, which do not leave much imagination available.
The Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently paid attention by making its style and behavior much more courageous.
The star has posed in his social media images in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very limited costumes.
Winter, on the threshold of eternity, has recently published several photos of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Previously this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed her film so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had been undergoing a kind of Hollywood-style transformation from child star to adult.
He's been on television for almost his whole life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more show surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood receives, Palmer says Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has lost some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not hard to guess where he will be in ten years from now, when the lowland is already about as hard, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
Instead, some of the women's fans defend the actor and invites him not to give a damn about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what people say.
You're inspiration for a lot of women, you're a young woman.
Japanese people prefer to go to Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are being lured with revivings: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy tale of terror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the renovations for the beginning, says Visit Finland in the press.
Inari and Levi are the main points of the Japanese northern tourism.
The northern lights are the armour cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly connected to the winter and beautiful landscapes.
In the winters of Lapland, we have a very high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the reviving season begins early in the autumn and continues to be long in the spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called \"meror aurora\", where the lake's surface reflects the northern lights from the vision of making two stories random, explains the report Visit Finland see the marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main target groups of the Visit Finland Revontuli campaign are the wealthy Japanese women aged 25 to 35, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers at Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has exceptionally strong and positive landscapes among Japanese people compared to other Nordics.
However, the Japanese would like more unique attractions in Finland and, according to Lind, there is a huge potential for these revocules.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists have grown considerably more than other Nordics in Finland.
Last year they spent more than double their night in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finland as a target group for tourism because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain was satisfied in the Rugby-7 silver race when Fidz's master team won the gold
The impressive success of the UK in the Rugby game of seven players was broken as Fidzi won it on Thursday at the Rio Deodoro Stadium final, I numbered 43-7.
Fidzi gave the master's teaching in ball handling, transfers, tributaries, pelt games, runs and raw power and thus won gold – if the country had the first Olympic medal in its history.
The killing meant silver, which was slightly thinner than the British, because it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They could be proud of their success in the Rugby-7 tournament in the Olympics for the first time, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tight victory of South Africa's Boks in the 7th semi-final was likely to have a negative impact on the team on the finals earlier on the same day.
Despite this, Fidz's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-man team had been in full power.
The fact that at least one British player will get his neck tomorrow is the gold medalr, Ben Ryan, former coach of the English Rugby-7 team from Wimbledon, who is from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite great for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss is painful, but progress is shocking.
Fidzi started off excellently and introduced his taclapping skills to Britain as a result of interest.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had hit a bunch of moving buses, and world champions got on 5 to 0 when Osea Kolinisau made a pitch.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai painted another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The situation is between 12 and 0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great hit prevented the shocking Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it didn't slow down Fidz's going for long.
When the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made the goal to the right corner, after which the UK had 17-0 losses.
Nakarawa made another goal for a further start, when there was still more than one minute left in the first half of the game.
After this, Vatemo Ravovuou collided the British team through the even more powerful tabloids and hit the finish line.
After the landing, the opening period ended from 29 to 0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play the Rugby of seven players, while the British were still in the middle of the student's role.
Which is a lot of right.
The United Kingdom made large-scale changes in half time and managed to hold back the Fidzians for a total of four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half of the period until Joshua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team of the Fidzians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation by making the UK a goal to the left, but the game had long since been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang, waving flags and dancing in the audience.
It was difficult not to admire Fidz’s pure joyous attitude.
Mata Vilime finished the scene in the Fidzian cake by making the goal at the last few moments.
The bell rings, the fidzians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
In the previous day, Fidzi had won the Japanese semi-final in the 20th and the United Kingdom had fallen short in a tight semi-final over South Africa, where the UK goal kick was solved.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boks in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his daring footwork and crashed under paint poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Watson, a UK 15 player at the Rugby team, seals the victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This is more emotional than any gold in these races.
From the first draw to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning had a 220 winning bet in history and found a further reference to their golden moment in Estacio da Lago.
Although in the air, they were two, the boat seemed like a third coach Robin Williams's voice, which encouraged them to go out into their second successive Olympics in women's twins, making them the first women in the history of British sports that reach the same achievement.
Their superiority was undisputed, the victory for them was already 39 consecutive times and again recordable.
What we see is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
There is a large number of helpful hands behind each row, each of which has contributed to two peripherys. However, the most important thing for the assistants is a coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at that time.
I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
and it would've been pretty bad.
It's a little different from what you think.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third one was lucky that Williams was able to start treatment outside the season of the species in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little damage as possible if it was possible to say so now in circumstances like this.
I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked all over the department, six, nine and a half feet at a time, when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
It's a trip, but it's made it a little bigger.
Immediately after victory, the thoughts of the twin were at Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more normal when trying to overcome his own unrest.
The British royal artillery captain Stanning, who was behind him for a tour of Afghanistan, says: “I have been in ruins this week, which may be a little extreme, but that means so much...
It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cash have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be much of a thank-you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw a match.
Even at the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and the Danish twins started to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
We were very attached in the moment.
Helen's hot, easy, easy, easy.
It's very important that you don't get off the road.
\"We were very happy to leave, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything wonderful.
We didn't aim for heaven today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did.
The twin will think about a year before he decides on his future.
Next month, Glover celebrates the wedding with a familiar Steve Backshaller on television nature programmes.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
It took about four minutes to understand this time.
This feels so much better, he says.
Iceland is changing the corrupt government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which have already been called for by the protestors who have been pissed off by Panama databases in the spring.
So-called Panama paper revealed tax evasion by a number of Icelandic politicians.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protestors.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannson, promised to organise new parliamentary elections in autumn at that time.
The election has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last year's rage affects the autumn election.
In June the presidential elections saw a clear view of criticism of the captivators, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated for politics from outside.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
The US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cancelled his latest speech.
He said he was sarcastically claiming that President Barack Obama would be the founder and candidate for democracy of the terrorist organization Isis for the establishment of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was angry with what he said, and he insisted on an apology from Trump.
The army chief should never let anyone fall down like that, Clinton's receipt.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the burkin’s bathing suit, which is popular for Muslims, on the bathing beaches, reports, among other things, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that bathing on beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a good manner and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing costumes, which are largely expressing religious ties, can increase the risk of confusion in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove French national day to the party crowd.
At the end of July, two extreme organizations in Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of bathing water in Oulu passed through the wall - Blue samber in the lake Piykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue whiting has been observed on the bathing area of Lake Peykösjärvi.
During the Tuesday and Wednesday period, Oulu’s environmental activities took water samples from nine EU shores and 30 other common bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, all concentrations of E.coli and enterococciforms of bathing waters in bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
Water E.coli and entero-cocaine concentrations were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The surface of the lake of fishing does not yet make the bathing area unsaponifiable, but under favourable conditions the situation may quickly turn into a blue-grain bed, making the surface of the water a blue-green bed of rest on the plateau.
Environmental action follows the situation with increased controls.
If the sinusine seine is transformed into a blue whirlpool, the bathing areas shall also be reported separately on the reporting table.

M.T.M.K.: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest reduction is one tax change in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation of the forest holding.
The Ministry of Finance has four objectives: promoting generation exchanges of forest holdings, increasing the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of the forest holding and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote an entrepreneurial forestry industry.
A hunter would reduce the clean capital result of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generation exchanges of forest holdings is good, commenting to the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK) Director of Forestry Juha Hakkarainen.
It is, however, astounding to find a critical proposal for a tax change.
Forest reduction is set out as a function of the clean capital result of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
In the opinion of the OCT and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales of the tree.
The VM proposal is based on a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry by preventing the loss of the income of forestry, which should be reduced in other taxes.
This kind of person would get tax benefits even if he didn't sell wood.
The model of calculation is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out. Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model applies only to a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit for forest yield is EUR 40 000.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the reduction.
The model would have an impact of around 10% of the forest ownership division, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the holding.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been carried out for decades according to Hajorainen.
Its background is the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MEK, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years, and around half of forest owners are retired.
The powerful rake of rage surprised the motorists in Himanga - two cars were smothered into each other and ran into each other.
Himanga, the Kalajoki River, had a special chase on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two consecutive times were subdued into the stream, after which the car came running after the driver.
According to the sunfriend fireman, Harri Pühtiääää, the defamation of the stream is suspected of having been caused by a powerful rage.
In the back of the car, there were two people who were both transported to hospital.
There's no more accurate knowledge of their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove before was not injured.
The accident occurred on highway 8 Himanga a few kilometers from Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings of Professor Johanna Ivaska's study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the incidence of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as chest tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in this environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by returning the cancer surrounding tissue to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results have been published in Nature Communications on 4 August.
There's no reason why we can't get to the hospital.
The cleaning of the musketeer’s household’s death continues in court for both convicted persons.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for family deaths in Muhoos.
The other received 8 years for 4 months from the killing and gross robbery of, among other things, a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment as a young person for murder and gross robbery.
The victim was also sentenced to a serious risk of road safety as a young person and to the driving of a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who was sentenced to a more severe sentence.
The prosecution calls for a less punished man to be convicted of a murder committed as a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
They were at the time of the act in full understanding
According to the District Court, 17-year-olds killed a man who was a director of the child protection department at the schoolhouse in July of last year.
The 17-year-old intimidation, according to the reasoning of the judgment, attacked a conductor sitting on the couch of the living room.
The director had gotten rid of him and tolerated the young man in his room, when one of the young men hit him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the director was strangled under the chair, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a mental study, both those who were convicted were at the time of the act fully understood.
According to law, young people had planned to leave the family home at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's longest vertebrae, it only grows when it's 156
The world’s longest living spine has been confirmed by the ice shark, reports the research published in the Science magazine.
In northern Atlantic regions such as the floating ice shark around Greenland, the holler can live up to 400 years of age.
The female is only growing at 156.
More than a lifetime of ice sharks, it grows only a centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known for longer than live ice.
Researchers found their age with a radiocarbon drive.
Because of the nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
According to these, researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The parent was estimated to be 392 years of age, although throwing in the direction or maybe even 120 years of age.
Donald Trump as a financial visa - News of the People
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenues of the State would not be received if the change of Donald Trump's company tax is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced especially through the richest tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
I'd miss a huge amount, $1,000 a year.
The higher income tax rate is now 39,6 after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax completely.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of the industry and of running small businesses into bankruptcy.
The end-of-life environmental standards must be made new and energy regulation broken down.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be renegotiated.
It is necessary to appoint management experts instead of bureaucrats.
According to Trump, the trade policy is one of the biggest causes of the US problems.
The free trade agreements would be debunked.
For imports from China, 45% and 35% of Mexico would be depreciated.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America does not have to change the world:
American cars are going to drive in the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to control at sea, American steel to lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released his own programme early Friday in Finland.
Attack wave from the past - News of the people
The sea is arguably milling, but the actual attack wave is in the middle of Madrid's street crop - an accounting with the past can begin.
It is the core of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Travel lovers (2013) was a little fun and a rosk-side satiric comedy, the previous skin where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish tour career.
Equally Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a syndicate love, relationship and family drama with mother and daughter at the center.
The story is a simple one and we'll see a lot of it as a long setback.
Life seems to be modelled for a middle-aged named person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to break down.
In the after-treatments of random encounters, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be surprised to be at all times until the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta once for her adult daughter, who grew up in her life.
He starts from the time before the birth of his daughter, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Juliet’s young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, will rise in the second female main part, from Ommelte to Ommelt (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be considered a rope, but I'd say that time is kind of weird and literal with one-time wipe.
For almodóvar films, often for such a characteristic rapture, humor is a fair distance to Julieta.
It is a well-played, controlled, place in places with good music and a very sad film in which it is made up of ingredients into electricity.
Instead, the Spanish director has the typical visual colour luminosity that is kept and is starting to put a little bit of quiet in his eye more in a pure shape than a functioning dramatic mode of action.
Diseases, deaths, or other sudden loss of consciousness, but the surface remains one Korean.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a nominal person, the costumes vary from one scene to another, and the same applies to shown ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but this is not particularly the case.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has made the script on the basis of the three novels of Alice Munron, a Canadian, awarded by Nobel 2013.
The Novellit has been published in the book Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a little smooth written literature recording.
Materials would have been emotionally more emotionally dramatic, so much bigger things - in particular, pale guilt - thethetics of the film are being dealt with.
Guidance and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Alice Munron.
The main points are Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of film is 12.8.
The government is trying to keep an election trick - Public News
No new cuts will be made, cheap ministers, so that the basic Finns do not collapse in total.
However, operations decided in the spring will be performed at the store.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings that have already been closed are sufficient.
In this way Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) under the budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, since social security cuts were decided already in the spring framework.
Childhood, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
The training surgery is continuing.
Locals haunt
Why are the ministers so hard to stress that no new cuts will be made on these?
Because next year is the year of the election.
Locals will be held in April and will be the most important hot conductor of the parliamentary term, not the galloons.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal outcome that leads to the different directions of the government parties is ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
Gallupid, however, says that the basic Finnish government party is waiting for a waste loss, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new mandates, which next spring will be realised at the cost of influenceing the right government.
The lifeline of the government of three about the same party is in place for the basic Finnish people to stand.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for it made it necessary for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary visit have also come to the surface.
First of all, new cuts are not to be made - the fact that next year they will be made violently and, second, they will try to soften the basic Finnish - waiting blow.
Major surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if Sipila's government is still up.
The government has set the target of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but the Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will add EUR 5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal councils, there are two options for the government.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt is not folded or even slowed.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means new cuts in the budget line for 2017.
The budget would at least strike a balance in 2018 and then in spring, Parliamentary elections will receive what is coming.
With these measures, debt is not folded
It is quite clear that today's measures do not work out, even if Juha Sipilä is trying to bring about a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen at the information meeting of the budget will prove it irresponsibly:
World economy growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. no call-out from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recently risen since the collapse in 2008, except in the context of a temporary recovery policy at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
The current government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, is rising to 70% in the mid-2017 of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery presented by the left was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs approximately EUR 6 billion, which is practically covered by a new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the meeting and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of tasks are wanted for the King
Three out of four consider the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise to be the responsibility of the municipality to be reflected in the study of the KAKS Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also give the individual community responsibility for libraries, culture, citizens’ studies, building supervision, upper secondary school and waste management.
On the other hand, the responsibility of the county is more clearly sought in the form of regional planning, special care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institution care for disabled people.
There is no desire to transfer any tasks under local government responsibility.
The underage driver ran a chase to the end of the drive to run away from the police.
A 16-year-old motorcycle in Joensuu ran away from the police department at Ilomanants Friday night at half an hour.
The police department tried to stop without the lights of the time of the motorcycle, but the young man went to drive the police away from a fair speed.
The back-up continued on the Sonkajaranna road, from which to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran out of the way.
After this, the young man left the runaway, but the faster the police ran into the fugitive.
The driver's blow test showed a 0.75 prom.
He also had no driver's license to drive on a motorcycle.

The elements of a major accident in the air - see the image gallery of the damage to Parafest
The impact current that fell from the parafest festival's tents caused massive damage.
The President of the Parafestyhtition in Joensuu, Mr Piper, estimates that the festival will be economically accessible, and the event can also be held next year.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the Parafest, was performing on the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue on presentations at the City Theatre premises starting at 13 a.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is at the Parafest exhibition 13-15.
The programme shall be organised as planned.
The cleavage flow is generated in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger the descending air flow.
The changes in the state of the water in the water are binding heat, and therefore the descending air cools and speeds towards the ground.
Air science has been reported by the Finnish Air Science Institute that ecclesiastical flows occur in Finland during several summers.
It's hard to predict the route of the currents.
The crash flow hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum at Parafest’s location on Friday afternoon before the five.
Three tents fell, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were mildly injured.
There was one child in the group who was mildly injured in the further treatment.
Air pollution from the ageing Londoners
According to the study, the skin of the Londoners is getting older faster than usual.
Air pollution is the cause of skin ageing.
The British study tells us about Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many Londoners of retirement age is two and a half years older than an age partner living in rural areas.
Skin aged small particles are a very fine dusting level, starting from transport’s fuels.
The same particulates also cause respiratory diseases, to which, according to Evening Standard, nearly 9 500 London people die every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially to the Londoners who walk on their way to the busy streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, by various masks, but it is recommended that regular cleaning be a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed a man standing in front of you.
He had moved stones on his tractor in his yard.

Through Joban, Kataja, and the River Boys, to the U.S. National Team
Anne Jpartner has played almost all the salibandy MM games since 2003.
Now, in Tampere, there are already 6th races, only 2013 between Canada and being better off in North America.
I was working at Turku and playing with that woman's company when I noticed the report.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy national team.
I'm interested and here we are, Jpartneren, 48, says.
The partner was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth City.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, the JPP got to the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, it wasn't like the kind that was played at the SM level.
This was played by the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later in River Boys hockey in the SM series, Jpartner remembers.
The partner played with the university in Salibandy SM series in 1991-92, followed by three times by Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the company's A-girls in the championship.
Women's SM series career peaked in 1995.

Today, the Hasu living in Helsinki is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the viewer this weekend.
I'm sure it's gonna be a great arena for a Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the final home corners, Hasu atmosphere.
The Kouvola region set fire to Hassu's spark sport and gave good lunch to a fine hobby.
There are very good memories of being a child.
When I was 9 years old, I started volleyball in the E-girls of Elimäe's NMKY.
Top of the mind is too big to play shirts, knee protectors in the ankles as well as huge acetocks and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close society where everyone knew each other.
The group's life created an environment that was nice to play in.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate trained us and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
At the time of June, Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural species selection as a counterweight to the inner balloon.
There's been a bit of fun since the 1990s on the other side of the farm.
The action has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour, thinking that one day I'd be there to play.
Now, this dream will come true when Hasu plays on the weekend with Anniina Parkkinen, the tallest hill, together with SM-finals.
The second-ranked dual goal of the tournament after Rigan and Taru Lahti is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack SM gold in the prize locker, Hasu throws dignity at us.
The presence of the weekend in Kouvola may be in front of the last known audience of Hasulle.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected for civil work.
After the Kisakallio tournament, yes, the international career is over.
Otherwise, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon’s Koli bravely went out as an agricultural contractor
Agriculture, as an entrepreneurship, means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an farmer because he also believes in a positive future in the countryside.
A few years ago, Koli and her little brother Valtteri Koli started acting as a successor to their homeroom.
Their father, Mark Koli, helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant taking up the debt and order an increase in the order for bread to come from the agriculture of the hand.
It's been my thing since I was a kid.
I've always been happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think we need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yardboat, and at first the bank was not very excited about it.
I myself, however, was very courageous in the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon’s Koli, and added that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything will be turned to good.
Solomon Kol’s goal of raising meatcars is to invest in its even bigger navet.
The work has resulted, for Solomon’s Koli has been chosen as the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Earth’s Future magazine.
At the same time, he's competing for a win.
He can be put to the vote on the website until 21.8.

Snapchat’s anime efficiency is criticised as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says an anime, which was inspired by the filter, but some observers believe it to be racist.
The Snapchat lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an anaksse, dog, or character in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
The birds are adorned, characteristic distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfie per day.
All the delusions quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have received a criticism of how it has been charged with favoring blackface or bleached skin jackets as a beauty ring.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into vibrations, mistook teeth, and made cheek balls, some of the critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people.
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts referred to the bigger problem that the company had with the difference.
The news and rage spread to a large Wednesday, and they wrote about it, among other things, the Venge and Motherboard day after Snapchat told us that he had removed the filter.
The company explained the following: the lens was meant to honor anime characters, not the caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of them were agitating about anime comparison.
The Korean American art student, Grace Sparapani, whose twins were widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was at least offensive and awkward,
He adds: “It is difficult to deny the parallel of a very tasty Asian career to the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter isn't just a \"yellowface\" but is taken to a debilitating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there is an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience consists of young people who are ethnicly backgrounds more diverse than their parents ’ answers. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more prudence.
“When one of Snapchat’s lens creates a picture that offends the user, this type of thing no longer gets very easily unnoticed, as previously said, ” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu at the interview on Thursday.
As Product Manager and Designer Zhu, working at the Medium Publication Platform, decided on Thursday to remove their Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In his article and phone interviews published by the Media, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in the sampling practices of Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the company for most of the white and only male leaders and decided to write with Hashtag: #DelateSnapchat.
“It is either that there are no people of color in their one-sided staff, when they can make decisions like this, or if they are also colored as workers, but their position is not the way they would dare to express their opinion directly and easily, ” says Zhu, Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures of the ethnic background of its staff, calling for its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but the company has recently hired a recruit to focus on the under-represented groups and the promotion of inclusion within the company.
Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: \"I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK.
According to Congress expert team, military officials have distorted Isis intelligence.
On Thursday, the Congress Expert Group published a report that the US Armed Forces, Central Command officers, changed the intelligence reports to give an optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the field gave rise to a cause for understanding.
The Republican presidents of the National Committee for Foreign Affairs (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group to report on the general dissatisfaction of the armed intelligence analysts. According to the analysts, the senior military authorities were appraised against Isis.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is the United States Armed Forces headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
\"The intelligence reports approved by the Supreme Directors of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism than the facts in the field and were, without exception, more positive than in the analysis of other entities in the intelligence community,\" says the press report.
“The events at Centcom are unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when wrong analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers, ” says Ken Calvert, California Republican representative.
“The errors in Centcom’s management portal go beyond the level of the organisation –
The 10-page report details the continuing problems in 2014 and 2015, which include the Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American activities for the training of Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama's administrative authorities have been forged, it gives an analytical picture of the perception that Centcom's leaders would have pushed them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the reports of the Central Command press releases, statements and statements to Congress were much more positive than the actual events were, ” the report says.
\"As an example, the Centcom official publicly issued a statement saying that a major military attack could already take place in April or May 2015 \"
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Isisi's control.
\"After months of research, this is very clear,\" says Mike Bombeo, republikan rep at Kansas.
\"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. armed intelligence leaders manipulated the intelligence generated to reduce the threat of Isis in Iraq,
The Republicans set up a working group once they knew the analysts had expressed doubts about the manipulation of intelligence data on Isaac.
The report published on Thursday will be accompanied by more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence Inspector has launched an investigation into the intelligence data at Centcom.
On Thursday, the members of the Committee responsible for Deputies of the House published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Party.
“From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an over-restricted process in which intelligence data on Isis and Iraq’s security forces were evaluated, ” says Adam B. Schiff, a high-level representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process was delayed by the publication of intelligence results, a violation of the morals of analysts, and a lack of attention to differing views.
According to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to the pre-defined or political official line.
The news site Daily Beat reported the initial results of the study carried out by the Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported a study by the Pentagon supervisor, which began as a result of the complaints by the Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the inspection is ongoing.
He says, however, that: \"The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security:
The investigation also has other consequences, in addition to its efforts to determine whether the US-led bombings have been successful in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by more than one defence authority).
However, the arguments put forward last year were questionable as to how much President Obama can rely on Central Command and how honest it provides estimates of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the intelligence of individuals corresponds to the differences that occurred more than a decade ago, when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that President George W. Bush's government, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only small troops to Iraq and spent only a little time thinking about what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on Isis intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Task Force concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air blows to the processing plants controlled by Isis had not significantly undermined the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary processing plants and thus managed to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, reported The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, became the target of criticism last year after many legislators had assessed the statements of witness to the Senate as being too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win the fourth duel in women's groundhogs and consolidate its position in the middle of an interdependence with Britain.
After making three goals in the victory, I painted 6 to 6 in a game against Japan Katie Bam made the first two goals for the U.S. women's Earth Hockey country team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he used to succeed in the same way.
I have no idea, he says.
I'm not one of the people who likes to do a lot of painting.
However, he knows: the Americans have won four games in their Olympics and lost zero games and split their first place in their group with Britain, who continued their winnings on Thursday, in Japanese chapters 2 to 0.
Britain and the United States play the opposite on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final match, which will determine which of these six teams will form the first and whichever will be the second.
The first step is to avoid a longer encounter with the Dutch team, which won the second reading.
Despite the fact that on Saturday's game, the Americans have already brought up their surprising success in these races, four years after it was left for the last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the state of Pennsylvania and first grabbed the groundhockey country when he was 3 years old (his older twin sister played the species in Drexel).
The 2008 Olympics missed him when he failed to make it to the final player list.
After this, the 2012 races came where he and his team did not have much success.
The following year, the coach was appointed English Craig Parnham, and then things began to change.
It was cultural, spiritual and physical, says Bam.
Our job in London wasn't the way it is now.
We've made a complete translation.
On Thursday night Bam opened the paint bar in the first half by hitting the ball near the crash.
India had come into the game without any tournament wins, but it proved to be an unexpected hard opponent and maintained the 1-0 situation until the third episode, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left side of the field, rolled into the middle field, hit the ball in the finish line, and thus took the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first tournament in which US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the American goal was sunk each with one hit.
Briggs is now living in a success period,
Just like Bam.
\"Our business is now good,\" says Parnham, \"but how good, it depends on the results of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympics, trampoline brings zen
No matter where and when they're going, they're going to run into the Olympics.
Rio de Janeiro events, competitions and struggles seem to be the next exciting message constantly and everywhere.
Like the Olympics themselves, there would be a flaming signal from the bows to the swimmer, the swimmer to the gymnast and the gymnast to the triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the line of the cafe without ever hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympics' first-time Dooley charm with their smile and might well have a name on all the lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be popular by sponsors and perform a good mind in TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from California Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic gold trampoline.
Olympic fire does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Farer from the center, partly in the shadow are the less well-known sports, such as air pistola ammunta, archery, closed ball and taekwondo.
We'll always have a balconies, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I have permission to write a modest story about my own special favor, I would like to draw attention to the hidden charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since the 2000 Sydney competitions, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so little that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic species.
Ignorance can be regional.
After all, athletes from the United States have been involved in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never reached medals and has never advanced to the finals before 2012.
In the trampoline of men, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the side of women, the men's medalists are Canadians.
The Chinese Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie MacLenna defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the pooler, which is partly because the uncivilized ear sounds more suitable for circus school than the Olympics.
(I know in this connection that I am no expert, just a regular fan.)
The species have a congruent potential that has been used in the drawings in the endless continuous impact of the characters. But it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming jump, i.e. in species that are essentially combined in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, meaning \"pong board\".
The ambitious masters jump with a huge trampoline that will bulge them to a height of nearly 10 metres. Before landing on their feet, the jumpers will have to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as spins, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympics programme, the jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, severity and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes come from 17 different countries, 16 of them and 16 of them.
The most common type of Olympics is straight ahead.
The medals must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the paint line or starting wall, they also have another objective in which they aim for TV broadcasts, namely the world or the Olympics record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and is enough even to receive the tears of the viewer.
But I also think that is a bit exhausting just by watching the race.
This is where the trampoline offers you a break.
Trampolis is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast goes up like an astronaut, falls down and squeals to get back up.
Of course, the species also include a competitive aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush to the goal or to jump far, only a dreamful and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen as only the Olympics can make it.
Women’s carbing matches and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and will start at 13.00 local time and men will answer the race on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of the afternoon's broadcast, which will start on each day at 14.00 local time.
In the midst of Olympia, they bring a calm and wonderful moment, which, in the midst of a common hop, might remain unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes and by the objective – as recently suggested by US male champions Wall Street Journalal – in that case Logan Dooley is waiting for his new fan team to be appalled.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-term ally in the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have been breaking up violently demanding political change across Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protestors have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable African countries and a reliable ally in the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, the country has perpetuated anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to wider areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organisations, the reaction of the government was pathetic.
According to witnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed protestors.
The demonstrations are expected at the end of last year, or in the videos described at the beginning of this year, show how security forces beat young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights official is now in need of in-depth research.
“Keeping the country united has always been difficult and it is even harder to take forward, ” says Rashid Abdi, International Crisis Group Director for the Horn of Africa.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is Africa's second largest country, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The United States Army and intelligence services strongly support the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threat throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only few African countries, if nothing, will receive so much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even new as a gardener.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model of democracy. Human rights organisations have constantly reported government repression policy, opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to show their minds, ” says Seyoum Teshome, who works as a newspaper of the University of Central Ethiopia.
\"All young people show their minds.
The whole generation protests.
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, always land use to the discipline of the government coalition.
The ruling party and its allies after the wide-ranging election of last year received the last place previously held by the opposition, which is why they now rule the whole Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions rise at Eritrea’s border, where the violent situation required hundreds of deaths in the June battle.
Analysts fear that, in recent years, more or less destroyed separatist groups, such as the Oromo release line or the Ogaden national freedom line, may try to exploit confusion and re-arm off.
There are many reasons why a bitter mood that has been on the surface for years now is being decomposed.
The first is obvious innocent, smartphones.
Only in the past few years the Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media when the cheaper smartphones became common and Internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many will, however, be able to access the Internet through brokering servers that hide their location.
Many young Ethiopians reported that this was how they called people into protests.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups of people in Ethiopia, orphans and amphoras.
Oromes and affidavits are not natural allies.
The Africans from high - level Christians, Ethiopia, have long been in control of the country's politics and business, and have been ruining orphans, most of which are Muslims and live in sub-regions.
But it's also changing.
“Cooperative work is getting deeper and we’re getting under the same umbrella, ” says Mulatu Gemechu, director of the Orromo.
The greatest demonstrations have just been in the Orome- and-Amara areas.
Many Amhars and Oromes experience the unfair control of Ethiopia by a tiger tribe, representing only about six per cent of the population, but also controlling the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind restlessness is the death of Meles Zenawin.
Former rebel leader, Meles, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a disease that was not mentioned in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius capable of seeing around the corner.
According to the analysts, he was particularly skilled in identifying the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors who reconciled the opposite’s flashes.
“This essential instinct is missing from the present government, ” says conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, entered the boots of Meles from almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, who was from the northern part of Tigre, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to the analysts, he has no trust in the security forces managed by the tiger tribe.
Many fear this to mean more bloodshed.
For the last time in Ethiopia, similar riots were found in 2005, when thousands expressed their opinion against elections, which, according to government analysts, were first pampered and then stolen.
In post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although the dead were less than in the previous months, and their unrest ceased relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for long-term infrastructure planning, such as a new ground train, and a major step forward in combating poverty.
But an inner grudge against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented power.
And the grudge is about to take dangerous ethnic form.
In the last month, protestors in Gondar, the Amorite City, attacked the companies owned by the tigers, and the hate speech against the tigers is becoming more and more popular in social media.
According to the analysts, protests place the United States and other Western allies in a bad situation.
According to the United States, Ethiopia has been used as a base for unmanned, neighbouring Somalia aircraft, but the base has recently been closed.
At the same time that the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally already in an unstable region to collapse.
This requires tight balance, says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back on Friday in the fight against his latest campaign, claiming that he was not seriously claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were terrorist groups Isis-based.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican candidate’s ability to send a clear message to his country’s citizens.
His supporters, who must try to defend their candidates in these stormy moments and explain the comments he may not have meant.
Trump made a statement at the election held Wednesday night and repeated various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that President Hillary Clinton had created Isis.
In time, however, on Friday morning Trump took out a tweet and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump swung his whole speech in the Twiit the day before, when I said that he had been charged with several interviews completely seriously.
When the radio driver and conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumpic soften their claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down his claim.
The last criticism storm went up when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy when the numbers of suffering fell.
Trump and Clinton had their economic policy lines in Michigan this week.
On Friday Trump tried to get back on the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and considered Clinton's speech boring.
Trump's been defending the sarcasm before.
At the end of July he received extensive criticisms when he called on the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later on, he explained his comments by saying: \"I was sarcastic, of course, too.
In this way Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
“I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees how the supporters respond to messages, and to clarify, then in one way or another depending on the reactions, ” says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by the two presidential candidates.
\"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are circumspect enough to pass through different sides,
Instead of softening the statements of Trump to the election audience, he has changed his style in the last few days even more persistently when his support numbers have continued to fall.
On Friday, a new opinion poll published by NBC, Wall Street Journalal and Marist reported that Trump's support is considerably lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is very smooth.
While Trump usually tries to avoid asking for forgiveness for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics that these misinterpret his words or do not understand his sense of humor.
But after ever more specific observation, the jokes of Trump's presidential campaign have put his loyal supporters in a awkward position, in which they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provosive they are.
One of the most important supporters of Trump, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giulian defended the presidential candidate in a post of CNN's interview on Thursday.
“I think his words were justified, as a political speech, ” replied Giulian, who asked him if Trump was correct when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton had established Isis.
\"It is true that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama called \"the lower set team,\" and that's why he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans representing the current system are trying to argue that the Obama regime, in which Hillary Clinton was Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to continue its efforts when it did not take decisive action in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of taking up his speeches and having a discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked and pathetic, TV programmers trying to find out about him, but he said he couldn't succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said it was only more clear that he was not fit for president.
A coffee shop that stopped opening in GreenPoint because of an excessive rent increase
Verb Cafe was a slightly explosive cafe in Williamsburg, where only a cash machine and no Wi-Fi was available, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe came out of its street range when the rent was disproportionate.
Verb Cafe to be replaced in the summer of 2014 by Soap Cherie sells cake-shaped soaps.
The locals consider this to be a means of degrading to avoid the loss of a coffee shop that has been degraded.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: \"New York changes, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBG club is no longer, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop.
But even though New York is no longer the same, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in GreenPoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and can pay with a credit card, but some of the workers have the same feeling and still feel unprepared.
Coffee is still good, too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When one customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36.
Verb space bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espressophone model.
In addition, it rebooted even the old Verbin lamps.
Rodriguez says that he wanted to try something new, and
added new products to the list.
Bacon egg cheese-sandwiches and stuffed capers and browned onion rings are available.
There are also dark man skins on the list.
There is no more beer in coffee, but instead of fresh fruit juices.
After having held a coffee shop for nine months, Rodriguez says that he noticed that old standard customers began to visit Verb in a steady flow.
“A lot of our old clients got out of Williamsburg, ” she says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited the cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After changing to GreenPoint, he took a walk to the Verbi, which was in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he tells me he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture, he says.
Now he's drinking coffee again on that Sunday, even though he took instead of his usual ice coffee, a chai-calculation, which is also a list of news.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithful to Verb since 2003.
He used to come to the coffee shop before work and order the same thing.
- I walked into a coffee shop every day over seven minutes, like a machine, and there they've already made my furniture with all the fillings, he's telling me.
Photo: Rodriguez wanted to try something new and brought his menu of new products.
Today, Rosenthal continues to produce his standard products, but sometimes he varies from one bagel to the bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says there's no reason why the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to produce a special soap used for the manufacture of Verbin’s own cold coffee.
We'll still be able to take the offer, Rodriguez says.
The Polish people who lived in GreenPinti have also accepted the cafe with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is going to find a suitable place to welcome his new neighbors.
The new place has brought with it other benefits.
Local juice company wants to bottle up and sell the coffee from the coffee shop.
The café may also be extended to a nearby building.
However, many customers have enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client in Williamsburg, and he tells us his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like it was coming home, says Whitt.
- I've known the smell of the coffee shop.
A large depression with a heavy meal in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in his office room in the White House for lunch.
As a culinary president, Roosevelt was pleased with the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose mascara and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: the Devil’s eggs (deviled Eggs) in the tomato sauce, your potato juice and for dessert from the boner.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffer, ” says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband, Andrew Coe, adds: “It was also a message for the Americans, how should they eat?
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights works as both food historians.
Coen's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called '97 Orchard', tells about the story of the apartment in the district of Lower East Side.
Their new joint work is the A Square Meal, published on Tuesday by Harper, which describes the history of American food as the great depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron pilot and opened in the same year as the large stock exchange crash took place in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled Sandwich and 57-year-old Coe in turn turkey, potato cheese and mixed vegetables.
When the journalist ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was suitable for a very large debate on the eating of the sheep season.
- The berries were very popular,\" says Jane Ziegelman.
People ate peanut fractures, liver breakers, and baked beans.
They were made of materials that were cheap and greasy.
Imagine your cancers so much peanuts that they're enough for a full meal.
Andrew Coe's making me feel bad.
It must have weighed like a lead in the stomach, he says.
Before the great lay of the American dining table, especially in the countryside, it was a buffet principle that nights as much as you want.
Women made food for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, for lunch and dinner, they served counter-fed pies.
It was the Americans who had sent food to the Europeans who were starving during World War I that the A Square Meal is a chronicle of ways in which the people survived when all of a sudden annihilation had to be abandoned.
\"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for the Americans,\" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One equally distressing new diet was: according to Ziegelman, the valuable types of food such as dippings and pasta became the main food, and the pasta was said to be a powerful way to use the food stars, because the cooks could hide not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Of the flesh, which had been the main part of the American meal for years, it became austerely used luxury.
Strange blends were tried, with the most important thing about meeting calorie and nutritional values, not so much taste or even a healthy kitchen.
In carrying out a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared ovens filled with peanuts that were used as fast-time food.
\"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table,\" says Coe.
Ziegelman adds: “It was unreal.
Groundnut butter and ants don't fit at all.
This was a characteristic of a lot of household wastes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Office for Households in 1923-1943, directed people’s eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to become precise budget players and to face the challenge of making dusty-cermaspage-like food species.
The book Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavours.
Particularly tasty are the presentations of the reaction of the State Leader to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, that I have to eat cakes.
While he publicly praised his childhood with simple food on a iowalike farm, he himself ate, like a billionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become.
He liked the continental kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce, says Coe.
- He ate almost for the gold-coated dining room, with a tuxedo on his head.
He was completely attracted to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example in his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt was hired, the housekeeper, who was not interested in the taste at all, was serving food in the White House, not only from Washington's boring food, but also from the worst.
Many of the sheep-time food was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food crops and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple are telling the book when they started writing about the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why she could not throw away food.
He was really afraid that the food would have to be thrown away, so say Coe.
People even started getting sick of his food, remembers Ziegelman.
- One example of the windfalls -
When the main food plates were emptyed in Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the broom food they prepared at home, the one that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
“It’s called a bulge, ” says Ziegelman, and adds that giving a prominent name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream cream, just plums, little flour, sugar, water and canal.
We've just, uh... we've just, uh... we've just, uh... we've just, uh... we've just, uh... we've... we've... we've... we've... we've... we've... we've... we've... we've... we've... we've
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe was dancing for the second time and the third.
\"German peanuts would do better than this,\" Coe says to his wife, sounding positive from the budgetary authority.
full compensation to Gilead for the illegality of the hepatitis C medicinal product with Merck
The judge of the United States Court of Justice decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the legal aid granted to it by Merck & Co Inc, a pharmaceutical manufacturer for the patent of a hepatitis C medicinal product.
In June, Gilead was released from damages for 200 million dollars for infringements of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the successful medicinal products named Gilead Sovaldi and Harvin.
In an action registered as Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the United States Court of Justice states that Gilead was entitled to the exemption from the commissions for the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other and called for private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is an active substance for Gilead.
United States-backed troops have taken over the city of Manbij from Isis.
The United States-backed troops have taken over the city of Manjib near the Turkish border in Northern Syria, when the last extreme Isis fighters left the city, reports the troops informant.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now branching the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2 000 hostages taken by Isis fighters had been released.
\"We're in full possession now, but we're still conducting search operations,\" Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton, President-designate of the Democrats, announced his 2015 tax return, indicating that his and his husband's income was at that time $10.75 million and the real federal tax rate they paid was 34.2.
In 2015, Clinton donated a million dollars to charity organizations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton announced that he earned $3 million in Simon & Schuster's book dealing with his term of office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The vice-president of Clinton, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, published ten years of tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
\"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to look as a model for economic transparency,\" says Jennifer Palmier, campaign assistant at Clinton.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
It is common practice that US presidential candidates have always made public their tax information, even though the law does not require them to do so.
Trump, a New York Businessman, and his lawyers, have filed a check on the tax government, and they say that's why Trump hasn't released his income data.
- The transfer is yours, with reference to the tax information of the Democratic candidate, Ian Sams, campaign assistant for Clinton.
Thursday night's special lawyer Michael Cohen told CNN that he wouldn't let Trump publish his tax records until the checks were complete.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information gives rise to questions about Trump's own capital, his grants for charity, his business relations and many other bonds, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has addressed this question and released a video online on Friday, where he will highlight prominent Republicans who will upload Trump to release his tax information.
Mr Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
\"Trump refuses to do what every candidate for President has been doing for decades, and not his public tax returns,\" said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico magazine, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid just a little for two in the 1990s, and the New York Times's business column also quoted several tax agents and auditors on Friday that the situation could continue to be the same.
The federal tax rates have been raised as a key issue for the presidential elections.
Clinton has advocated a billionaire investor, according to Warren Buffett, a rule that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the headquarters of the Berkshire Hathaway multi-company company, challenged Trump's meeting, where they both would disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to tax control and that Trump is not afraid of tax authorities, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns up to 2007.
Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York State, paid an average of 32% of the real federal tax in 2007-2014 and the real combined tax rate they paid was around 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return in 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their incomes were wage subsidies.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and Clinton reported dividends and interest incomes worth $190,000.

Chili powder-filled bulk condoms supported by the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Naturalists in Tanzania have developed an unusual way to keep elephants from living near the human body – elephants are alarmed by throwing chili powder-filled condoms toward them.
The work has proven to be effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, which developed a campaign together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has started to teach volunteers from the villages of northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and cultures without harming elephants.
A little while ago, there were spears used to alarm the elephants.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
\"We have developed a method to change attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can count on them to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,\" says Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intruding elephant is ashamed of showing the flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw a so-called chili cloud.
The soil mixed chili powder is placed in a condom together with a seal, and the head of the condom is then twisted so that only the ignition wire is left out.
When the ignition line is lit, the condom will explode and spread a fine chili powder cloud into the air.
Usually, one spice cloud is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last way to do so is to shoot a giant Roman candle into the air of a famous fireworks and create a loud and clear explosion.
The Jewish cinema director criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's direction number from the Arab framework - RT News
The French, the Jewish film director, gave birth to the media track when he discovered that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel did not mention Israel's direction number in its land number list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, poured out his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
In his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find a hotel in the direction list of Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
\"How is it possible that, in 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it had not existed –
Lanzmann's writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation on the subject at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes the response of the reception officer has upset him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was a decision which was carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski Hotels.
The reason behind the measure was still shocking the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: \"The vast majority of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the removal of Israel's direction number.
The Israeli Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the case was a great disgrace.
- It's shocking and shocking us all.
It's a shame.
And the more disgraceful it is, considering that we are in Germany and that this is the chain of hotels.
That's all we need to explain.
We're waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions,\" says the ambassador.
The case led to quite a counter reaction online, which called it a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the claims of alleged Arabic clients.
\"At the end,\" he said in a publication that revealed the location of the hotel near the synagogue in Kurfurstendamm.
Der Spiegel writes the hotel's mistrusted accusations quickly, called a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
“Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel’s representative was never given orders to leave Israel on the list of direction numbers.
It adds that the heading number has since been added to the list.
The police used cynic gas and rubber cakes in the demonstration of Brazilian students
Students joined the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to show their opinion on government reform of the public education system.
The police used cynic gas and rubber bags against the protesters.
The strike began when law enforcement officials tried to break up the student population, resulting in police using rubber bags and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to demonstrate their shock to government plans took part in the demonstration.
Sao Paulo, Governor Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed austerity measure involving nearly 100 public schools closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the protestors made graffiti on the walls, which temporarily opposed Michel Temer, the president's office.
Only a few days after the streets were filled with protestors in favour of President Dilma Roussef when the Senate voted on this charge, the student’s demonstration took place.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
The annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent since the withdrawal, says Levan Dzhagaryan, Russian Ambassador to Iran.
According to him, Russian companies' interest in business in Iran has increased since the international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
The Commission notes that, in the context of Iran, the new companies are prepared to enter the market, while the new companies are still in a position to maintain their existing relations with Iran.
Of course, further trade growth is one of the priorities for cooperation between countries, says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to USD 856 million.
“In particular, Russian exports to Iran rapidly rose by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to USD 158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, says Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
In last year, about 35,000 visas were granted to Iranian citizens by the Russian foreign representation in Iran, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was also among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia for the first time.
And it is not too bold to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year, he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Scotti Callum Skinner climbed the goal of British winning bike gold
The Scottish Callum Skinner praised the reputation of the men's team prince in Rio's velodom last night, while the British Trio defended the title earned in London 2012.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow played the role of an anchor he inherited from his countryman, Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made a legend proud in thanking him for the goal and catching victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had only settled in the sixth grade of the World Cup in London in March, despite Hoy’s recent career in competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, specialising in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race career also left the hole Kian Emad and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner, Scottish, was a man whom British trainers believed and where they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy and the winner of the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner did the Olympic show in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British Trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was close after his round, but Kenny made the team's leadership, which Skinner maintained.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes could slow down with a larger gear, which enabled Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up.
Hoy followed him as a BBC commentator and reached the views of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the award line.
Skinner, a 23-year-old in Glasgow, says: “I am flattered by the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We did the Olympic show at the final, and we won the world champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After winning in London in 2012 Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on the track deliberately due to a bad departure.
He later withdrew his word, and the British competition partners did not have a complaint.
This time, there were no problems of this kind in the sovereign victory.
Hindes says: “The dream was like London, and all the British flags went down in the audience.
Our teams were united in the last three months.
We've lost so many World Championships that victory at the Olympics seems amazing.
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten radar stars in Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, there will be a successful five-day velodom ahead.
As Kenny has demonstrated in his ability, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy's achievements and wins three Olympic goldes in one of the Olympics.
This would mean an account mapping with six gold medals and one Hopodedal Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was born also on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
In this case, medal aids would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny's going to compete next in the sprint, which will start today and solve in three days.
Yeah, well, that's right. You know, I'm just gonna be happy about this.
The team race is always the best.
You're gonna enjoy winning together with your friends.
It's a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes says, \"If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the value of the knight,
This was the only medal contest today, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doull were the fastest in four men's teams.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, which was made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (cl 22.42) will compete today on the second day of competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
He and the competition actors had a dispute yesterday before the time when the agents invited him to measure his length.
In the same women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald, from Milngavia, reached the world record at 4:13.260.
The British team can now count on its mighty bike team to take responsibility for the Olympic middle stage and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the actual exceptional evidence from the full leadership in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexual and bullying claims, and the closure of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
First night competitions on the velodom show, however, that the British already’s legendary reputation for rising to the top is once again realised at the perfect moment.
The future of Portland's melting plant is at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract.
The future of the aluminium-plating plant in Portland in Victoria and thus the jobs of thousands of employees are at stake when the power company operating electricity at the melting plant told us that one of the owners of the plant is about to break down the supply contract and that all delivery contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the consequence of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to continue the aid for which the plant is maintained.
Fixed 20-year support will cease in November.
The Alcoan Portland factory is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes around 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland is losing money and is in danger of closing their doors.
The measures correspond to the speculation of the factory over the years, which was first caused by the strong Australian dollar and the recent production of the factory.
AGL, which provides electricity to the large aluminium alloy plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it expects the three other owners of the molten plant to terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the works is Alcoa and Alumina joint venture. The Chinese CITIC and Japanese Maruben Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL says that it expects Portland to operate permanently, which means that physical electricity demand from the melting plant continues.
AGL states that contracts are called “protection contracts” which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period for contracts shall be 12 months and shall end in 2017.
“AGL therefore expects contracts to generate income in the years 2017 to 2017, says the power plant.
The potential return effects on AGL from the year 2018 to the year are currently limiting the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in advance for the termination of contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the agreements does not affect the capacity of Alcoa ... to keep the fuser in operation or to secure the electricity supply to the melting plant.
The American company announced that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to enter into force as of November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
In view of the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Earlier this week, the operational director of AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts that, at annual level, Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
“If these factories leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand on the (electricity) market.
As a producer for us, it wouldn't be good news,\" says Mikkelsen.
Kardashiantos TV star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and its fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, the fourth daughter of the mother and manager Kris, 20 posere in the famous September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's commercial film and has played with Milan, Paris and New York fashioners, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
\"Looking at the face of a room full of my most beloved, she had me in tears, Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover picture was followed by a strange (or perhaps only the Kardashiani series-style?), a script written in which all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family appeared (barbills Rob and Caitly and everyone's favorite uncle, the Kardashianit producer Ryan Seacrest) who forgot his sister's cover. The video ended in a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
My plot is cliché, and it is used almost in almost all the birthday periods of the programs (Seacrest says: “Do you think we have forgotten you – as sincerely as the children’s morning-TV cartoons) but Krisin had to get the rest of his daughter to this public in some way.
For the presence of Vogue in the September issue is without doubt the new era of the Kardashians.
Kendal’s isos sister Kim may have arrived before Vogue’s action (it was in Vogue’s case with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is in his own class.
The number of September is Vogue's most sold publication a year.
The number, which resembles fashion material, attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion page on Fashion fell to 615 pages of advertising on the 832 page of the education last year).
It is expected that, in the last two years, the pictures of the magazine will have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Earlier in September, cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more of a model’s work of fame than models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and Dior-manoskavo Jennifer Lawrence was on cover in 2013, and one year later she received the honour of Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he is a group of famous people who work more than a model, he is in pretty good association.
These celebrities are not known to people's relatives, true-TV stars, or today's children, who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be called gifted women, who succeed in the entertainment sector more than others.
Last year, Beyoncce has one of the strongest years of her career, when she published her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of her real-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a tad.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them \"weaks.\"
These emotions have repressed the surface when the news of Jenner's performance on the Vogue deck came out.
However, the continued abuse of integrity seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is a cover image model for Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking in Marc Jacobs' fashion screens.
He's a promotional street for Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he was filming for the LIVE magazine.
And with his leisure time, he's on real TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and her kids.
Legal aid centres turn away 160 000 people per year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable position in the country are removed from the justice centres, and the sector is preparing for the effects that additional cuts in appropriations will already have on the centres at the extreme.
In the state of Queensland, free legal aid and legal service applications are being turned away from five people already three – most of them are older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unwarranted evictions and against similar injustice without resources fighting people.
Public legal aid services, whose work burden is already overburdened, are preparing for additional cuts in the appropriations.
From June of next year, justice centres will be at risk of losing 30% more of federal funding.
James Farrell, Head of Public Legal Aid Centre in Queensland, reports that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Legal Aid Centre (NSO), thousands of people have already been turned away every year.
According to Farrell, if the federal government does not faint, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public justice centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away in their search for the necessary services, ” says Farrell.
The report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without any help.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, so that these financial cuts will be immediately released so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year the State Government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public justice centres and their customers, and the Government of Palaszczuki must invest in this important work.
An action against Donald Trump's campaign was brought against the threat of an employee with a gun
New York: An action against Donald Trump’s campaign was brought when no action of any kind was expected after the campaign’s leader had been told that the North Carolina leader had threatened with a gun in their driving to Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by the former software coach of the state campaign, Vincent Bordi, on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte.
For months, he says that he expected the situation to be dealt with within the campaign before he realized, according to his own words, that this would not happen.
And then, when he complained about the campaign manager, Earl Phillip put out the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pressed the pipe to Vincent's kneecap.
According to the complaint, after having filed a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, the Bordi was informed that at least four other persons had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
Even if the gun doesn't fire, it'll cause damage,\" says Brenda when he comes in.
The application will only be for two days after the Republican presidential candidate gave rise to a general rage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that the supporters of the second additional position can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and is allowed to elect judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media removed his word from his context, and Trump did not encourage violence in his words.
When it comes to the campaign, he calls for compensation for indifference and for assault, assault and mental suffering caused by the campaign.
The Trump informant Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the message in which he was asked for a comment.
Phillip wasn't targeted despite his attempts.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, told Phillip about his recent campaign.
No immediate response was received to Phillip's consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign.

Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local and London, but in the whole country.
For myself, this was the one that most interested in Heathrow, as we in the London Olympics in 2012, made a huge effort to benefit our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new places of learning and 40 000 new jobs, which eliminates youth unemployment in the near areas of the airport.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who believe that the expansion of Heathrow is too great a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I was told that Britain would never be ready for them and that we would face a awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
The obstacles that can be overcome will always be answered, but Heathrow will answer every question that has been asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many instead of a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by 211 billion pounds, bringing skills and employment to both the airport's environment and the UK as a whole.
At Heathrow we have a great task force that has implemented and remained in the budget for 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment programme, which included the T5 terminal – which has been put to the vote for the best flight terminal of the year in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two world’s most congested runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway with a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Government of Heathrow and former Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertising advice in cat mouse play
An attempt by companies that earn their money on online advertising to mislead advertising barriers software has become cat and mouse, says one company producing prevention programmes.
Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that they would block advertising barriers, Adblock Plus published a blog writing where it reported that users could update their blocking software filters and thus re-enact the advertising of the community service.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change its desktop website's advertising labelling codes so that advertising programs are more difficult to identify which pages are advertising.
But now Adblock tells me that he's been checking out the new codes.
Adblock's informant Ben Williams wrote in his blog writing that \"this kind of football between an open-source advertising community and evaporators has been running ever since the introduction of a promotional practice\" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair business again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has participated in the fight is a strong indication of the concern that advertising professionals have formed in the sector.
It is estimated that 200 million people use advertising promotional programs worldwide, reports a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year.
Facebook is used on a daily basis by mobile devices 1,03 million active users, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading advertising programmes in its desktop application, as according to the data provider, mobile image prevention programs are not working on Facebook mobile applications and Instagram.
The income from Desktop advertising is still high enough and therefore Facebook considered it worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that it would update the user settings advertising tool so that users can control more how ads are allocated to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock's new filters, as it also prevents some of the usual Facebook records from being visible.
\"This is not a good experience for users and we are going to solve the problem,\" said the Facebook journalist in his e-mail.
The advertising programmes are clumsy and ineffective, and we have instead invested in developing user regulations such as advertising tools so that people can control the allocation of advertising themselves.
A woman committed suicide by leaving under cars on a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of witnesses on the highway during the first hours of Thursday for an accident that was deliberately left under more cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud's canal near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate act by laying on the dark road, and more cars hit her, reports Vaud's police report.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her attempt was clearly to commit suicide. Among the overrun cars was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have yet to be identified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in Le Tribune de Geneve that criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether charges are being brought against the drivers involved in the accident.
- Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It's left to the D.A. to find out, says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases, which show that carers are not considered to be responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases the person walked on a dark freeway and the court decided that the drivers could not expect to run into his pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police was released from the prosecution that had been brought up against him after he colluded with a man who lay on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one of the nights of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had been enjoying plenty of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police, which was about to respond to the emergency call, were justified and that the man lying on the road was, in full, an exceptional and unpredictable situation.
Any accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus’s past with the same tools and algorithms as climate researchers use.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions in Venus could have been similar to those on earth at times, even though Venus is hot and waterless and almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to researchers' previous presentations, Venus's slow rotation rate is explained in its thick atmosphere.
On the basis of the latest simulation, however, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to that of the earth and has, nevertheless, been running slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
“In the modeling of GISS Venus is running slowly, and its side is almost two months per sun at a time, ” says the GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like a umbrella and protects the surface from a large proportion of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model created the story of Venus, which corresponds to previous assumptions made by planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans faded, and the ultrasound burned the steamed water.
As the hydrogen left in space, there was only a thick, carbon dioxide gas and a deadly greenhouse effect – i.e. Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus air design in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's giving up as the Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and as Vice-President of the Society's hockey activities, calling for a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Deputy Director-General of Colorado, confirmed the news and announced that the association will immediately begin to seek a new coach.
“For the last three years, I have been the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and the company’s ice-cracking Vice President with a strong, passionate and determined view, ” says Roy, who is 50 years old in his communication.
In the summer, I have considered how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of the Coach and the Society for the hockey operation must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
At the moment, these conditions are not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
\"Patrick told me he made his decision today,\" says Sakic.
\"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him every good thing for the future.\"
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league year in his first season as Avalanche’s head coach 2013-2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost its way to Minnesota in the playoffs and hasn't been in for the next two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the period 2015-2016 and remained five points at the end of the second Wild Card game in Minnesota.
Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in the Montreal Canadiens lines and two in the Avalanche lines.
North Sea oil workers enter into negotiations and suspend the strike
Main advisors say that the North Sea oil pay laws will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil-field services, has been subject to strike by drilling trucks owned by Royal Dutch Shell, located in the North Sea.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties -Wood Group and the Trade Unions Unit and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reinstate the process in order to resolve the dispute -
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding a number of day-to-day meetings all-day in which we will deal with problems from fresh points of view.
Trade unions have justified their recent activities, which they claim to have been the first more than 25 years, as a protest to possible pay cuts of up to 30%.
Because of the negative market pressure, Wood Group is cutting tariffs for its contractors operating in the North Sea this year by around 9%.
The company's tariffs are reduced by 10% in 20114 of the prices of contractors working in the country.
According to the company, further cuts give it the space needed to cope with the decline in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut off thousands of workers from its list of wages and announced its plans to leave oil and gas extraction activities in up to 10 countries, thereby seeking to enhance its operations after its merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the decision taken by the UK in June to leave the European Union will create pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, from Scotland, met with the Labour Leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work reports that have been experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
\"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need a economy that is of interest to many, not just a few,\" Anderson says.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be worth less than USD 1.4 billion in 2016, while around $7 billion has been spent on them in the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Plejad's star range
The last task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotation speed of the stars, which has helped astronoms to gather the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of the stars belonging to the Plejads force so far.
Based on new data, astronomy is able to determine why the stars of the same starship are spinning at different speeds and how the orbits are connected to the planet’s formation.
“We hope that, by comparing the results with the other force, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even the history of its solar system, ” says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the University of Caltech, Pasadena, Research Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis in the press release.
The Plejajad Starship is located 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are about to reach their adult age.
They're spinning faster than ever at the moment.
With the speed of rotation at the top of the adult stars, large amounts of star wind will be decomposed.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's speed of rotation by following the time between the appearance of identifiable star clouds (corresponding to sunlight).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggest that larger stars spin slower than smaller stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers – larger people spin slower than the smaller ones.
\"We see the Plejajad dance that the slow spins are typically bigger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars,\" says Rebull.
Since the Plejads Starship is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory that allows the characteristics of the stars to be compared to the speeds of rotation.
“The series of games offers support pillars for the theoretical models of both younger and older stars, ” Rebull says.
We want to get more information on how, when and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and stop dancing.
Rebull and his colleagues present their most recent analysis of Plejad's rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal.
