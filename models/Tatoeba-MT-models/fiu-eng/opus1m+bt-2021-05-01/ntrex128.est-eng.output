Members of the Wales National Assembly fear that they look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have cooled down the recommendation to turn their title into MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, a member of the Wales Parliament).
It has begun to turn the name of the National Assembly into a Parliament in Wales.
The representatives of all political developments at the National Assembly are concerned that this may lead to ridicule.
One member of the National Assembly of Laborists said that his groupmates are concerned because it is torn down by the words \"Twp and Pwp\".
To explain to readers outside Wales: \"daft\" means \"daft\" and \"pwp\" means \"kkat\".
A member of the platform said that the whole group was “not happy ” and that other names had been offered.
A member of the Conservative Party in Wales said that his group views the name change “observiously, ” but noted that the word ‘MWP’ is very similar to the word ‘Muppet’.
To clarify: in the speech of star w, star w is similar to that of Yorkshire English.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing a draft law on the amendment of the name, said: “The final decision on all the names with which the members of the National Assembly are invited will of course be taken by the members themselves.
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals for the name, on the basis of which the idea of redrafting the National Assembly into the Wales Parliament is widely supported.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the term \"WMP\", but the most favoured option \"MWP\" was given by the public polling participants.
Members of the Assembly are likely to present other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should present a bill on amendments in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also covers other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the comitology system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall remain at the hearing of the members.
Macedonians are holding a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to call their country \"The Republic of Macedonia\".
The referendum will be organised with a view to resolving the dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province, Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour's name represents a requirement for this territory and has repeatedly raised objections to the application for membership of the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia against the referendum on roll-call change, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, those in favour of referendums, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the name change is only the price that the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's watches remain silent because the churches in Harlem are in trouble
“An older person I have spoken to has said that there was a bar and a church on every corner of the day, ” said Mr Adams.
\"Most of them are neither,\"
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“ People today communicate differently, ” he said.
“The bars are no longer the neighborhood’s living rooms, where people spend every day, ”
As far as churches are concerned, however, he is concerned that the money that comes from selling the assets will not continue for as long as the managers hope, and “more or later they will be back at the beginning...
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment houses with apartments full of people who do not give help to the rest of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white, ” he added, “who therefore speed up the day of their arrival when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches will become members of them ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a Black Metropol , the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the St. Martin Church ten years later.
The initial White Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
The Black congregation, who had worshiped God so far, took over the property rights of the building.
The Afro-American Church of St. Martin’s Church presided with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against the 125th Street stores on the main theme of Harlem when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged, but when the members of the family of Father Johnson were planning to restore the building, they introduced a karyllion, or watch game.
Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly named the Caribbean as “the clocks of the poor, ”
The expert who played the career in July gave it the second name: “Culture value – and an irreplaceable historical tool”
The expert at Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that it was the world's first career played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a bigger career 18 years ago in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that the St. Martin Church did not replace him.
The story of architects and contractors who have been involved in the church’s secular leaders, other bishops has been played in St. Martin’s Church in recent months.
The governing body of the church, which was composed of secular leaders, was deaf in July to the bishop’s household in writing that the bishop ‘ tried to pass on the costs, even though the bishop’s group was not even involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some members of the company complained about the poor transparency of the bishop’s actions.
In California, the shark injured the 13-year-old lobster-sucking boy.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was suffocated in California on the day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB TV that he had been in divestment with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy's arm and then swimming with others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel stated that he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for gaining a lobster, but “he then realized that the boy shouted“ I was bitten!
I was bitten.
The whole of his collar had been torn to pieces, “split Hammel’s view of what he saw when he arrived at the boy.
“I asked everyone to come out of the water: ‘ There is sharks in the water, ’ he added.
In a life-threatening position, the boy was taken by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of the shark that has been attacked is still unknown.
At the press conference, the savior and Captain Larry Giles said that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but then it was established that this was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of his body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes from Casablanca to Swamin.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury is planning to take power on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarkets for beauty products, where experts also work.
As part of the significant invasion of the UK market of GBP 2.7 billion in beauty, which continues to be on the rise in the sales of fashion and home goods, the wider lines of beauty products will be tested across 11 countries, taking them into use next year also in other shops.
It is invested in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the previously allocated shelf space for televisions, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said that he was planning to double the range of his beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time the trademarks like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product options from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space in branded areas such as those currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-market its makeup series Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for Vegan because young buyers are demanding more and more.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is testing its exclusive sales license in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will be opened this year in Shelly Oaks, Birmingham.
Buying online and moving to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local food stores means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, has said that outlets are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to fight cheap sales chains like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's put Argos in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitats's sales because Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food goods and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier Supermarket attempt to upgrade its beauty and treatment departments to a failure.
Sainsbury tried to join Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with a line on how to share the income from the sale of supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's sales of its 281 son's pharmaceutical business for three years were worth GBP 125 million from Celesio, which includes the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds, adding to its four shop’s product range luxury skin care products, including trademarks such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s business manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty product exchanges to improve the environment around our customers.
We have also spent money on special training for workers who are always willing to advise.
Our brand choice is in line with all the needs. An attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competitive destination for fair trade, which may change the old ways of shopping –
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million dollars in the deal.
The Dragons Den Star Peter Jones left at “maritime ” when Holly Willoughby, the TV director, gave up 11 million pounds of trade in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for home goods and clothing trademark Truly.
A couple of businesses are compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old TV show, This Morning leader, announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Deni star Peter Jones angry, leaving their luxury lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said that Jones was “serious ” when a TV star girl admitted at a intense meeting that took place in Marlows Buckinghamshire on Tuesday’s business empire headquarters that his new contracts worth GBP 1.5 million meant that she no longer had enough time to devote herself to the trademark of clothing and clothing.
The business is compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and it was thought to double Willoughby's estimated worth of $11 million.
When a 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for a vacation home.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main priority.
It was supposed to secure his far-reaching future, so she thought she was dealing with it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left all the concerned completely astonished.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday because it was so close to placing a series of products on the market.
There is a warehouse in Marlow headquarters full of ready-to-sale goods.
The experts believe that the loss of one of the most paid fames in Great Britain can cost the company millions of dollars, since the choice of products ranging from divan batteries and candles to clothing and home clothing has been invested in a cheap amount of money, which may also lead to a later placing the product on the market.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as president in March.
Couples travel together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes an M&S brander and he's changing from Ant McPartlin to I'm A Celebrity.
One of Jones’ close sources said last night: “I don’t want to comment on his business.
It's a tough talk, after what we fell in love with.
Trump was making fun of criticism, which was aimed at the news about his comment on what some would consider “the President to be worthy ” and excessive positivity to the North Korean Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said his atrocities “with the voice of the new bull, ”
\"I haven't given up anything...
He noted that Kim was after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the withdrawal of North Korea's nuclear weapons, interested in the second meeting.
However, the negotiations on non-nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a corresponding response to the original pollution steps in North Korea.
He pointed out that the US will continue with further pressure on the country.
The point of view of the drumming call was much more vibrant.
“We’re going very well with North Korea, ” he said.
“A war started with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now it's all very well between us,
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced good results: have completed missile attempts, have been helped to release hostages and have been organised to bring American servants' remains home.
He also protected his unusual communication with Kim.
“It’s very simple to be present, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get to that full-stop stage, it’s better than nearly 200 people here, ” Trump said, pointing out the crowd he’s standing in front of us.
The tsunami and earthquake will destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people.
When the consequences of the Lombok earthquake were eliminated, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the people in Lombok had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared a prerequisite for international aid.
“Also they have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international aid, so the stories are a little complicated, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the organisation Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in prayer to decide whether to allow international authorities to contribute to the aid.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural resources.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh for tsunamis, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although there was a warning about the tsunami, the apparent absence of the tsunami siren increased the number of people likely killed.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging at the best.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult there.
In Lomboki, the hospital ship that stops to cure the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it takes at least three days to get to the new site.
President Joko Widodo turned Indonesia into a central part of his election campaign to improve divided infrastructure and has distributed money on roads and railways.
The budget deficits, however, threaten Mr Joko's government as the new elections will be held next year.
Mr Joko has also been pressured by the tensions in Indonesia, among those of the deceased, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to the old-fashioned form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fights between their Christian and Muslim forces in the streets, where the machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons were used.
View: The Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hits the Viking Gate game against Chelsea

The ball flew high over the penalty zone and hit the upper right corner of the net.
It fell over with the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get a position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win for myself as much time as possible, ” said Sturridge page LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come, made a touch, and gave me a blow without thinking, ” he said.
At the end of the first half of the year , Chelsea 1 : 0 led thanks to the goal struck by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before he turned around at the center field and hit Liverpool.
Kovacic gave me a quick eat at the center of the field.
Then he created a beautiful air raid leading Hazard into the penitentiary.
Hazard got through the defense and hit the net with the left foot of the ball from the Liverpool player Alison Becker, in the direction of a mail station far further away.
Liverpool plays with Naples Masters League in Italy on Wednesday at 15.00 Stadio San Paolol in Naples.
Chelsea is faced with Videoton in the UEFA Euroli game on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of people killed in the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832.

The hulk people were trapped on Friday and the 18-metre giants were brought together under the carvings of buildings which had collapsed due to the 7.5- Magnitous earthquake, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke at the press conference of the agency.

The police spokesperson confirmed that a woman found in a building was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged friends of the woman came to the scene, asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said they'd inform the woman's close relatives at the moment.

The shape of Parliament Cromwell is the last monument that is “the cause of history's rewritling.
To eliminate it would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style by male inhuman followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crik's recommendation as a stupidity and attempt to redefine history.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s company, said: “In the debate on the removal of images, it was impossible to keep Oliver Cromwell’s memory mark in front of Westminster’s palace.
Cromwell did not rob images of the English civil war itself and did not tell others to do so.
Maybe they sacrificed the wrong Cromwell man for the work of the century before his ancestors Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent Cromwell presentation is proof of the opinion of the 19th century, and part of the history description of the person to whom a number of people believe should still show respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Most people thought that at the end of the 19th century, rather than today, the Cromwell Parliament’s protector was under external pressure and, in this case, of course, for the royal authority.
Whether this is accurate is an infinite historical dispute.
It is certain that in the middle of the 17th century the fight has shaped the further development of our people and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as the Lord’s Defender deserve also to be celebrated and commemorated.
A Chinese farmer was stabbed to death by a killer.
According to local media records, in Southeast China, a farmer who killed a man was attacked by a farmer.
A man who was identified solely by his last name Yuan found a injured artery dead and covered in blood from a mass of near the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou reported the South China newspaper \"Morning Post\" on Sunday.
Seakeeper manufacturing in Xiningis Qinghai province of China on 30 May 2005 for vaccination of pigs at its table.
On Wednesday he had come from the neighbouring province of Yunnan with his cousin to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the man's cousin found him dead and discovered that the accompanying crowd was open.
He said that there was a big, bloody mouth in the cluster.
The inquiry confirmed that 249,47 kilograms of Ori was reported to have stricken the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were completely bloody and smothered, ” reported Guiyang Evening News, the victim’s cousin Wu’s words.
The security footage showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:00 a.m. to feed his pig.
His body was found nearly an hour later.
The animal who killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he wouldn't be able to attack anyone until the police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are supposed to discuss the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although few, it has been observed before that pigs attack people.
In 2016, a pig woman and her husband were attacked in their Massachusetts farm, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, the pig weighing 294,83 kilograms nailed to the tractor of the farmer in Wales until his wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, when a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs, one of the Manitoba farmers told CBC News that the pigs would normally not attack, but because of the taste of blood, they could walk away in their heads.
“They’re just playful.
They're very curious marakrats, whose aim is not to hurt.
They just need to be respected enough,\" said the man.
Orcan Rosa's after-winds bring massive rainfalls in the southwest of the United States of America
According to forecasts, the Orcan Rosa is weakening, moving across Mexico towards the cooler waters of the north coast.
Still, Rosa will bring floodings to North Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the near future.
On Sunday morning at 05:00, after the time of the east coast, Rosa was classified as the first category of orange with wind blows of 136,78 km per hour, reaching 619,59 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa's supposed to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure will begin to form over the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baya California peninsula on Monday, it will start to channel a deep tropical humidity towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 cents of rain.
The tropical humidity that reacts to the approaching low pressure will then create a large number of strong rainlights in the southwest of the country in the coming days.
At times, between 2.54 and 10,16 centimetres are caused by dangerous storms, flood water, and possible painted deserts.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall between five and seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to include between 5,08 and 10,16 centimetres in certain southeastern parts of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Acute is possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly worsening conditions.
Certainly it should not move in the desert if there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Strong rain may cause the canyons to become fast-flowing rivers and storm storms at times with bursting winds and flying dust.
At times, the approaching low pressure leads to acute rainfalls in the coastal regions of southern California.
The total amount of rainfall is possible, which reaches more than 1,27 centimetres and can cause lower flood water and libedid roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region.
The reduced tropical rainlights will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday morning, rainfalls will become extensive on Monday night and Tuesday.
Strong rainfalls reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, high temperature fluctuations are predicted in the USA due to Arctic cooling, while temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
Sometimes it will result in major temperature changes in small areas.

The temperature differences between Kansas City and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range to almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, you will try to recover a long summer heat.
A large part of the central and eastern United States of America is expected to begin in October with a large amount of temperatures that remain around 80 sodas from the south to the north of the north of the north to the north of the country.
In New York, 26.6 warm teacrates are expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.

Brett Kavanaugh's trial looked at over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, through six television channels, the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the confessions of Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed to have been accused of sexual violence in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political impasse continued, where broadcasting organisations interrupted the last minute of Friday's tours to reflect the usual broadcasts: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drew up a contract with the FBI to conduct a one-week prosecution investigation.
Ford told the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh scratched him with drunk head and tried to tear off her clothes at the high school prom.
Kavanaugh said in his church confession that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's report, over 20.4 million people were likely to be visited on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing them, including PBS, C-SpAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems in calculating the number of people who are looking at transfers within the authorities.
In comparison, it is about as great a audience as football in the final tournament games or sharing Oscars.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a full-day session, said Nielsen.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, remained on the other side.
CBS had 3,1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million and CNN had 2,52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
The interest remained great even after the trial.
Flake was the central character of a Friday drama.
After a statement from the moderate Republican Bureau that he was voting for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS' cameras caught a man on Friday morning when he had fallen down to the protestor's screen, trying to go to the Justice Committee session with the elevator.
He stood in the ground for several minutes when he was accused and transferred directly to CNN.
“I stand right here, in front of you, ” said a woman.
“Do you think he’ll tell the state the truth ”
He was told: “You have power, while as many women as they are completely powerless, ”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and added before closing the elevator that he had more to say at the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks represented a direct transmission several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to forward Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said that he was only doing this in an understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake had a partial conversation with a friend of the Democratic Senate Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had an impact, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not be able to meet the votes of Kavanaugh without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation on Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit of critics in a political game

“ This is something you keep worrying about, ” Wade said.
Vulkan's gonna burst ash over Mexico City.
The whirlwind of a volcano called Popocateptel has reached the southernmost parts of the city of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned the Mexicans on Saturday, telling them to stay away from the volcano because the crate started again an activity which resulted in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash being recorded in 24 hours.
The center was on a series of noises and colorings.
The pictures distributed in social media represented the front of a ash - covered car in various parts of Mexico City, for example in Xochimilco.

The police have collisions with the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona following the conflict of independenceists with the rebel police. Thousands joined the anti-circumvention demonstrations to celebrate the anti-Cathlonian vote on dismissal.
A group of disguising combatants, who were held back by the rebel police, attacked the latter with eggs and powder, creating dust cloud on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Lysylus also occurred later when the police had to use noodles to check the fights.
For several hours, “No obsessiveness, no forgiveness, ” sang the advocates of independence to collide with the state’s unity-friendly protesters who cried, “Long Spain. ”
According to the local press, 14 persons who had been harmed in their statements received medical attention.
The tensions will remain up in the region supporting independence even one year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but still marked by the Catalans.
The voters decided overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although electoral activity was low because those who were opposed to the discharge ignored the vote in large numbers.
According to the Catalan authorities, during the last year, nearly 1,000 people were injured when the police tried to stop the vote in front of the entire region's voting stations, which led to violent collisions.
Independence advocates had stayed in front of the voting stations on Friday nights, in order to avoid supporting statements by the national police.
However, these comments were made but had to take the other way.
Narcis Termes, working as a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in a demonstration that was in favour of separation with his wife, said that he had no hope of seeing Catalan as independent.
“ Last year one of the best moments of our lives took place.
I saw my parents cry for a chance to vote, but now we're stuck, ” he said.
Despite the significant but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting Catalan independence to retain their duty this year, as many of the best-known leaders have either gone to exile or have been held up and waiting to judge their part in organising a referendum and subsequently declare their independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who records a demonstration to support the police on his mobile phone, said that there was a fight between politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more intense, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans, who has been in the Pre-investigation Prison since last year, announced that he will be attending the elections to the European Parliament next year.
“Employment in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the pressure of the Spanish Government, ” he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car was rammed into the house.
Three men of age 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being framed in Londonderry on multiple occasions.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gate and building.
It could also have been set at some point in the direction of the car.
The power blow will give Livingston 1-0 victory in front of the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal was to win for Livingston
The awarded Livingston Open Rangers to take Steven Gerrard to another loss during 18 games when the man has been a manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Menga hit proved to be decisive when Gary Holt raised his level in seconds to Hibernia.
Gerrard will remain in the first league of strangers during this season and will be facing the next Sunday with the leading Hearts, who will be on the ground with eight points.
Before that, the Rangers host Rapid Exports on Thursday in Euroliga.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his undefeated attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston loses the opportunity of a bunch of visitors
Holt's team should have been in charge long before they hit the gate, since their immediate play style caused Rangers any kind of problem.
Scott Robinson broke through protection, but his efforts raged in front of the gate where Alan Lithgow made efforts to catch Craig Halket's headband across the gate.
The hostess allowed the Rangers to play in front of themselves, knowing that they could create problems for the guests in certain places.
And that's also the way they hit the determining gate.
The Rangers set up a break-off and Livingston had an opportunity to play with Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Men, who took the ball, and then managed to get it from the middle of the penalty zone.
By this time the Rangers mainly held the ball, but failed to penetrate the defense, making the goal guard on Liam Kelly's side everyone was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend the gate.
The Rangers Gateguard Allan McGregor was repulsed by Scott Pittman and Lithgow shined brightly in the second team work of Livingston.
The impact was constantly reached in the Livingston Penitentiary, and it was consistently knocked off, and two of them were also directed away, one of them for the attempt to replace the Halketti Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with their hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland in Alaskar Lamont Tony Macaroon
Phenomenal performance and outcome from Livingston.
Each player was great, crossing the ladder upwards in full expectations.
Their gamestyle and players have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt needs to be respected for how he has been punishing the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was huge, organising excellently organized protection while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralli on the back legs during the whole game.
The Rangers had no inspiration.
Regardless of their in-between good quality under the direction of Gerrard, it remained limited in line with the example here.
Their last holding of the ball proved to be incomplete: there was only one time that could function as a alarm clock for the Rangers in the centre of the table.
Contradictory reception of Erdogan in Cologne
In Berlin, on Saturday (29 September) there were both smiles and a cloud of anxiety when the Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been set aside on issues relating to human rights, freedom of press and accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan Kölni went to open a new giant mashee.
The largest Turkish community in the city is outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting 25 000 members from gathering in front of the Moshe, but a number of supporters appeared close to seeing their President.
Hundreds of people against Erdogan, a large part of whom are deaf, also made their voice heard, condemned Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German Government to host the Turkish President in their country.
The fighting demonstrations show that the attitude toward the guest is divided: a Turkish resident in Germany greets him as a hero, while others despise him as a ruler.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: A bicycle driver was killed by car as a result of an accident
In London, a bicycler hit by a car was killed.
The crash took place on a fast road near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, south-east of the city at around 10:15 p.m. after the British summer season.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to provide ambulance doctors, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place a few months after the other biker was killed nearly two kilometers from the Saturday accident site on Childers Street, where the driver who ran off the bike ran away from the scene.
The London police said that the authorities are involved in identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
It is recommended that traffic is closed at the scene and the buses are redirected, that the drivers of motor vehicles avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials injured in unrest
The prison office reported that six prison officials were injured in a very secure peace situation in the men prison.
The peace broke out in his Majesty's Long Lartin prison at Worcestershire Sunday at 09:30 p.m., after the British summer season, and has not yet ended.
A single wing of unrest associated with eight prisoners is involved in the handling of the experts' rebel police.
Prison officials were treated with lighter facial injuries at the scene.
The prison pressman said: “A special training prison staff has been invited to resolve an ongoing case in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, they will be handed over to the police, and their imprisonment may be extended:
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was informed that he was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, however, the rebel police were invited to prison to silence serious unrest during which prison officials were attacked with pilot bullets.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden storms (for areas of origin can be useful)
The tropical low pressure does not hit Arizona often, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, when the ravaged orcan Rosa moves across the eastern desert of the United States, bringing the sudden risk.
The National Weather Service has already carried out sudden surveillance on Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegase and Salt Lake City.
According to the prophecy, Rosa is heading directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region on Monday with rainfalls.
Phoenix’s National Weather Service (ATM) is that, from 1950 onwards, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or a low pressure level within a radius of 32,86 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orcan that passed 64,37 kilometers from the Arizona border,
The latest models of the National Orange Centre predict rainfalls from 5,08 to 10,16 centimetres, which may extend to the restricted areas of Arizona's Mogollon Rim up to 15,24 centimetre.
In other desert regions of the United States, including the central part of the Rock Mountains and the Great Seas are likely to have a rainfall of 2,54 to 5,08 centimetres, extending to 10,16 centimetres in restricted areas.
Rosa's rainfalls may be a blessing to the emerging areas, as the region is in trouble in the drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfalls are also likely to be beneficial, as droughts exist in South America.
According to the U.S. branch monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, i.e. in another category, reported Weather.com.
First, Rosa Baja California's peninsula crosses the coast of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still on the Sunday morning with the largest windmills at Orcan level 6,43 km per hour, is now 619,95 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19,31 km per hour north.
The storm is in contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific, and therefore it is a little bit subdued.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will reach the land of Mexico with the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rainfalls in certain Mexican regions may be high, bringing a significant risk of floods.
“Baja from California to Sonora’s Northwest is expected to have rainforests of 7,62 to 15,24 centimetres ranging from 25,4 centimetres to 25,4 centimetres, ” informed Weather.com.
Then Rosa's heading north of the Mexican tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure group moving across Arizona and reaching the Utah south on Tuesday night.
“The risk following Rosa or its symptoms is very strong rainfalls in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the desert of the southwest of the United States, ” said the National Orange Centre.
These rainlights can cause life-threatening shocks and flooding in the deserts and picturesque mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests related to attempted murder
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British summertime.
The victim was moved to a hospital in stable condition.

Officials are asking to contact anyone who might have a mobile phone record from the case.
Trump said Kavanaugh was carrying a democratic party under evil and anger.
“The support of President Kavanaugh is a voice against the unfettered and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party, ” said Trump in his cheering speech in Wheelingus West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was carrying out a process of appointing a Democratic Party under the rule of law and hatred.
Kavanaugh gave testimony to Congress on Thursday, putting Christine Blasey Ford back on charges that he attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
He also gave a witness at the hearing about his accusations for Ford.
On Saturday, the president said that “Americans saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day ”
The vote given to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to appoint one of the most esteemed legislators of our time who have an impeccable background in public service, he said to the support group in Western Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the electoral activity of the Republic in the intermediate elections.
“A week has remained one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running for it, but I'm actually running for it, he said.
\"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for excellent candidates,
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission aimed at \"suspecting and preventing\"
The first main procedural vote on the Senate's floor on Kavanaugh's application is expected to take place no later than Friday, said the senior assistant of the Republican Party leaders to CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of people killed is rising.
At least 384 people were killed and many threatened when the giants attacked the beach after the strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when the waves of six feet [6 m] hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that remained on the road.
Csunami followed 7.5 magnetic earthquakes.
“When the tsunami threat occurred last night, people still did their work on the beach and did not escape immediately, thus remaining victims, ” said the BNPB press representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the press conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but took along cars, logs and houses, wipeing everything off the ground, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved at an open sea speed of 800 km (800 km) an hour before it reached the shore.
Some people crawled out of trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to the center of Palu 24.
The air photos published by the Disaster Office showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mushes surrounded by water.
Follow-up in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
There was a wave of earthquakes in the area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Office (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released after a severe earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times higher than that of the nuclear bomb that was dropped into Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city on the long and narrow edge of the Gulf may have increased the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “perceptible ” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets, and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under the carvings of congested buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the dead could be larger in the coastal area north of Palus 300 km, called Donggala, which was closer to the wind of the earthquake.
The notifications from Donggaal “are completely incomplete and contain no information, ” said Nugroho.
“There are over 300 000 inhabitants in the district, ” said the Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It is already a tragedy that can get worse, ” he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the city of Palu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach while the warning was issued.
The amateurs in social media have seen a man on the top floor of a building who warns against the tsunami approaching people on the panicous street.
A minute later, the water wall gets to the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters failed to confirm the correctness of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large cut in electricity, which prevented communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue operations.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, which have been said by the authorities, but evacators are still desperately in need of food and other essentials.
The airport in the city was re-opened for rescue operations, leaving the rest closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of people killed by the Indonesian tsunami rose above 800.
It's really bad.
Although the World Vision staff from Donggala safely reached the city of Asku, where they were hidden in the performance tents set up in the courtyard of their office, they saw the muzzling image on their way, said Mr Doseba.
“They said that you saw many destroyed houses, ” he said.
It's really bad.
Although the aid forces strongly started disaster relief operations, part of the fact that the workers of large foreign aid organisations were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign funding, stocks and aid forces can only be sent if an accident is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the province level, ” said Aulia Arrian, Indonesian Red Cross pressman.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, it’s a national disaster, ’ we can start receiving international aid, but it’s not yet been declared that’
When the second night of prayer arrived after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends of the missing people and families were still full of hope that their loved ones would be the wonderful events that light the roots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the drain.
On Sunday, the saviors freed a woman who was trapped two days next to her mother's body in her fists.
The Indonesian National Slungeguard Team coach Gendon Subandono trained two lost Sluglinger for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of the people trapped in Roa Roa's hotel are his students, adding Mr. Mandagi.
“ As a senor, I have a personal load, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread among the Slugling Armors community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means that the messages didn’t arrive, ” he said.
The thieves took €23 585.88 during the execution of the ATM in Newport on the Lvees

Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
Mr. Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
On Saturday’s change in Twitter, the man wrote: “Andine Kanye West –
Since 41, West has been called Ye for some time and the man also used his name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change takes place before his performance on the broadcast Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to publish his new album in Yandhi.
He will replace Ariana Grandet, a singer on the show who cancelled his concert at “the hand of feelings, ” said the author.
In addition to being the short name of the man, West has said in advance that it is a word of religious importance for him.
“I think that “ye ” is one of the most used words in the Bible, meaning“ blue, ” said West earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio broadcast manager Big Boy.
“But I am you, I am us, these are us.
I changed my name from Kany, which means “it’s one, ” called Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The Album is more reflected in who we are,
Kanye West is not the only rapper who plays his name.
Sean Combs is primarily known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked together with West before, has also used his name with a critical meaning and without it, with large and small stars.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military forces against civilians
At a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the attack on the students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Sunday, Tlatelolco Plazas, promised that “no military would ever use the Mexicans to control the Mexicans.
The army attacked the peaceful demonstration of the field on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people while all of Latin America had been carrying left-wing student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly allowances and opening more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area, ” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and an artificial intelligence expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after various parts of the US Government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US generally lacks a strategy for artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China introduced last year its plan to be the maker of the 2030 renewal of artificial intelligence.
“A double budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, taking into account that other countries are so far behind the US and we are acting on behalf of the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence, ” said Lee.
Double funding would double the probability that the next major artificial intelligence would be achieved in the United States, said Lee CNBC this week's interview.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silkon Valley and the New World Order, ” published this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, a company that funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the best Othello player in America. Later, he was a man at Microsoft Research Board and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee recognised the previous US Government technology competitions such as the US Department of Defence Research Agency robotics Competition (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge) and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“The U.S. scientists must work hard to get government funding, ” said Lee.
“The Chinese is not the one who takes over the educational community; they are companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired high-tech researchers from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to support the efforts of artificial intelligence.
“I think that individuals who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card, ” said the man.
In July 2017, the Chinese Government published its next generation artificial intelligence development plan.
“The Chinese National Science Fund distributes funding to people working in academic institutions similar to how the National Research Fund and other government agencies allocate money to researchers in the USA, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, ” said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a combined artificial intelligence centre with the aim of involving partners from both industry and educational institutions, while the White House announced the establishment of a selected committee for artificial intelligence.
That month DARPA announced that it began to fund an initiative of $2 million for AI Next.
But the National Research Fund is currently funding over $100 million a year for research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been amended.
The Macedonians vote on the amendment of the country name at the referendum
During the Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted on whether to turn the name of the country into the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This would be a step that would also resolve the tens of decades of dispute with Greece, which has prevented the statements of accession to Macedonia to the EU and NATO.
Greece, where it is a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours constitutes a requirement for that territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments of the two countries agreed on the new name of Macedonia, but those against the nationalists claim that the name would undermine the national identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to vote in the referendum and has raised doubts as to whether electoral activity would achieve the 50% threshold required for a referendum.
The referendum asks: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the amendment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that have been created since the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young Macedonians so that they could live freely under the protective arm of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us, ” said Olivera Georgiyevska, who was 79 years old who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote in order to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of Parliament's majority is necessary for change of name.
The National Election Commission said that at 13:00 there were no reports of irregularities.
However, electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe, ” said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko, expressed their vote on 30 September 2018 in Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old, prepared a small stage, bringing a chair to the tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of the servants, ” Kavatarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have some dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become European-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more than 20% of the investments needed in Macedonia.
“I believe that a large majority supports change of name because more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of being part of the EU and NATO, ” said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said, \"Yes-word would be \"confirming our future,\"
The results of the survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies on Monday revealed that the referendum intends to take part 30 to 43 percent of voters who are below the necessary electoral activity.
A survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these 70 percent said, \"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow for the government's Western policy since the government took over last May.
View: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes to the gate for the name of the whole Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were invading the Brighton defence by guaranteeing Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like the gate he hit in his 65th play minutes came ridiculously.
The Argentinian attacker passed through the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton protectors before he got to the open field.
Then Aguer was surrounded by four green shirts.
He entered another defender before he ran across several players at the border of Brighton Penitentiary.
Then he hit the ball himself on the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton gate guard on the right side of the network with Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his legs, ” said Pep Guardiola’s reporters in Manchester City.
“We told him he was playing at 55 or 60 minutes.
It's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the gate at the moment.
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial success of the Premier League's fall.
The gate was hit at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly on Brighton's territory.
He sent the ball nicely to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane got to hit the ball a few times before he drove Sterling further away.
Sky Blues kicked the ball back into the net just before it slipped out of the border.
Manchester City plays with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckari Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rockies.
When the Nationals got sidetracked by the final tournament, there was no great reason to start again.
But Scherzer, who is willing to fight, hopes to do it on Sunday, Colorado Rockies, but only when Rockie, who is leading one of the Los Angeles Dodges game in NL West, is still hoping to get to the final.
On Friday night, Rockies guaranteed, at least five or five river stops of Nationals, but the team still wants to secure their first division.
“Even if we don’t play for something, we can at least try, knowing that playing in Denver with this audience and another team is probably a higher level than any other game that can wait for me this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight here?
Nationals haven't called a Sunday opening player yet, but they're supposed to tend to Scherzer's pitch.
Scherzer, for whom it would be 34th feeding, made a hot tub on Thursday and fed on Sunday normally.
This right-hand player in Washington runs 18-7, his ERA has 2,53, the number of exits 300 and the advantage of his 220 2/3 during this season.
Trump's got a cheer call from West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the electoral activity of the Republic in the intermediate elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It's a big event I'm not running in, but I'm actually running for it, so I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible, extreme group of Democrats, and you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power by using any means. You can see their meanness and dirty game.
The only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them.
Democrats are in his claim to be on a mission that aims to ‘ resist and prevent’.
“And you have seen it in the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats “false, wicked, lowly and false ”
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein, a democratic member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, who shouted out loud among the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, what?
No, no, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, in fact the worst language I've ever seen.
A lesbian party is no longer a big connection.
It is unacceptable for those expressing their opinion
When my local party of Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it wasn't very surprising.
After all, I am on the list of laboratory Members who are told that you are not welcome, and that is all for the publication of my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated equally in this Parliament because he was strongly opposed to the Jewish.
In my case, the condemned me for not consulting Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar issues, concerning which Jeremy was also dissented with previous leaders.
Nottingham's report from the East Labour Party stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and creative.
In a large part, the experience of my eight - year - long local laboratory fellow Member with meetings of the General Assembly of Friday evenings is exactly the same.
Unfortunately, as of today, this does not apply to most meetings and, unfortunately, the promise to be “lighter and generouser ” in politics has long been forgotten when it was never remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that different views are not acceptable in the Leiborist Party and that, for each opinion, those who are acceptable to the party's board of directors will be evaluated.
It began shortly after Jeremy became the leader. A fellow worker with whom I thought I would share similar political views was waiting now for me to change my mind and accept the views I would never have otherwise agreed on, regardless of whether it was a matter of national security or an EU single market.
Every time I step up in public, regardless of what I'm actually talking about, follow this condemnation in social media by encouraging my return, ignoring party politics and saying that I shouldn't be part of a Leiborist party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my fellow workers because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and resolve of fellow workers facing sexist or racist abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing views of this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become common.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that a Leiborist party should promote tolerance culture.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a large association and with every 'unity initiative' or change of electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, to speak less, and “it would be fine, ”
But that's not what I'm supposed to do in politics.
From the moment that I joined the Leiborist party 32 years ago, as a school student, motivated by the welfare of the government of Thatcher, which had left my great school classroom literally on the edge of collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who most need it, acting as Minister of the Local Council and Government.
I have never hid my politics, including in recent elections.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East was confused about my political positions or the areas of non-consumption with my local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But actually, the only message I have is for Nottingham Momentum, but for my advocates, whether they belong to a Leiborist party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of refoulement or political consideration will stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have narrowed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves this wonderfully fun Tennett's first too game to win.
They're now the only unbeatable team on the front line of the table of ten.
After all, it was a high level of protection and better risk taken by the team to win and coach Peter Murchiel is completely entitled to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested all the time during the games, and we’re still undefeated, so of course I’m happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said: “Pean Ayrist’s story, they used their chances better than ours.
Grant Anderson's 14th playtime experiment, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a success, but the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, who was given the game by the warlors, gave Melros the chance of Jason Baggot's failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayri’s progress with a penalty immediately before the end of the semester, reaching an individual event by the end of the half-life in favour of 17 - Ayri.
But Melrose has successfully begun the second half, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which he took over Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken off on the tray. The game continued to increase Ayr's success further thanks to the Stafford McDowall test, which was transmitted by Climo.
Ayri's CEO, Blair Macpherson, was then on a yellow card, but again, Melrose's player paid for the attempt by Bruce Colvine after strong pressure.
However, the team playing in the field was reassembled, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the penalty line, he put MacPherson behind the progressive Ayrs.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after continuing the game, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box and sent a side guard to Gregor Henry to go home to play the team in the fifth test.
Still Game Star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran seems willing to enter the field of catering after it was discovered that the man was appointed director of a recognised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC TV series, which he writes and where he plays with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphilli.
A couple have reported that the next nine seasons will be the last of the series and it seems that Kiernan will make life after the new plans of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would like to join the rocking restaurant in Glasgow.
“The Sea is ours: Bolivia without sea borders hopes that the Court will return to them on the Pacific side
Marines patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags floating above the offices' buildings.
To the Marine Bases from Lake Titica to Amazon, the introduction is: “Meri is our right.
Our duty to restore it is to:
Without a sea border in Bolivia, the memory of the coastal line that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a decision to be taken on 1 October by the International Court of Justice after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and the country is naturally waiting for a good result, ” said Bolivia’s diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
The Hulk Bolivists across the country will look at the decision of the international court on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia for decades in order to give its last independent path to the sea.
The Carismian President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who is waiting for the conflicting fight to be re-election next year, is under great weight in the Monday's decision.
“We’re very close to returning to the Pacific, ” she swore at the end of August.
Some analysts believe, however, that the Court is likely not to vote for Bolivia, or, if so, very little.
The United Nations authorities in the Netherlands do not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and it has provided that the outcome of any negotiations is not determined.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice will be taken only six months after hearing the final statements indicates that it was not “a complicated case, ” said Paz Zárate, an expert in Chile’s international law.
And from the additional causes of Bolivia, the last four years may have made the situation worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian authorities, ” said Zárate.
In the Morales war, the beauty talk has lost the rest of Chile's charity, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after that, the debate will be extremely difficult.
Two countries have not exchanged their ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Mr Rodríguez Veltz, who is a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unnecessary.
Monday will give Bolivia a special opportunity to start a new era in the country's relations with Chile, and the opportunity to “stop the differences of 139 years with mutual benefit, ” she said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue to express political concern.
“Bolivia never gives up her right to access the Pacific Ocean, ” she added.
\"A chance to see that we have to overcome the past\"
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the country can trust the United States of America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never give up nuclear weapons first unless you could trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Meeting on Saturday.
He called on the United States of America to review the promises made by the state leaders of competitors at the Singapore Summit.
He will comment on the matter while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems almost to begin again with a clog of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, it is air stores that the US is continuing to restrict and refuse to end the war with Korea.
Washington is careful about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards armamenting.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, scepticism is widespread, according to which Pyongyang intends to give up the weaponry that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
The Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another summit between Kimi and Trump.
Paris fashion fairs bring to the viewer a series of massive headgear to the purchasers on their neighborhood shopping streets
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look for it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of strange main covers to the stage during their summer season 2019, which blinded Paris’s fashion week.
High and impractical hats will be fashioned this summer through Instagram, and these designers have sent their walking creations to fashions.
Valentino’s top work was the model’s heads covering the overpacked beige hat, which was decorated with a reminder of a wide range of ends.
Other extremely large clothing included arbouses, sorceress hats and even an annass, but their purpose is not to heat up.
Thom Browne also showed a strange choice of masks, doing it just in time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were congruent mouths, so they reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than they did.
One part of the creation reminded me of the dive suit with the air pipes and glasses, while the other one reminded me of the melted iced roof.
And if you keep going with the giant molarings, you're lucky.
Moegurud predicts that super-sized headgear can also reach your nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats are coming right on La Bomba, which is a shoulder hat with a width of 60 centimetres, seen in the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult trademark, which created a highly impractical hat in the social media, sent them another large work – a coastal bag of straws, almost as large as its model of bikinis.
The dark orange raffia bag with raffia perma and white leather stang was at the top of the Jacquemus La Riviera summer collection in Paris this week.
Luke Armitage, from the style of hearings, said to FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags in the shopping streets next summer.
John Edward: Language Skills Important to World Citizens
Scotland’s private schools have remained the front page of the academic excellence and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, which will be reinforced by personal and shared success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
The schools where more than 30 000 students are studying across Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), try to offer their students and their parents the best service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As a education sector that is able to design and implement a learning programme adapted to circumstances, we see that modern languages continue to be known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak a person in a language that is understood to him, it comes to his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it comes into his heart,
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
The recent results of this year’s examination show that the pre-printing of tables are languages with the highest level of examination among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from a total of 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students became Mandarin A, the same grades became German-language students 72 percent, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as important skills for life, which children and young people undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages that are now among the choice of subjects are similar to those of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private schools and other schools.
The study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, among the reasons why it is difficult for employers to find job vacancies, 17% of respondents had no language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly compulsory to prepare young people for their future work.
Since more promising job offers require language skills, such skills in the global world are becoming essential.
Regardless of the career choices made, the acquisition of another language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals gives a competitive advantage to a multilingual person immediately.
According to the YouGov survey conducted by more than 4000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of the respondents speak no foreign language well enough to hold a conversation about it. The only language with two seats was French by 15%.
Therefore, the funding of language learning is important to children today.
Skills in several languages, especially in developing countries, provide children with better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at each school.
Hulk school focuses more on modern classical languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Notwithstanding the interest of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the necessary skills to achieve success, regardless of what the future will bring them.
It can no longer be denied that languages in a global business environment are vital for the future of the country and must therefore be reflected in education.
It is true that modern languages should be considered “inter-national communication skills ”
Private schools continue to provide young Scottishs with choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Council of Private Schools in Scotland.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Zealous admirers don't have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton reported that James is playing the Denver Nuggetts in San Diego during the Sunday opening game.
But the number of his game minutes still needs to be determined.
“It’s more than one and less than 48, ” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell's commitment that James is likely to play countless minutes.
After last week's training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers pre-game schedule.
“I don’t need my career at this stage of the season games to warm myself, ” he said.
Trump Western Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his election campaign event series tonight in Wheelingus West Virginia.
This is the five campaign event scheduled for the first week of Trump, including suspensions in friendly places such as Pennsylvania and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote is still valid until Trump chooses to appoint the President of the Supreme Court, he seeks to increase the support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened by the abolition of control at Congress following a vote in November.
What time is Trump's campaign event in West Virginia tonight, and how do you view it on the Internet?
The Trump campaign event in Wheelingus West Virginia will take place on Saturday evening, 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m. East Coast time.
The Trump Western Virginia campaign event can be viewed online through YouTube streaming.
It's likely Trump will speak of the meetings of the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which became tense with regard to the charges of sexual abuse, and at the same time, the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI's case is examined.
However, the main objective of the campaign series is to help gather new momentum for Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump’s campaign manager said that the goal of these five events next week is “to encourage volunteers and supporters when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives, ” he provided for Reuters.
“Accessing the Congress is so important for the president’s agenda that Trump is going to go to as many states as possible in the run-up to the election campaign, ” said Trump, a spokesperson for the campaign of Reuters, who did not want to mention his name.
Tonight’s campaign event, planned to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheelinus, may be brought to the attention of supporters “Ohiost and Pennsylvania and can also be reflected in the Pittsburgh media, ” reported West Virginia Metro News.
It is the second time on Saturday when Trump visits West Virginia in the last month. This is the state where he received more than 40 percent of the voters' votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is running the charts based on polls.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has come to stimulate his results, ” said Politologist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team shares nerves by keeping hopes high before Sundays alone games
After three one-sided sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating turning point on the pendel is a fully fictional concept of sport, but players believe in it truly, especially in competitions like this here.
So, where do they think would be the turning point now?
“They led the six points that have now become four, so I think it might be considered a small turning point, ” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, because it is managed by four points and there are 12 points left in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel that they don't have enough wind in the sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each received three of the four points.
Spieth has been a pedestrian in both the wings and the grin and set an example.
These whirlwinds of victory were becoming more and more pronounced with each circle, by sheltering the decisive pot that would have led to the fourth match after he and Thomas were in the country.
His bag, which won the match on 15th, sent a similar cry that showed a man's faith that the Americans are not yet out of the race.
“You just need to focus on playing and worrying about your fight, ” said Spieth.
It's the only thing the players can do.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players who have more points after the last two days than Spiethil and Thomas have Ryder Cup on the undisputed stars of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but loved couple is four out of four, and nothing can go wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only couple who didn’t hit the Bogey Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogeys also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on Friday morning.
This game and the way in which their energy flows into such a loud crowd, when it comes back, strengthens the opinion that players with whom it is won on Sunday, and that when the sun is set over Le Golf National, there is no possible European victory to be confirmed by the most famous player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is preferable for both different holes at the same time.
The story of Europe's glory is, however, premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, four-ball hero this morning, a quick job when a man and Alex Noren were put in a couple.
Bogey and the two in the first nine dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
On Saturday, however, there's no one to help you out in August.
Four-balls and couple games are extremely attractive to look at the relationship between couples, the advice given to each other, the unreached advice and the way in which it can change at a moment.
Europe has played as a team better so far and has started to lead a strong success for the last day, but this session of the girls shows that the US team is divided into a series of nerves with some, especially Americans, in order to fight.
Europe is in charge of Ryder Cup on the last day of 10-5
Europe will be a great success on the last day of Ryder Cup, starting to lead 10 to the United States after Saturdays four-balls and couple games.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-winner Tiger Woods to raise their current score in Le Golf Nationals to four points.
Thomas Bjorn from Europe, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the bear lost in Hazeltine, reigned after the failure of the American side in the morning four-ball, winning a series of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance, winning two games, but they couldn't compensate for the deficit.
Jim Furyki needs eight points to keep a cup from the Sunday 12 individual games.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who won four points in a row. Together with Molinari, who is called Molliwood after such a long weekend, is the second pair who has won four points in Ryder Cup history in their fourth opening game.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four-balls, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeveel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random shine, but now he lost his 29 four-balls and a couple-game 19, with seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested off for four in the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to match the two-to-one Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who is in the world sequence in first and third place.
Europe did not succeed, although the contest was held pleasant and windy in the south of Paris.
Three times the big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for the Americans on Saturday as a benchmark.
They won a certain victory in the four-balls over 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter, later on, and won the pair game Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3 after losing two openings.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team returned from a four-point deficit going into single games, although the owner needs only a pin to preserve the furyki side of the cup.
While two days in the second place, after the Sunday attack, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that \"in no way will they be armed by one-sided lack of trust\"
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing restrictions have deepened their distrust against the United States and that, under these conditions, the country will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has over the last year adopted “markable goodwill measures, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the decomposition of a nuclear site and the promise to not spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we do not see the US answer to that, ” he said.
“Untrusted by the United States, our country has no security security security, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to take up unilaterally the first weapon -
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's resistance to the \"consumption-free\" approach to nuclear weapon-freeisation, under which North Korea would be rewarded when he took gradual steps, his statement made it important that he did not reject unilateral nuclear weapons, as has been done in the past by Pyongjang.
On 12 June, Ri referred to Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump's joint statement at a summit between the President of the United States and North Korea's leader in Singapore, when Kim promised to move to the direction of the Korean peninsula's nuclear weapons and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has requested the official termination of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
“The United States calls for the initial abandonment of nuclear weapons and increases the pressure to achieve their goal in a forced manner, even in response to the declaration of war ending, ” Ri said.
“The limitations on our knees will be a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions deepen our distrust,
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was emphasised earlier this week by the US leader at the UN.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the last five months of meeting between the three leaders of Kim and South Korea Moon Jae-ini and added: “If one of the parties involved in the issue of nuclear weapons were South Korea, not the United States, the Korean peninsula’s nuclear weapons issue would not have reached such a impasse:
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was markedly different from last year's when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable after Mr. Paha's President Trump called himself the \"missileman\" at Kim's suicide mission.
This year, North Korea was fully welcomed by the threatened Trump in the United Nations to the sky of Kim for his courage to take steps towards non-armour, but added that there is still much to be done and that restrictions must remain in force until North Korea's nuclear weapons are abandoned.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no schedule for doing so, saying: “This will take two years, three years or five months - this is not important –
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, US Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: \"The enforcement of the Security Council's restrictions must continue forcefully and without failure until we can fully and definitively confirm the abandonment of nuclear weapons\".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions on North Korea by trying to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
He met Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Bombeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a Jewish meeting with Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made, after what North Korea realized in just a few hours, “for the demands of gangsters. ”
North Korea allowed the missiles and nuclear complex to be decommissioned during the meeting with Moon this month, if the United States were to take appropriate measures.
He said that Kim had told him that “consistent measures ” meant the security guarantees allowed in Trump Singapore and the move towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to rest enough
This year, the Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight a growing aggressive culture, where they learn through a night-to-night learning marathon.
Students who love academicism at the world’s best university are often helpless when it comes to basics of caring for themselves.
According to this course designer Charles Czeisler, Professor Charles Czeisler, a dream doctor and a professor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and the Women's Hospital, this is the first one in the United States.
He inspired the creation of a course after he gave a speech on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“ At the end of this, a girl came to me and asked: ‘ Why is it not until now that I am told in my last year of school? ’
He said that no one ever told him the significance of the dream - it turned me into a ghost, he explained to the Telegraph.
The course, which came first this year, explains to students how good dreams contribute to academic and sporting results and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and head of university, said that the university decided to take the course curriculum after finding that the students were in serious trouble sleeping on the week of work.
The hourly course covers a number of counter-active tasks.
In one part, you can click on coffee bars, curtains, sports footwear and books and explain the effects of caffeine and light on how sleeplessness affects sports performance and the importance of bedtime practice.
The second part explains how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, together with the counter-active symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily established practice.
“We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes – added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, night-long learning marathons are still proud of adding that modern techniques and increasing pressure on students means rather that sleep shortages are still a growing problem.
“The guarantee of a high-quality sleeper should be a student’s “sala arm ” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added. “It even helps to fight weight gain because lack of sleep makes the brain hunger mode, constantly making the person hungry, ” he added.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler to set up a course, having attended one of his classes in the previous, his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all postgraduate students to go through a similar study programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students make a wake-up watch both for sleep and wake-up, and be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lighting, as this may damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga the gate was defeated by Gerradi's men
The Rangers suffered another bad guest game when Dolly Men and the hit that was sent from the side by Steven Gerrard brought 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox's side was hoping to get his first guest victory since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused the second loss of Gerrard in 18 games as a leader, leaving Ladbrokes Premiership from Hearts with eight points behind.
Menga created his gate seven minutes before the Polish season and the poor readiness of Rangers could not recover from it.
The Rangers will therefore fall to the sixth place, Livingston will rise to the third place, remaining in Hibernia with only one gate.
For Rangers, the problems may not be over, because their attackman, Calum Spence, needed a head wound treatment after he got hit with a apparently disposed object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that led to the semifinal of Ayris and Betfred Cup.
But at the same time, Holt went on to the same Liv 11 who took a point from Hearss last week and would have been satisfied with how his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate on the second opening, when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the half protector didn't take his chances.
Deep Keaghan Jacobs release found then Captain Craig Halketti, but its defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide arc hit in the back of the post.
The Rangers did get control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he would have had a penalty if he and Steven Lawless got in touch with the 15th minutes, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
The Rangers managed to target only two blows in the first half, but former Ibrox gateman Liam Kelly did not feel worried about not Lassana Coulibally's head blow or the Ovie Ejaria event.
Although Liv's 34th-minute prom might have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely because of their performances.
Once again, Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep, heavy performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball with Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose the Men who just led the plan to the end.
Gerrard was in the middle of his shift, switching to Coulibaly Ryan Kent.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game as suitable for those where Lithgow and Halket picked up long balls.
Holt's side might have been able to promote his leadership at the end, but McGregor stood firm, stopping Jacobs from hitting Lithgow from the corner with a big curve.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again applied for a penalty blow when he and Jacobs jumped, which Thomson was not satisfied again.
Almanahh: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now page from our Sunday Morning Almanahhis: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago and LOENDES ... the day when a future physicsr was born in Germany, Johannes Wilhelm-Hans- Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
From the beginning of science, Geiger’s counter also became a pop culture platform, like in the 1950s “Coronado Watches, ” where in the main parts they were apparently unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: “What is this thing?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these earphones are applied, it is possible to hear the atom potina that has been released from the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: “Don’t tell me this is going to go away.
“Hans. Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to see – traitor cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” the traitor cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know about the treatment of traitor cells
The method involves the uptake of immune cells from the patient and the modification of these cells in the laboratory
Then, they can “stamp ” for many cancers, and they will be given back to the injection.
The vaccine in the study shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the detection of ovarian cells to her immune system disappeared from her ovary cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory so that they can receive ‘skin’ protein that is common to different HER2 cancers and then inject these cells back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesdas Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 – leads to the growth of many types of cancer – including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach in which patients receive immune cells and are taught to target cancer cells has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.

The glory of the Thrones Game Kit Harington does not approve of the glazed masculine
Kit Harington is well-known for his sword - flashing role in Jon Snowina HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series of Thrones game.
However, the actor (31) spreads the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they must be harsh.
Speaking of The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “anything has gone wrong ” and raised the question of how to solve the masculine problem of the bet in the era of MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a fellow member of the Troon game, acknowledged that she felt “systly ” that this problem needed attention.
“I feel really personally now that we have gone wrong somewhere else, ” he said.
“What we’ve taught men when they grow up is the problem we’re seeing now, ” he says.
Kit believes that the rise in the masculinity of the bet is partly responsible for television, because it shows supermanial figures.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be just like when they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
For obviously something has gone wrong for the young men,
In the survey, he also admitted that, after the end of the series, none of the Thrones’ games were involved in any of the following summer, saying that he was “one of their fighting grounds and horses on one side ”
From November, Kit Sam Shepardi will participate in the revitalizing of True West, a story about the film maker and his kidnapped brother.

Rose played with Emmy the award of the fantasy series Ygritte, Kit's figure track Jon Snow loved.
A couple married Leslie's family home in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living in HIV and AIDS has risen to 14%.
Health care professionals say that more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have arisen from sex, changing the past.
HIV was rapidly transmitted through some infected blood transfusions in China .
However, in this way the number of people infected with HIV had decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed that it was at a conference in the Province of Yunnan.
Since the year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has grown by 100,000 in China.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBTs is allegedly high.
Because of the country's old-fashioned values, studies reveal that 70-90% of men having sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases relate to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has allowed universal access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaking of the GOP senator's data, saying that it is a “hazard of lies and conspiracy theory ”
On Saturday, the U.S. representative Maxine Waters condemned the claims that his employee had posted the Wikipedia pages of three Republican senators' personal data.
In Los Angeles, Democrat confirmed that such claims are disseminated by “ultra-right-wing” trolls and their websites.
“ The lies, lies, and even more despicable lies, ” Waters said in his Twitter application.
The published information allegedly included home addresses and telephone numbers for US senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utahist).
The information was published on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel in connection with the claims of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pound and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the post, was related to the Waters office and issued membership information of the employee under Waters, reported Hill.
“This unjustified claim is a complete and absolute lie, ” Waters continued.
‘My staff, whose personal data and safety are threatened by their fraudulent claims and false claims, shall not be liable in any way for this information breach.
This unjustified argument is a complete and irrefutable lie –
Waters’s application was quickly evaluated on the Internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial comes from anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that he has an emotion that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They must not be trots.
They must not question the prosecution's motives.
They must remain calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters reaction to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who were accused by critics of being too angry at hearing Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is also applying for Waters in the interim elections, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“In the case of the truth, he was moved.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities of administration and law enforcement regarding their fraudulent claims”
“We are all doing everything to find out the criminals, ” he continued, “and to make them legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my workers, ” he said.
Film Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The Spion Bar by Rowan Atkinson
It is now the custom that Brexit’s meanings are sought in all the new British films, and it seems to be particularly appropriate for Johnny English’s mercenary parodes, which began in 2003 with Johnny English, and was rescheduling Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Are you kidding yourself about how clearly stupid we are in the new country's export option?
In any case, Johnny English has been given permission to do things once again in its colossal manner - and that this wide comic is intended for film territories speaking non-English.
Of course, this is a secret agent who, despite his strange pretentious smut-glamour, reminds a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr Bean and a little of the character of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a passenger in the characters bill and on the international mysterious Atkinson, who was once played in forgotten Barclaycard's television commercials, leaving nothing but chaos behind.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE film.
I liked the Johnny English helicopter approach when he was carrying the medieval gun and the helicopter's winged his helmets.
Atkinson’s talent to make a physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely excessive, especially as “serious ” spy movies such as 007 and the Mission Impossible offer themselves confident comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English's clever adventures are not as resourceful and focused as the Atkinson's dark movies Beanina.
Today, it is forever the current assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has penetrated the Great Britain's Web Network of High Secret Sponsors by revealing the personalities of all British Secret Police, thus creating a major disappointment to the local agent - a regrettablely small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a solemn and troubled character who suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this finely, but there is not much in the manuscript to work on.
His intelligence advisors suggest that since all active spies have been compromised, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who is now working as a school teacher in a proud institution, giving a secret lesson about how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers the School of Rock-type spy school.
English will be flown back to Whitehall for extraordinary information, and he will be reunited with his former long-term partner, Bough, who will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service shame seals are again in action, meeting Olga Kurõlenko with a beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the charismatic engineering billionaire's hands. He claims he can solve all British computer problems: the unfortunate Jason Volta, who is playing Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their thirsty odyssey: hiding as a performer, they set fire at a French restaurant; they create chaos by holding cover on the board of the Volta luxury yacht; and English starts a real mess when he tries to use the main set of virtual reality to get acquainted with the inside of the Volta House.
There are no brakes used in this last section, but as sweet and stormy as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV maikke.
That's pretty medieval stuff.
And just as in other Johnny English movies, I got to the point: does the British film industry really not have the role to play for Rowan Atkinson, which would be fair to his talent?
The working party denies drawing up a plan where the British work for four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyni's Labour Party has considered a reverse plan that requires the British to work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
The party wants the company's executives to pass on an artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to saved workers, giving them an additional free day.
So the employees would have a three-day weekend, but they'd get the same salary.
According to Allika, this idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and will therefore be subject to the country's demise in favour of its employees.
Thursday's working week has been approved at the Congress of the Union for Trade in order to allow workers to exploit the changing economy.
The source of the working party told the Sunday Times: “It is said that the review of the draft will be announced before the end of the year.
“This is not happening overnight, but Thursday’s working week is a effort that is compatible with the Party’s approach to balance the economy for the benefit of workers as well as with the Party’s overall industrial strategy.
The working party is not the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party also allowed a Thursday work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Press Officer of the Labour Party stated: “The working week does not have a party policy and the party does not discuss it –
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to specify his vision of a socialist turn of economy.
McDonnell said he's decided to take power back from the communist companies' \"like leaders\" and \"profit-makers\".
The plans of the deputy Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire participation, since the Party could do “declarations ” with regard to perceived wrongdoing.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in company boards and to create equity funds to provide 10% of the private sector's equity to employees instead of providing annual bonuses up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak on the show “60 Minutes ” whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their minds
The investigation of charges against Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Bureau's conclusions could have an impact on the closure of the Republican senators' support.
During the Sunday survey, you received the “60 Mints ” of CoC Scott Pelley of Republicans from Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could reveal something that might make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Obviously, ” said Kennedy.
“I told you I was going to the interrogation, and I said I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out, and I said, \"Did you do this?\"
He was decisive, sure, and unambiguous,
Graham's voice seems to be on a cliff.
“I’m sure about Brett Kavanaugh in my decision and can only be changed in the bomb news, ” he said.
“Dr Ford, I don’t know how it happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it, ” said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he called could not confirm.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I can't see anything new coming up.
What is the global Citizens' Festival Global Citizen Festival and has helped to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival is organising an annual musical event, which has a tremendously impressive participation of celebrities and the same impressive goal of losing poverty from the world.
Now, for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Card B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real purpose of the event, namely ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international lawyers who hope to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To obtain a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or volunteer activities, send an e-mail to a world leader, call or do something other important to help raise awareness of their purpose in terms of poverty eradication.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if there are still 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another click feature where people feel they do something important by signing a statement online or by saying something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million actions to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $ 37 billion of their commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notices resulting from their activities and of which at least USD 10 billion have already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that nearly 649 million people worldwide have so far been directly affected by guaranteed funds.
Some of the main commitments include the partnership between investors and developers in the United Kingdom The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “supporting the full potential of children, ” allowing Rwanda to give $35 million to help stop malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 benefits from the Global Citizens.
“ With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote to social injustice, ” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also informed that, after more than 5,000 activities that called for improvements in mothers and children's nutrition in the UK, the government announced a funding project for The Power of Nutrition, reaching 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to a KKK on its website asking, \"which makes you think we can end extreme poverty\"
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult road - sometimes we fail and fall.
But as we face great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are sure of our success because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is just a couple of performers who will take up this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Marines 'intention' to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister for the Interior
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may use its marine forces if necessary to prevent Russia's energy market from being hit, including in the Middle East, by U.S. Internal Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, in particular if it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse for researching new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to exchange energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of South Europe, ” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States of America has this opportunity by means of our Navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, blocked, so that their energy does not enter the market, ” he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to the participants in the events organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation representing the voice of the US-energy consumer.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, indicating that they were essentially the same.
“The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, the leverage and the replacement of fuels, ” he said, while referring to Russia as “one trick to the pony, ” whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is responsible for increasing the export of LNG to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince the Germans themselves to remove the “unsuitable” project Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into Moscow’s \"convict\".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which doubles existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's acute opposition to the project has simply been driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure publication and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers, ” said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy, at a meeting in Moscow in September with US Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The USA's attitude has been a setback from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leading industrial organisation, the German Labour Union (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a major problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply, ” said President of the German Industry Union (BDI) Dieter Kempf, following the recent German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running as President in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts.
In the interim elections, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he was seriously considering running for president.
In Holyoke's rakejas, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering his candidacy.
“ It is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and it includes the first lady, ” she said The Hill.
\"From November 6th, I am seriously considering running for President-in-Office\"
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump in the House, saying that he was moving the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m seriously concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy, ” he said.
Warren has published criticisms towards Trump and the candidate for this Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday's contribution to Warren: “I hope we need an FBI investigation before we vote.
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think he should apply in 2020.
According to the study of the Political Research Centre/Boston Globe at Suffolk University, 58% of the candidates thought that a senator should not apply.
32% supported this type of application.
The survey showed more support for the candidate office of former governor Dev Patrick, 38% supported the possible application and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with possible 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that she would formally decide by January, announced Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quoted Track Palin PTSDs at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin (26) spent a year recruitment for September of Iraq.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with charges.
“What my son lives through when he comes back, I can relate myself to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning to, ” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s gathering in Tulsa, Spain.
Palin called on his son to be arrested “in an alien room, ” and said regarding his son and other war veterans,“they come back a little differently, they come back as punishments, and they come back thinking if they have had enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all the other militarymen have given to the country, ”
He was arrested on Monday in Alaska and Dan Bennett, spokesperson at the Wasillas Police Department, accused of domestic violence against women, in an intervention report on domestic violence and in a drunk state in possession of a gun.
The 18 states and the Columbia region challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge of a new US policy that prohibits asylum for victims who are fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 representatives of the country and the region presented a brief statement by friends in Washington to support the evasive policy of asylum seekers, NBC News announced.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union presented in August against Union policy has not been published.
The woman said that her partner, and her violent sons, abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her request for asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The national lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing a large number of US asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeal for Migrants, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, chief prosecutor of the Columbia region, said in Friday that the new policy \"is ignoring decades of national, Union and international law\"
\"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved in accordance with specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such a requirement violates this principle,\" he said.
The lawyers also argued in their brief that the ban on entry of immigrants is damaging to the US economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and – they are offering the necessary labour force –
In June, the chief prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered that the immigration courts no longer give asylum to victims who fled from domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The application for asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear as regards race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion, ” said the Senate in its communication of 11 June.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertainment rescue operations in Palus, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
The situation for survivors was becoming more and more threatening.
“The situation is very intense, ” said the 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, who was comforted by her fever in the city evacuation center of Palu.
“In every minute, new people will arrive with ambulances.
There's not enough clean water.
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that had been damaged by 7.5-magnituated earthquakes were unburdened.
Some injured, including broken backs and upper arms, in Dwi Haris, rested outside of Palu's army hospital, where patients continued to be treated under field conditions due to strong posteriors.
The pajamas filled his eyes when he recalled the strong earthquake shaking his fifth floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We had time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed against the wall, ” said Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger.
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for “distorting advertising”
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published four-page advertising on the basis of the mutual benefit of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador accused Beijing in China of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump referred to the last Wednesday's addition by China Daily in Des Moines Register - with the biggest tiara in the state of Iowa - after China was accused of intervention in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in US elections marked what US officials described Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expansion campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to promote trade in advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, where import tariffs are adjusted for each other.
China's countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were intended to target exporters from States such as Iowa because they supported the parties of the Trump Republicans, China and the US experts have explained.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, as well as the Chinese largest exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad, in the Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article, wrote: “The Chinese have now doubled their bullying by publishing the proclamations in our free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious freedom of expression and free press practice, placing its paid advertising in Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
“However, there are only limited votes in Beijing Street, and there are no truly different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly at the hands of the Communist Party of China, ” he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding Chinese newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say what the newspaper was doing.
Analysts warn that the Republicans host women’s elections before the interim elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of multiple sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a setback, especially from women, during the forthcoming interim elections.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be recovered, ” said Maxwell School of Political Sciences Professor Grant Reeher, a member of the University of Syriac, in his article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last minute's attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI would be sufficient to calm down angry voters.
“Women do not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November, ” said on Friday, the senior advisor of the progressive group MoveOn and the national representative, Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC, according to the newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protestors “November is coming, ” in a demonstration in their Senate corridor, because Republicans who are controlling the Committee of Judges decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite Dr Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, reported Mic.
“Democratic Induction and Influenza are beginning to fall out of schedule, ” said Stu Rothenberg, an informal political analyst.
“The people say it is already high, it is true.
However, it may be higher, especially among the peripheral female voters and among the younger voters aged 18-29 who are not fond of and often abstained from voting.
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court, the analysts predicted a setback when the Republicans moved on with confirmation.
“It has become very confusing for the GOP, ” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
“This is not just about the Commission’s vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is to be appointed, but also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it, ” said Guy Cecil, the President of the United States (Group which helps the Democrats to choose) drew attention to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believe in the testimony of Ford and who of Kavanaugh, but a little more by supporting the first.
The new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were sure or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same for Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other charges against Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford admitted last week before the Senate Committee of Judges, under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court’s candidate showed him his genitals when they attended a party in Yale in 1980.
World Wide Web inventor intends to launch a new internet that would feature the front with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launched a start-up company trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of technology delegates Inrupt is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solids allow users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In exceptional questioning to Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun that Inrupt’s goal was “to rule the world...
“We should do this now, ” he said about the start-up company.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online database – or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and simultaneously.
This personal online database makes it unique for the user to be able to choose who can access this information.
This is referred to by the company as “the provision of individual powers through data”
According to John Bruce, the company's leader is Inrupt's idea to bring sources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the developers who have been hired to work in the project under the contract, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to \"Facebook and Google whether to bring in a complete change when all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
\"We don't ask their permission...
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s aim is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect Solid’s new web integrity and quality.

Bernard Vann: A spiritual memorial stone baptized by Victoria in World War I
The Church of England, which was baptized by Victoria during World War I, celebrated the 100th anniversary of its hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann fought his badge out on 29 September 1918 in Bellenglis and Lehaaucourt.
But he died four days later a sniper took a bullet and didn't know he had received the highest British army rank.
His two grandsons opened the Memorial Stone on Saturday in the Northamptonshire in Ruschanti.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it would be “naturally symbolic ” if the stone were to open exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s prized battle.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann, on 29 September 1918 led his Battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentini, with a very thick fog and rifle and a ball-pointing ball -
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it on with a “greater galaxy ” before speeding up to one machineper by himself, and causing three of the opposites to be taken away.
On October 4, 1918, the German sniper was killed by Lieutenant-Colonel Vanni, when only a little more than a month had remained until the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s activity was “anything I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful, ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a house after a parade led by Brentwood's conservative youth band.
Michael Vann said that he is “very honored to attend this parade, ” adding that“ so many people are present and supported shows that a true hero can be appreciated ”
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 to look up all night, but only Põrsa Peppa
Imagine you've been up all night to watch Bellator 206, but that's not even an event for you.
The San Jose match contained 13 battles, including six key maps, and was shown on 5th channel in the United Kingdom all night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald were making each other up to the front, the UK viewers had their mouths up and down, because Põrsa Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not inspired by it, especially those who had remained awake until early hours to see this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's comics on Twitter as “a joke that hurts me.
“This is the government regulation that at 6:00 a.m., the content was no longer suitable and had to be switched to children’s program, ” explained Dave Schwartz, the senior Vice President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues when asked about the transfer.
‘In Peppa, in Hell, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.’
Bellator President Scott Coker said that they were going to work on their schedule to take more account of UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about the re-enactment, I think we can solve this problem in the future, ” Coker said.
“But if it is six Sunday mornings there, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was modified, there was much back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we show a reference - as we normally do - trying to give more to fans and we just went over time.
This is a very serious situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt like a minor in relation to sexuality.
The Olympic winner, Tom Daley, says that he grew up feeling that he was inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A young man of 24 years said that he did not understand until he went to high school that “one is not like him ”
While participating in Lauren Laverne's Radio 4, Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
Being a parent also changed his attitude toward winning the Olympic Games, giving him the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You will receive the usual long-term escort, Kirsty Young, for his illness, he had to take a few months off.
In Laverne's first show, he said that he felt less valuable growing than others because he wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings are that I am not worthy and that I feel different, gave me power and strength to succeed, ” he said.
He wanted to prove that he was “no matter what, ” and he did not disappoint others when they finally learned about sexuality.
The two-time Pronks Olympic winner has become a highly valued leader of the LGBT campaign, using his appearance to the National Community Games of this year in Australia to address more countries to decriminize homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and he wanted to give hope to others too.
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with the man - the US film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - “he surprised him as a surprise ”
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years ago last year, but she said that the difference between age and age has never been a problem.
“ When you were so young, ” she went to her first Olympics when she was 14 years old, and her father died of cancer three years later - it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and dimensions.
A couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “all prospect ” had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything had to do with winning the gold medal, ” he said.
“But you know, there are many important things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My olympic gold medal is Robbie...
His son received his name after Robert his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, following the diagnosis of a brain tumor.
Daley said his father refused to die, and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that, “Dad, you can’t sit in the front row, because by then you’re no longer, ” he said.
“ I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, ” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the Olympic Games of 2012 and won the Bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had been dreaming about all my life - to dive in front of a home crowd in the Olympic Games, ” he said.
It also inspired his first play - Heather Small Proud - which helped him prepare the Olympic Games and still creates a chicken skin for him.

Out of the box, Mickelson was removed on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid the unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years at the event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's match and four-ball.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as it has often been for the US, the five-time winner divided his day into two, as an incentive and working on his game, hoping to fix it.
Not ever the most direct hitter, not even his career at the peak, is 48-year-old especially suitable for playing on a narrow Le Golf National golf course where long rough track punishes constantly lost punch.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will be standing on Sunday, his ninth race against the exact British Open champion of Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If the Americans, who are behind the 12 single points at the beginning of the game, are hot, the Mickelson competition can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he didn't have much more to add.
“He fully understood his part of today, put me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said he was ready for tomorrow, ” added Furyk.
“He is very confident.
He's a celebrity, and he's given our teams so much in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I saw more than that, but that's how it went, and we had to pick a path like that.
He wants to be out, like everyone else.
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo record on Sunday as the most involved player in Ryder Cup games.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which, however, has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven weeks, but Furyk said that his presence has provided the team with an additional spiritual contribution.
“He’s funny, funny, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he’s just great in the team room, ” he explained.
“I think younger players had a lot of fun going up to him this week and it was great to see it.
He offers much more than just a game –
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great success can soon be lost
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup at the beginning of the individual games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
In the 1997 contest in Valderrama, where five-point success countries were held in front of the Americans together with Captain Seve Balleseros, but over the finish line it was dramatically degraded, and only 141-2 : 131-2 was won.
“You may even recall that we had a great leadership in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this victory very little, ” said Bjorn in the picture after the Class of 2018 won 5 : 3 on Friday and yesterday with success 10 : 6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that this could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It hasn't ended until you've got points.
We have a goal to win a cup, so let's focus on it.
I have been saying all along, focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world –
He added: “I’m not going to be in a hurry to do things, because he’s content with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course.
Tomorrow it's all new obstacles.
Tomorrow it's personal performances, so it's different.
It's nice to be with the opponent when things go well, but if you're there in person, you'll be tested as a golfer.
It's a message you need to send to the players - give yourself the best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner, he's got to go and deal with it.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to act personally better than with opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received four out of three.
Furyk himself has experienced both of these last days, being part of the Brookline's victory team before becoming part of the defeat when Europe defeated the Medinah miracle.
“I remember every goddamn word, ” he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all his games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you must start hot, like in Brookline and like in Medinashi.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the central competitions.
We set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that makes us feel that we can be born tomorrow’
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run the competition and he's the best match with Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in that line because I think that’s how we’re properly covered, ” said Bjorn about choosing our individual games.
Germany's new warship failed again
The German Navy's latest expresser should have come into operation in 2014 by replacing the aged cold war-time warships, but this will not happen before the next year because of the damaged systems and the increased costs of the balloons, the local media reported.
The deployment of the new Baden-Wuertemberg class express ship Rheinland-Pfalzi has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the military press release published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems of post-transmission did not make it easy for the fate of this ambitious project.
Four of the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 replace the obsolete Bremen class expressers.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealing technologies such as radars, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to send out the latest rapid bursts for up to two years from home delivery.
However, the continuous delays mean that top-level warships - which allow Germany to strengthen its power abroad - are becoming obsolete when they enter service.
The failed F125 expresser was released last year when the German Navy officially refused to take advantage of the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy has sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after it was received.
The reasons for the return had little to know, but the German media quoted a number of important \"software and hardware deficiencies\", which made the warship inoperable if they were used on a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class is managed by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the senior Bremen class's quick-track workforce.
It was also clear that the ship was significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting its ability to add future innovations.
The 7,000 - tons - Rheinland - Pfalz - is probably twice as difficult as the same class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to wrong hardware, the cost of the project as a whole, including team training, is also a problem.
It has been said that it amounts to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion originally.
The problems associated with the latest rapid blows are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy will lose power.
At the beginning of the year, the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, acknowledged that the Navy had actually \"end of ships eligible for exit\".
The officer said that this issue has grown as a snowball over time, because old ships have been removed, but no replacement ships have come.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class expressers could join the Navy.
National Trust explores the secret life of bats
The aim of a new study in Scotland is to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for their food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future protective measures.
The study of the Scottish National Trust scientists monitors ordinary and sopranipipes in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-sleeved bats and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders shall be placed in the main places of the area to monitor the skin mice during the whole season.
NHS personnel and volunteers also conduct field studies using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all recorded media shall determine the frequency of skin rat noises and the activity of species.
A habitat map and a report will then be created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
The NTS Nature Counselor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the usefulness of managing habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat poverty has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flying papers and chemical treatment of some construction materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
The skin mice aren't really blind.
But their hunting makes their ears more useful when they catch the harvest than their eyes.
They use complex echo location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings in the whole country, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, is very serious about bats.
They have ten trained experts carrying out regular studies, surveys and sometimes saving.
The organisation has even established a first and only special bat-raiser in Scotland in Thrave, Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the 10 bats of Scotland live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says that this area is an ideal territory for them.
“ InThreave, we have a large area for bats, ” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still much to be discovered about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us to understand what they need,
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance activities on the property, as the undesirable destruction of one place of tinus and childbirth may kill up to 400 females and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
The skin mice are protected and killing, disrupting or destroying them is illegal.
The Scottish Officer Elisabeth Ferrell of the Nahkhiir Defence Union has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their weaknesses feed, ” he said.
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers plan to sue the German journal
Cristano Ronaldo has been rejected by rape charges as “a false kiss, ” saying that people“ want to advertise themselves, ” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who released the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape by American woman Kathryn Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He has claimed to have paid the women's population EUR 330 643,10 not to mention the incident, announced Der Spiegel on Friday.
In the direct video of Instagram, after hours of accusations by its 142 million trackers, Ronaldo (33) was reported to be “false-stamped, ”
\"No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s story is a false news, “he said five times to the news of the Ballon d’Ori winner.
They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and I'm all right, adding a player's smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for “an unacceptable suspicion of privacy. ”
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “injury of moral damage, which corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”
The alleged case took place in the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayor were allegedly returned to the hotel room where he allegedly was raped on the basis of documents submitted in Nevada by the Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent good man, ” of whom“one percent fail ”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it wasn't unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photos of injuries in the hospital, but later agreed with an out-of-court solution, as he was afraid of \"a special charge\" and was concerned about \"public humiliation\".
Now, 34-year-old women say that they are trying to reject the solution because the alleged case continues to traumatize him.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to the giant Juve with a deal of EUR 100 million to Italy.
Brexit: The COR can start to regret leaving car manufacturers forever.
The United Kingdom – for ever – would lose its position as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that the OSCE had told BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at a plant near Derby in Burnaston.
“We need a deal, ” said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of cross-border stops without Brexit’s agreement can be paid for jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where vehicles are manufactured in the Tokyo Auri and Avens, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we see a stop in its factory, ” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnastoni Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, concerned about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that the Mini plant in Oxford closes after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Tokyo production line works as necessary, where the spare parts come from the United Kingdom as well as from the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, may lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep a supply of more than one day in its Derbyshire factory, so production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers’ plan for future relations with the EU is “recalibly calibrated in order to avoid such border controls –
“We want the best solution that will enable us to do what we want, not only to make use of the current success, but also to make full use of the opportunity,” he said to BBC Radio 4 on Today.
\"The facts not only of the senses of the senses but also of the other producers indicate that we must continue to do what has been a very successful set of supply chains\"
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but in the long term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalari, a member of the Unite trade union, worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from experience that when jobs disappear, they will not come back.
The government press representative said: “We have put forward a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU –
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's major contributions to Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be postponed another week, as the fight against the highest candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein will monitor the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who will investigate the intervention of the Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the possible prevention of justice on the part of the President.
So if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General and thus threatens Mueller's independence, he's been pumping Washington rumors for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of interrogation tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing President 25 amendments.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, reporting he was about to resign.
Instead, a Thursday meeting with Trump was announced at the United Nations this time in New York.
Trump said that he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, gave them both hours.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, postponed the Senate vote.
Trump pressman Sarah Sanders showed up on Sunday at Fox News.
When he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been appointed, it may be this week, but it may be delayed another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it, and let's keep the press informed, as always,
Some journalists would object to this claim: Sanders did not hold a White House press conference since 10 September.
Commander Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to the frustration of TV journalists, although he added: “I do not object to the fact that they were disappointed.
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president puts more questions and answers in the session than any president had before him, “he said, without adding any evidence: “We have looked at these numbers, ” he said.
Info lessons continue, Sanders confirmed, but “when the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of this, and you've seen how we've been doing this in the last couple of weeks, so it's going to be at a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States of America,
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President may have demonstrated why, before gathered journalists appeared on the way out and sometimes with strange appearances.
The Minister for Health wrote to EU staff in NHS Scotland regarding the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for their post-Brexit presence.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to leave the UK.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of a well-established status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations have continued on the withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU, headed for its expected decisions in autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know it's a very disturbing time for you.
Therefore, I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Professional partners from all over the EU and elsewhere provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay...
Christion Abercrombie went through the emergency surgery after the head trauma
The supporter of the Tennis State Tigers Christion Abercrombie passed an extraordinary surgery after Saturday's injury and defeat from 31 : 27 Vanderbilt Commodores, published by the Tenlessee Mike Organ.
The head coach of the Tennis State, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury was just before the Polish season.
“ He fell on the village and just collapsed, ” Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side before she was placed on the canderam for further inspection from the field.
The Tensee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennis) that the Abercrombie operation in Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that there are no details of the injury type/definition yet and that the Tennis State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a red shirt, was at the first season of the Tensee State after Illinois' arrival.
He had five battles on Saturday before he left the game, which had a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp tax when purchasing real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax if they buy real estate in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist homeless people on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will destroy Corby's effort to attract young voters.
The stamp tax shall be levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to create up to GBP 120 million per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher stamp tax rate when they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help homeless people, reports Theresa May today.
The move is considered to be an attempt to defuse Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to offer them affordable housing and to target people with high incomes.
The Templar Tax is imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, targeting the government’s desire to fight homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to this stamp charge, including higher levels, which were introduced two years ago for purchases related to the second home and the development - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this move to create up to GBP 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the land purchased in London belongs to non-United Kingdom residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their own feet down.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “thorning cities, ” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices if they were buying land, but did not use it, and he called on May to give up on affordable home quotas in order to improve the shame associated with the Great Britain-Pacific.
Corbyn has announced the reform of the pampering residential economy, including rent control and the end of the exploitation of innocent people.
It also wants to give the council greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “In the previous year, I promised to commit myself as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
At the same time, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies abroad, to be equally easy to buy homes as people of the British people who work hard.
For too many people the dream of having a home has become too far away, and harsh sleeping conditions are the usual reality.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is Scotland’s management.
Sunderlan’s leader, Jack Ross, says that his “final purpose ” is to become the leader of Scotland at some point in time.
Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge of revitalizing the North-Estonian club, currently in the third place in League One, with only 3 points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Master League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached class B and it was limited, ” said Ross BBC to Scotland’s show Sport Sound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, and it is always something that has drawn me back.
But this is only when I'm successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as head of Sunderland have been Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear for such great and well-known names, having previously endured both in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, it is a success to be able to take this club into the Masters League –
Because of its structure and facilities, this club certainly belongs to the Masters League, “he said.
“It is not an easy task, but I see myself as successful only if I can get the club back there, ” he says.
Ross has only been a leader for three years, pre-supervisor of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearst's senior staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to level three and made St Mirren the lowest position as the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirreni and Hamilton Academy.
“ It was a real crossroads, ” he recalled the taking over of Allo.
“I really believed that management was better suited to me than playing.
It seems strange, because I did it, I got a reasonable income, and I enjoyed some of the best times.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm still experiencing this in view of my work's tension and pressure, but the management just seems more right.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and now I feel more comfortable now than I've ever been to an adult.

According to the study, it's best time for the surface on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the cost of pubs in British trouble, but greater pressure has been created for the restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, but restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the CGA representative of the Business Consulting Company (CGA), said: “A longer participation in world championship competition than expected of sunscreen and England meant that July was similar to June when pubs grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants became more difficult.
In June, 1.8% of reduced restaurants continued to deteriorate.
Drink-based pubs and bars were the most successful and the restaurants are the most popular.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurantkeepers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales decreased by three per cent,
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results will continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The effects of weather and major social or sporting events remain the greatest factor in sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
Long and hot summer would not have been able to come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time would indicate whether the moderate temperatures we have experienced in August provide some essential relief.
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trade mark-related agencies.
The sales monitor of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses 47 activity group performance data with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion and is an established industry benchmark.

The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them only 11 years old, created secret social media accounts that they cover for adults.
A study carried out among 20,000 gymnasts found a marked increase in “worst Instagram accounts (on the image-sharing page of the reference image-sharing page).
The news heightened the fear of posting sexual content.

At the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board, Eillith Doyle was elected non-executive Head of the Management Board.

Front pump advertising, comparing women to cows, shares the Internet with two
The breast pump company has shared two camps with advertising that compares the suckling mother to milky cows.
According to the talks, the first silent chest pump in the world, a consumer-oriented technology company, Elvie, published a similar promotion to the iron music video to present the freedom that this new pump gives to willing mothers.
Four real mothers dance at a table filled with hay with cows and sing: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see me on the tail, and “If you don’t notice, they’re not udders, they’re my breasts,
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, milk fill my ladies with milk,
However, advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has led to different online opinions.
The video viewers watching 77 000 times, and with thousands of comments, disagree, and many of them say that it illuminates the tents of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product was a very poor decision.
As we do, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that they are stolen from children by days after birth, ” wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not stick to the breast-feeding eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “I think it is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these children to promote the breast pump of the mothers who are still receiving them –
Someone added: Completely unscrupulous advertising “
Some are in favour of advertising.
“I believe this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy myself something like that if I was still feeding my breasts.
The pumping of milk made me feel completely cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but let's do it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product,\" wrote one.
Another comment was: “It’s a fun commercial for women who pump and feel like cows in their workplaces or toilets.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all danced in bras with non-visual pumps.
The idea of a campaign is that many women pump milk from the chest feel like a cow.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires, no pipes, and there is no eye on the breasts, giving women the freedom to move, to keep children and even to go outside during pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritable introduction.
With comparison between women's options for expression and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while at the same time presenting an extraordinary aspect of freedom, which the new pump creates.
It's not the first time the news has reflected Elvie's pump.
On the London fashion week, Marta Jakubowski’s mother, a visionary designer, appeared.
Thousands of migrand children quietly went to the Texas border tent camp.
The number of children in arrested migrands has risen sharply, although monthly cross-borders have remained quite the same. Partly because of the severe rhetoric imposed by Trump's administrator and the policy that has made it difficult with the assistance of children's sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and have feared to violate the possibility of their country being left behind, requiring the child’s right to care.
The risk was increased in June when the national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could produce fingerprints and provide data with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, an older immigration and customs administrator, acknowledged to Congress that a dozen persons who applied not to provide financial support for accompanying minors were arrested by the Agency.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrestees had no criminal record.
“At least 80 percent of sponsors or sponsors’ members are illegally present in the country and a large number of them are in criminal background.
So we keep following them, ” said Mr. Albence.
In order to quickly deal with children, officials enforced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being arrested. In the past, asylum workers said that after 60 days.
Many defend immigration before the judge by means of a videoconferencing of their legal content, come in.
Unsuitable to release shall be immediately dispatched from the country.
According to the asylum workers, and based on reports from the system published in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they will become nervous or depressed, which may lead to violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more current in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulty can be missed by the size of two eyes.
They added that moving children to a tent town without having enough time to get used to it, or to say goodbye to friends, could create a trauma that many are already in difficulty.
Syria requires the immediate departure of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem invited the Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, although the country has been in war for the eighth year.
According to Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, the external forces on Syria were an illegal act of terror and are dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions, he said at the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the Syrian anti-terrorist war was almost over. Since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue “to fight in this Holy War until we have cleaned the Syrian territory, both from terrorist groups and from any illegally present foreign power, ”
The United States of America has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting the Kurdish units and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
In France there are more than 1,000 troops from the war.
On the subject of refugees of war, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are appropriate and he accused the indiscriminate fears that prevent refugees from coming, spreading part of the West.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them face up, ” he said.
\"They are politicalizing something that is merely a humanitarian problem\"
The United States of America and the European Union have warned us that there is no end to war between the recovery aid to Syria and the opposition.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create the last rebel support point in the Idib buffer zone, has created an opportunity for progress with political talks.
The Russian-Türg Agreement prevented the widespread involvement of the Syrian forces in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem pointed out that the treaty had “clear deadlines, ” and expressed the hope that military action would hit the Nistra Front soldiers involved in the jungles, including Al-Qaedda, who were“ destroyed ”
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura will soon persuade the Committee of new members of government and opposition to plan the post-war Syria Constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem submitted requests for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why is Trump selected for another term of office
According to this logic, Trump could be won in the next elections in 2020 if his office's guarantee and scandal had not been completed by his presidential office, as it is probably the desire of liberal viewers.
What should undoubtedly be \"the most exciting end of the presidency\"
Currently viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour ratings have doubled from CNN to more than 1.05 million and MSNBC to almost tripled 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the peak. Compared to four years ago, the number of viewers has risen. MSNBC is being given the \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" by 3.5 million cable TVs to the viewers during the main evening news.
“This is the tension we are involved in because we do not understand it, ” said ABC, “Designed Survivor, leader of the government secretary, who becomes president when the attack is destroyed by a parliament building.
Nell Skovelli, who has experienced the comedy writer and book “Just the Funny Party: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, ” author, is another theory.
He remembers the pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The driver told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
“Why ” he asked
“He said he makes me laugh, ” said Mrs. Scovell to me.
All of this chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, not as shown on other TVs, Washington rumors can be fatal to Roe v. Wade's future and reuniting immigrant families and the global economy.
Absent is only the luxury of the viewers.
However, a six - hour presentation by experts talking about Bob Woodward’s basic background study, for his book Farar and for Paul Manafort 13 225,73€ of the pay-paying jaanalinnunahad Bomber jacket (Washington Post said about it “excessive self - confidence in clothing, ” and Stormy Daniels’s background ideas about Mr Trump’s anatomy orka description, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
I, for example, never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“One of his activities, which may appear to be a true life series, is that he shares something every night, ” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the director of the series “Panding Cities” – creator Brent Montgomery Trump’s performance with the direct actors of the performance and the sun’s plan (i.e. Norwegian with the NFL, Kim Jong-uni praise).
You can't keep an eye on anything, or you're out of time.
At Fleiss's home this week, he had 80 degrees warm on the north bank of Kauai, but he had to put in a room to look at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't give up watching Brett Kavanaugh run the Senate's Legal Committee and how the Supreme Court's fate hangs on hair.
“I remember how we used to do all kinds of crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization, ” said Mr. Fleiss.
\"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right \"
Mr. The Times Journalist Amy Chozick, Business, Policy, and Media, is a reminder by following the \"Hillary\" – author.
Other cash flows to the coolest White House intermediates
It is not surprising that division 17 of Pennsylvania receives cash flow due to the restructuring of the convention area by receiving two dominant companies at the same place.
As a result, Conor Lamb, who won a spot in the second district during the extraordinary elections last spring, proved to be the pre-number of the Pittsburgh District.
Lamb's opponent is Keith Rothfus, Republican, who is currently representing the previous Pennsylvania 12th Division, which in the major division overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were converted into anti- Constitution electoral areas after the decision of the High Court of Pennsylvania in January and therefore the old divisions were divided into anti- Constitution electoral areas, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th elections have saved the campaign, where the financial departments of the largest political parties are disposing of money - the Congress Committee on Democracy (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republican campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became well-known in Pennsylvania after a button won many views on the extraordinary elections of the 18th Congress Division of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been played by a Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won in division by 20 points.
Politicians have given democracy a small advantage.
USA El Salvador was punished for Chinese support and then withdrawn
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognised Beijing, a minor setback to Washington.
Mr Trump met with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017, and owned the Panama Hotel as long as the partners dropped Trump's management team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to withdraw from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama the US leaders of the diplomatic mission, because earlier this month, Minister Heather Nauert said that these countries had not recently supported Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was planned to be punished, which received EUR 140 million of aid from the United States in 2017, including the surveillance, development and economic impetus of drugs.
The proposed penalties, which included the reduction of financial assistance and the limitation of visas, would have been painful for the Central American State and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During their internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at ensuring security and economic prosperity in order to organise a leave to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent displaced people moving to the United States.
But in the middle of September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and to end the debate on any of El Salvador's penalties.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence, who will speak at a meeting in mid-October to talk about the government's views, is now being evaluated.
And three American ambassadors returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh announcements or punishments from Washington.
Mr Bolton's spokesperson for the White House refused to comment on the details spoken by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national debates at the request of anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst to the government who also spoke at the request of anonymity.
History of studies
Next, the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on the possible jurisdiction of Trump, for which there is a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also allegedly studying whether Trump's campaign relates to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress is to change the party, Trump will have to report back to the institution as if he were going to speak to the voters and perhaps even his peers judge.
There are a lot of weights here, and I do not want to point out that it is essential to ensure that Trump or his European counterparts are guaranteed.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the sustainability of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to turn against Hitler if only in the West had prevented him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Münich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-annual slaughters.
The history of such an undefeated march of turning points and democracy is about to get closer or it will delay.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires D.A. Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the spring water since he was announced last year that he made a motion for the secret recording of the President and speculated about the incompatibility of that post.
Rosenstein says The Times's statement is inaccurate.
“How do you respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable accusations of sexual assault and mistrust?
And above all, are we voting for Congress in central elections if Trump is to be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter holiday.
But I don't think we can, because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, who was tortured by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz, who once took over and used our ambassadors' homes.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me the tail of candle light on a table with a hammer.

Rangers Graham Dorrans is Optimistic before the Rapid Vienna Battle
The Rangers organises Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which was followed earlier this month by an impressive violin against Villarreal in Spain, puts them in a strong position to become the Group of the European League of G.
The knee injury did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans to perform the season before the first appearance of the season: 2 pins finished against the Villarreal game, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a jump table to get better results.
“This was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a strong opponent, ” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game and again at the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it's gonna be a difficult game because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people supported us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was difficult, thanks to my injury, and there were changes inside the club, but now we're all feeling good inside.
The team is good and boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, leave the previous season behind and succeed –
Women cannot sleep because of fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their husbands about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said he talked to his children about it.
“The people want family members to take care of them, but they do not talk about it at the same time, ” explained Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance.
This should, however, start.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare for the care of your family if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these options can be extremely important in relation to costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your counseler may be a good plan to pay for these expenses.
Your funding opportunities for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid life insurance policies with financial value to help cover these costs, or self-insurance, as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop any possible legal battles already in place.
Ask yourself to a health certificate to identify a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your request when you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the Trustee in relation to their financial support.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergy?
Write down these things so you can be ready if you need them.
“It is not just a financial side, but it is also important for those who would be doctors, ” explained Martin.
‘What kind of medicines are needed?

The oldest son of Track Palin, former Governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to the report published by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with the suspicions of domestic violence, in the report on domestic violence and in response to interference and arrest.
According to the police report, when a female person tried to inform the police of alleged crimes, Palin took his phone.
The award will be held at the Mat-Su Pre-investigator and will be held against the 500-dollar guarantee, announced KTUU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, where he declared that he was “not guilty, ” reported the news network.

At least 384 people have died since the earthquake that struck the island of Indonesia Sulawes on Friday.
A 7.5-chronous earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.

In NYC, federal prosecutors apply for a rare death penalty in the terrorist attack on suspects.
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the New York terrorist attack, where eight people were killed, and this rare punishment has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) claimed to have used the Home Depot rental car to attack the bicycle road along the West Side highways in Lower Manhattan in October both pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the report of the death penalty in the southern region of New York, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and caused serious body injuries deliberately in order to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, it is a possible death penalty on the basis of court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury charged Saipov with a 22-point charge containing eight murder charges, including blackmail, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal offences, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack was supposed to be “intentionable planning and planning, ” said the prosecutors, describing Saipov’s activities as“suffering, cruel and debilitated, ”
“Sayfullo Habibulavic Saipov caused injury, damage and damage to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Aleksandr Damian Pagnucco, ” says.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death trial of the Southern District Court of New York has been for ten years.
The guilty Khalid Barnes was convicted of murder by two drug dealers, but the result was a life sentence for him in September 2009.
The last execution of the death penalty was in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in New York in 1953, when the couple were executed in a conspiracy for the execution of the spyage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an indigenous wormhole, showed the lack of regret in the days following the attack and months of evidence of court documents.
According to the police, he had told the investigators that he was happy about what he did.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to commit the observed ISIS videos from his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the ISIS flag to be presented in his hospital room.
In a 22-point charge, he hasn't committed any of his crimes.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s national defenders, said that they were ‘seriously disappointed’ in the judgment of proceedings.
“We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty would prolong Patton’s trauma instead of the lifetime penalty without a chance of being released, ” said Patton.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed as the head of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today promised to protest at the Tory Conference during the “mobilisate the People's Army”
The former UKIP leader said that politicians needed to know the ‘hot ’ of Eurosceptics, because one of the members of Theresa May's own parliament suggested that they manage negotiations with the EU.
Mr. Peter Bone, a simple member of the Conservative House, said that the UK was already out when Mr. Farage was Secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs. May is facing the problem of reconciliation of deeply divided lines, highlighted by the Conservatives that favour survival, joining their anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with his Chequers plan to keep track of Brexit's supporters, remnant and the EU's attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the transaction with Brussels despite counter-acting and force Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and – chaos.
Bone said that when Leave Means Leave gathered in Solihull, he wanted to quit the \"Chequers plan\"
He recommended that Farage be a partner and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'He's responsible, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough added: “I stand outside for Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “In the world wars we did not fight to be subject to it.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that since the vote in 2016, the public opinion has now changed: “I think that the British people have changed their minds and wish to remain, is not true.
Tory Brexit’s supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “One thing in the world: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists, who actually go down the streets and even choose us.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening.
Mayle’s message added: “The ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises, ” he said.
Farage said that political leaders who were at the gathering should be “to know the hotest of them, when they plan to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.

“They try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that “we will not let it happen...
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to put our political class on the side of the Brexit betrayal uncomfortable.
“We mobilize the people’s army of the country that won us with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-government, proud Great Britain.
At the same time, the remnant marched through Birmingham before a two - hour assembly at the centre of the city.
The full-fledged activists waved “Toors against Brexit, ” creating a group this weekend.
In Liberal Adoni, the Conservatives were mocked by the Conservatives for the security issues that became part of their party's program to open the conference.
\"These are the people who say that IT systems can be established and the entire technology can lead Canada and more to smooth cross-border trade, without cross-border restrictions on trade in Ireland,\" he added.
“The whole thing is a fart.
There is no such thing as good Brex, he added.

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team records gave him a victory over Sebastian Vetel
From that moment on it became clear that Valtter's Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team order played a huge role in the race.
Bottas started a good start and almost ignored Hamilton when he had his first two times defending his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
The water was the first to stop the box and left the Hamilton group on its way to close traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to lead the next thing he was feeling when Ferrari's leader left out in a rough way to pass the inside side after the third corner tried to protect it with double motion.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back of the grid and was at the end of his first round on his 21-year birthday in the seventh place.
He then led the competition for most of the time, driving towards the finish of the rubbers and passing from Kimi Räikkönen to the fourth place.
He finally drove to the box stop on the 44th round, but he couldn't speed up the last eight circles, which gave Räikkönen a fourth position.
Today is a difficult day, because Valtteri has been doing a good job all week and was a real gentleman with me.
“The crew has done a wonderful job of having one of the two, ” says Hamilton.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump, at the meeting of Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, made an incident that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of raising Brett Kavanaugh in sexual harassment.
When speaking about Western Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate’s Committee of Justice, but rather commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people are “unfortunate, disgusting, and false, ”
“The only beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in a few days is that you see angry and angry, mean, disgusting and false people, ” he said.
“ When you look at the press releases and the leaks that you say: “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it...
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question: Did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak \"
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak, - added the senator's expression.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July on charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill reported: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story, ” he told Feinstein to the Committee.
“He asked me to keep my confidentiality, and according to his request, I did so, ” he asked.
However, his denial was incompatible with the president, who commented: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen.
By continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse of three women, the President suggested that the Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back the power without selecting the funds.
You see this evil and disgusting thing, and they don't care who they're hurting, who they need to cross over to get power and control over, ” said the president of the Media.
Elitliga: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giantsi Patrick Dwyer hit two gates against Dundee.
Dundee Stars won the Friday elite meeting at Belfast Giants, who lost Dundele 5 : 3.
Giants started to lead Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier at the gate with two gates early in the game.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the figs before Dwight took Giants back to command.

The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from the earthquake.
A Indonesian pilot was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure a safe take-off of hundreds of people.
The great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawes on Friday caused the tsunami, which later killed more than 800 people, many of whom have not been known to disappear.
The region is stricken by strong pushers, and many people are trapped in the city of Palu under the ruins.
Despite the fact that the colleagues at Anthony Gunawan Agung, who was 21 years old, escaped from the fluctuation tower at Palu Mutira Sis Al Jufri airport, he refused to leave.
He stayed on the post to ensure a safe take-off of Batik Air No 6321 at the same time at the airport.
Then he jumped out of the tower thinking it was gonna collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's press representative Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision to save hundreds of lives was reported by Australia ABC News.
We've got a helicopter ready to transport her from Kalimantan to a bigger hospital in the city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning before the helicopter got to Palu's.
“We were extremely sad when we heard about it, ” added the press representative.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to thousands. According to the National Disaster Relief Agency, access was restricted to the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the president of the Agency, said: “The number of deaths can grow, because the bodies of many victims are still under the ruins and have not been saved until now.
The six - foot [6 m] waves destroyed the city of Palu, where mass destruction took place on Sunday.
The military and passenger planes offer assistance and equipment.
The 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Ciirab will bring new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
A small market is being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is speeding up to help the survivors, but we can’t tell what they can find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and said to the State Army: “I ask you to work nights and days to carry out all the functions related to evacuation.
Are you ready to do this? Reported CNN.
In the beginning of this year, Lomboki, Indonesia, was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia’s accident: Air Niugini’s airline claims to have one man lost after the lagoon’s plane accident
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from a floating plane, the air carrier who was driving a Pacific lagoon plane in Micronesia claims that one man has disappeared.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon, they were unable to find a single male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the details of the passenger, such as questions concerning its age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the airfield of Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, but they were stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the air carrier and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon route.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the airfield.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed very low.
“This is very good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to reach the emergency exit in the floating plane in the water at the waist.
He mentioned that the cabin crew had a panic and a scream, and that he had a little headache.
The U.S. Marines and sailors who worked at a nearby quarry also helped to save themselves using a flooded boat to take people to the shore before the plane sank about 30 metres below the water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in air accidents involving air carriers registered with PNG over the last two decades, but none of them related to Air Niugin.
The analyst is preparing a schedule for the night she was burned alive.
On Saturday, the D.A. ended the trial of a retrial man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours analysing intelligence data as an expert.
He showed the jury the way he used cell phone calls to re-establish the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellise and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was in conflict with the young man's previous claims.
When you showed him that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and that's why he went to talk to the police in Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis “rejected because my car was in Nashville, ”
Another mismatch was that Tellis said he had known Chambers before she died for about two weeks.
The phone records showed that only a week had been known by the Nazis.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, in Tellis, Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were deleted from his phone.
“He erased her life, ” said Hale.
The defense is about to make its court talk on Sunday.
The judge said that he thought the case would take place in half of that day to talk to the jury later.
The High Breed: What is a well-known hiphop?
Hiphop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hiphop has withdrawn from the initials of his political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the hippie roots and make known hippo again popular.
The bands like The Fugees and Common have recently re-gathered popularity in Britain thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A New York nanny will file a racist message to the court after a couple of cases.
The New York babysitter appeals to the court for discriminatory dismissal after a few messages that were received by the family, where the mother lamented that the nanny was “a constant black person ”
A couple deny that they are racists, compared to blackmail.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed his regret when he learned that their new lascow service provider Giselle Maurice is black when he first came to work for the first day in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband saying: “EIIIIIIIIIIII, JÄRJEKORDNE MUSTANAHALINE-
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after his prognostic understanding of Miss Maurice, claimed that their social nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had waited for a Philippians instead of him.
Miss Maurice was paid one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now he appeals to a couple of courts to get compensation for dismissal, which he wants to receive daily $350 in the amount of the next six months, and the same work he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
“ I want to show them this way to look, so to do it, ” he said to the newspaper The Post, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.
A few have rejected the claim that they were racists, saying that ending employment with Maurice was a reasonable thing to do because they feared that they could no longer trust him after she was offended.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t think.
He's not racist.
“We are not racist, ” said the wife’s wife Joel Plasco newspaper The Post.
“But would you allow your children to hold on to someone you have been rude to, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on.
Commenting on the comparison of blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from birth and was “very difficult in the situation, ”
“Can you go against someone like that?
It's not very nice now, though, - added an investment banker.
Although the case is still under way, the public opinion has quickly condemned a couple of social medias, where they are severely evaluated as a result of their behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers feared that the readers would not communicate with the talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: “It is difficult to put herself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before she was published.
It's very fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington.
He said that his father, receiving inspiration to write a children's book on a small toy, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was due to the death of a father with a nucrous shadow last year.
As a member of the “very significant member of our family, ” he added that his father was silently proud of his final success.
“ He was quite a quiet man and was not a proud man, ” he said.
“But, since Paddington was so real to him, it was as if your child achieved something: you are proud of them, although it is not directly your achievement.
I believe he was looking at the well-being of Paddington in this way.
Although this was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged his own creation and imagination.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye by phone.
When he landed, his daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They regularly called to say that the condition of their daughter was very bad and that they did not believe she would survive, ” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nadia, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep beating his heart were slowly disappearing and leaving his body.
He was a little late before he died, and now all the systems started to stop.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, now mourning his daughter, to a plane with other passengers who didn't know anything about her experiences.
“No one knew, ” he said.
“ I kept my head down, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible loss of sympathy for Nad on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved him,
A grieving woman's postcards prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide rabbit work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have taped maps to the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call to support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13, when he suffered depression, and 18 years old when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any older parents to feel what I feel every day, ” he said.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile makes the room shine,
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he “was in a very bad place ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at that time, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Dr. Davis said: “I constantly worry that it has a domino effect.
Ms. Davis made these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even to, their friend.
Don't shut up - you have to talk
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Miss Davis's for years, lost Mark, together with his 15-year partner, not long after his mother died.
“ He did not say that he felt bad or depressed or anything, ” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during his first Christmas – when the children opened his gift, he had no eye contact with them or anything –
Ms. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “It will tear the wound into the whole family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must keep going and continue to fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a hair while the FBI begins the investigation
“I believed that if we could actually do something that he wanted – a limited time and scope study – we might be able to achieve unity, ” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would “fall together ” in the middle of the permanent blockage of the partisans.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to look into it?
Their frustration was due to the timing.
In just five weeks, on November 6, if the Republicans do not go well, they will be significantly weakened in their intentions to obtain the highest court of the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators by lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
The vote will take place in a senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea’s army runs “reduces ” under Kim’s government
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korea's troops in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-suug, quoted data from the Ministry of Consistency in South Korea, said that compared to the military oxides in 2011 (2706), their number had decreased last year (1127).
Mr. Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human traders.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korean citizenship has been offered to a large number of North Africans.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The majority of them escape through China, which has the longest state border with North Korea, and which is easier to overcome than a highly protected demilitarised area between the two Koreans.
China is more about illegal immigrants than refugees and often send them back to the country with power.
The North-South Korean relations, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of stopped nuclear weapons.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uni of the United States in Singapore, where they generally promised to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of lack of progress in sanctions.
“Unbelievingly the United States, our country does not have security, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to take up ourselves unilaterally as first armed, ” said Mr Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “supervisive ” and said that the man was unfit to judge the Supreme Court.
President of the Parliamentary Assembly, Nancy Pelosi, appointed Judge-in-chief of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaughd as “supervisor ” and said that the man was unmistakable to work as Judge of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi published the opinion on Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I was bound to say that if a woman had appeared this way, she would have been called hysterical, ” said Pelos, about her reaction, which concerned the testimony given to the Senate’s judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied that he had sexually attacked Dr Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, describing his family and high school years, he was almost screaming from time to time, and was sometimes put to word.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, calling the charges against him Hillary Clinton for the loss of the Presidential elections in 2016, organised by angry liberals as \"grotess and coordinated reputational murder\".
According to Pelosi, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man was not fit to judge the Supreme Court because it showed that he was being held up against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats, ” he said.
The fear remained modest when he was asked whether he would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from office if the Democrats were to become a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say so much – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he’s not fit in to the court where he works now, ” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Board of Appeal of the Columbia District.
He added that he was concerned about the decisions taken by Kavanaugh's potential Affordable Care Act (Health Act - Translation Act) or Roe v Wade (Legal Judge of the abortion – Translation Note) because he is regarded as a conservative judge.
At his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“It’s hardly a time when a hysterical person could become a judge and expect us to say that it’s not great, ” Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, a six- and-a-year-long hatred, and he can't get away with it without crying about it.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's unusual, or...
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was in charge of something; she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a method that stood by the fact that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘ You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry.
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant
The pajamas are partly accepted as an output of rage because they are considered fundamentally wrong.
One of my brightest memories is one of the early jobs in an office with a majority of men, where I once found myself crying out in unspeakable rage when an older woman – a strict leader, whom I had always feared – took hold of my collar and carried a stairwell.
“ Never show them how to cry, ” he told me.
\"They don't know you're mad.
They think that you are sad and that it offers them satisfaction.
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democratic Party Congress in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on the male presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart got caught on board a hunting boat called Monroe Business and finished the campaign, Schroeder was deeply upset that there was no reason why he should not think about running for president himself.
“ This was not a well - designed decision, ” he told me 30 years later, laughing at me.
“There were seven candidates, and the last thing they needed to do was to join someone else, ” he said.
Someone said it was like, “The snow White and the seven thumb boys, ”
Since the campaign was over, he was late to collect money, and he promised he wouldn't run if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to the men, gave him only $250.
“Do they think I get the benefit, ” he meant.
When he gave the talk that he did not launch an official campaign, the feelings received – thanks to the people who supported him, the irritation of the system that made it difficult to turn to voters instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism – he was so overcome that he had tears in his throat.
“ You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown, ” recalled Schroeder’s press reaction to him.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsorship.
I remember thinking about what they write on my tombstone.
She was crying.
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
According to experts, the gap between the US and China in the long term can be beneficial for Beijing.
This year, President Donald Trump of the United States made the first warning order by imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs of $200 billion (€150 billion) in value goods, basically introducing taxes on half of Chinese goods arriving in the USA.
Beijing has answered the same thing at all times, with five to ten per cent tariffs of USD 60 billion for American goods.
China has promised the US to respond with the wound, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to blink as soon as possible.
Getting back to Washington would mean returning to demands, but publicly worshiping the United States would be too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing’s cards are properly developed, trade war with the US can support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions leading to the loss of control over the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than bystanders have previously admitted, ” said a researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on research into Asia at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready for the return of refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for voluntary return of refugees and is asking for reconstruction of the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation in the country’s territory is much more stable and more secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government will continue to restore normality to the destroyed areas of the terrorists.
There are now all the conditions that refugees who have left the country voluntarily may return to the country because of terrorism, and because of their daily life and living.
According to the UN forecast, 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the start of the war since 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime was pleased to accept aid for the reconstruction of the degraded country.
At the same time, he stressed that the State did not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe has won Ryder's Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup Competition by defeating the USA team at the Le Golf National Golf Course in Paris near Paris with a result of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soils and has not won Ryder's Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was once again crowned when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team received 14.5 points to win the United States.
During the entire tournament, the star of the United States Phil Mickelson hit the track on the par-3 track in 16 water, giving up the victory to the Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in every round, becoming one of the four players who have won the tournament in the current 1979 format 5 : 0 : 0 : 0 .
The American Jordan Spiethile produced 5&4 of the lowest European team, Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, supported Ian Poulter from England with 2 and 1 who could have been the last one of Ryder's boyfriends.
Of the eight Ryder Cup Veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became 25,5 points of the career competition, the most won Europeans of all time.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the bear back.
It is a team spirit, and I am glad to be able to help, ” said the emotional Garcia who won Europe.
He's going to pass on to his fellow countryman, Jon Rahm, who won a single-time game in the U.S. golfer General Tiger Woods 2&1.
“I feel the extraordinary pride of winning Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him, ” said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all his four fights in France and now he has recorded his career in Ryder's cup competitions 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who have won 14 major competitions, leaving just Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team had a whole weekend to find fairways; the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the entire tournament during high-level golf.
After the disappointment of the team, U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of the guys, they’ve been so hearty.
There was a moment in the morning when we were putting pressure on Europeans.
We fought with them.
Murdered in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the US PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I feel proud to be their captain.
We're gonna have to lift the hat.
We were better played.
