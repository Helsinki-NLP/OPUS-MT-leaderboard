Camille Auer wanted to correct her sex, diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's making art on the subject - people should have the right to have her own body -
There are dozens of patient reports from the roof of Project Room Gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them reads Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a multi-annual story of how the people outside have written down their interpretations of Auer and its identities.
You've decided who he is for him.
I wanted to tell you my case-by-case history to make the process visible, Auer says.
At the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a period of years that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will start with the sending-on-party identity disorder - diagnosis studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen that he ordered via the Internet and was already very long in his own repair process.
She experienced being a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through the correction process so that sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the law on the adoption of the trans-national sex (563/2002) requires trans-national people to be forced into forced sterilization so that the right sex can be obtained, for example, by the population register centre and by passport.
At present, every gender correction is required for a psychiatric diagnosis and for a lack of reproductive ability.
A person has the right to choose his own body.
\"This situation is unacceptable and is an insult to human rights,\" says Auer.
The reform of the translaf has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to exercise their sovereignty.
The previous Finnish Government prepared the law for change under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There came elections and the Basic Finns rose to the government.
Now we're stuck with legal change again.
It is a matter of internal policy disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The administration does not want to raise it to the table because there are differences within the government with the law, ” says Frank Johansson, CEO of Amnesty's Finnish department.
The front part of the exhibition space is controlled by two major installations.
One is made up of packs and instructions for use of Auer’s medicines.
In patient reports, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpolic psychology of the University Hospital in Tampere from Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on this basis that should define the administration of Auer's justice and the provision of assistance.
The perception of the studyable reality appears to be vulnerable to the abstinence.
The studyr’s perception of himself appears to be fragmented in a cross-border manner and the unstable features of personality are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mental, Auer says.
Even more shock was when Auer was not given sexual replacement therapy.
According to medical staff, his resources were insufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpoli's waiting party across TV.
Later, the work of art was created on that television, called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
It's crazy that any person who was born as a woman can increase his breasts, but if you need a diagnosis to remove the breasts, Auer says.
Your body will not be yours if you experience anything other than your age as defined in birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of his qualities.
Gender correction is more severe for many spiritual reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its passings meet dozens of people who must be justified by their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, calling for their resources not to be enough, Auer says.
Many people applying for the process have behind the psychological symptom: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
In these circumstances, medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
\"Inhibition of care and assistance can feed a person into a worse situation than it was before the process began,\" says Auer.
The Auer's unique exhibition also deals with anxiety and suicidal thoughts.
In the publication text Auer writes: “I have had suicidal thoughts all the time in my adult life and that’s what people usually have to deal with.
The depression has been treated with drugs, and when Auer started using hormones, feeling made easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenager.
Why the broad jaw seemed inappropriate to the body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing to Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
Seeing is a basic treat.
It's time to justify that much by speaking, dressing, using voice and moving, he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing his future, and he is a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, close comments could have hurt a lot.
It's the most painful thing to do when the loved ones abuse you.
They should know, and they know who I am, but they don't, or they can't, or they can't, keep going.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body conflict, or body conflict, where body or body parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and the long research process, however, one cannot obtain official confirmation of one's own sex.
\"There is no medical justification for these studies,\" says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of a legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
A full-age applicant makes a written application for a new identity card, stating that he feels that he is a second-sex person.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new ID.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland and this requirement is also fulfilled by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The CSO gave a travel warning to Missouri
The National NACP on Civil Rights of African Americans has issued a travel warning for Missouri, which is the reason for the discriminatory practices of the state and the racist attacks that have occurred there.
\"NACP travel notice for Missour will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and invite African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to take utmost care when travelling to a state with a number of suspicious events recently involving race-based events,\" the Organization notice states.
According to the NACP, the recent law in Missouri makes it difficult for the export of cases of discrimination, and the implementation of state law is disproportionate to minorities.
- People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of the colour of the skin and being abused or killed, and Rod Chappel, President of the NACP, stated to Kansas City Star.
- We've never heard of one of many cases in as short a time as that.
The travel notice for Missouri is the first warning on the US state.
The organization mentioned, for example, the racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders.
Sanders died earlier this year, he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri police arrested him even though he wasn't accused of a crime.
The travel report also referred to the report of the Minister of Justice of Missour, which states that the police are more likely to stop 75 percent of the black driver than the white one.
\"The purpose of the travel newsletter is to encourage people to be alerted and warned by their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,\" says Chappel.
For example, people must be prepared to include money to pay guarantees or to tell relatives that they intend to travel through the state.
According to the F.B.I., in 2015, hundreds of hate crimes were recorded in Missour, the sixth largest in the United States.
Travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to challenge companies to live and work discrimination.
The ACLU, which was guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that are binding on the police to arrest people for immigration violations.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relate to other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension of the Executive Director
Mika Lintilä (centre) has been asked by the Minister for Economic Affairs for State Ownership (centrally) to report on the supplementary pension fee received by the airline’s CEO, Pekka Vauramon, Yle.
According to the Minister, it is contrary to the state's will.
The EUR 130,000 additional pension received by Vairamo increased this week, as the Helsinki Sanomat reported on the performance of the remuneration of the directors of the listed companies.
The magazine of Finland announced the additional pension for Vairamo in February.
Finnair told me that she'd give up on supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has directed that no supplementary pensions will be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the last year's ownership control decision.
We've got a lot of pressure on our orders, and we've got a lot of talk.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on their way from cold to warm.
President Donald Trump, who met at the G20 in Hamburg, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, seemed to be a great success.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions that were adopted last week by the US Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday were stepped up in Russia.
Mr Medvedev's reply has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which Trump's law of escape means a full-scale trade war.
Although Russian reactions would only be offset by political retorts and excesses, the tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short period of cheering after Trump's choice.
In the United States, it was not simple to go through the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
However, the Congress adopted the law with considerable unanimity, but the adoption of the law to the President was far more difficult according to what was reported.
Even though Trump criticises the new law that he signed, it means he's not enough.
President Trump's sympathies must have been the cause of Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting its own rights must have been hostile.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States of Russia's potential involvement in the presidential elections and the Trump campaign's Russia connections.
The tightening up between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short period of honeymoon.
Once the White House staff has changed, and various scandalous translations have been revealed almost daily, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not done in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the presidents.
Such a situation is in no way desirable.
If Russia's relationship is a blackmail in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the dynamic security situation in the core area of the Union is tightening up relations in the Baltic Sea.
The EU has clearly demonstrated the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least one side of Russia's policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For Russia, like Finland, much trade has been made in the Member States, economic sanctions have been real.
The effects of the recent US Sanctions Act are still unclear.
The EU is afraid that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
For example, the effects in Finland may be felt in Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennopower nuclear power plant project.
Ophthalmicity in Europe has been the result of the exclusion of sanctions, for example, an important liquid natural gas in the United States economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of demonstrating misconception in global politics.
However, financial sanctions must be well-considered and precise.
Otherwise, it'll be easier to do more harm than good.
Isn't there anything left to be holy?
The Trump White House now has its most purpose in the world.
It's a sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as the rest of it: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, fell into the statue of Saddam Hussein in the square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trump regime, knew very well what was going on in an angry debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta.
Miller didn't really appreciate the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have attacked the huge flocks of cruise organizers and imaginative characters of the Freedom Pact.
His attack was focused on the importance of the statue, and in particular on the addition of Emma Lazarus’ poem in 1903 after the completion of the statue.
Thus Miller set Acosta: “I don’t want to go any further into history, but the patent of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original Freedom Patriot.
Miller wasn't wrong about himself, but it's not just history, as he himself said.
What is essential is Lazarus's touching words, the only quality in which the state does not just call immigrants but the most so-called: \"You were, your poor, / Your hundled masses were saving to breake free, / The wretched refuse of your teaming programme –
The poem is now more timely than ever.
He made it clear that the poorest are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The debate on the importance of the Freedom Pact is part of a broader political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’ friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to his statue’s feet, and they knew well that the act was a strong political act.
The aim of the statue was to reflect the connections between the French and American Republic with a classic symbol of freedom by female incarnation.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female character is no longer an abstract, it has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name, a deported mother.
The connection of the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American citizenship.
Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to its original.
Rush Limbaugh – a designer, now regarded as some kind of a prophecy about Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Freedom Pact is not being called to anyone, but it is an early pioneer of the Conservatives who will take the United States to the dark to cover the world: \"Lady Liberty stands out.
He's taking freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
It doesn't look like a way to the United States.
A few, yes, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of freedom depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants after a long and challenging journey from the ship’s deck.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for a better life.
His Holy Father comforts by giving him hope and by welcoming him.
And that's what Miller and Trump never want.
Their ringing doesn't look like a road, it's the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Cup in Sports 2017: Neil Black Praises Scottish Members of the UK Country Team
Eilith Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got to the Great Britain County Team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the United Kingdom General Sports Association, says that 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in World Championships are markedly confirmed.
In the World Cup in London, the number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Championship.
According to Black, something special is happening in Scotland, from which the British public sports must learn.
This is welcome, and we're going to continue to study it for so long that we can understand what it's about,\" Black says.
“The representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they believed that it was related to the Institute’s activities.
The Scottish General Sports Union believes it is related to the activities of the Union,
and the British General Sports Union believes that it is behind their activities.
And a regular streeter thinks he's got something to do with it.
But there's something going on here that's amazing, what's going on?
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for real medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah for 5,000 metres in running. Eilith Doyle, in turn, was elected a team captain.
- He's too modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, Black says.
“The athletes were proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they were living and practicing.
The words of Eilith were true feelings and passion for sports.
Eilith Doyle is a national championshipist in a 400-meter fence race, and these are his fifth World Championship, and he thinks it's unbelievable that the national team has 16 Scottishs.
The previous record was from seven years 1983 and 2015.
The average travel runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records over the year.
He competes in London at 1 500 meters and 5 000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs at 1 500 metres in London. It is also worth keeping an eye on: a man has an excellent season behind him, including winnings in the UK World Cups and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only Scottish team on the ground team was Lee McConell.
The national team captain says he's very proud to be involved in so many Scottishs, some of which are seriously competing with final locations and medals.
“At the same time, access as a Captain is a great honor, but it is even more special because the members of the team voted for the captain, ” says Doyle.
Of course, I'm very proud of all the skis that got into the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They're involved as paid athletes who compete for prizes.
Captain's speech?
I thought it went well.
I was focusing on how lucky we are when we have our home contests.
It is important to enjoy the support of the public at home and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere is gonna be amazing.
Preventing critics on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you do not withstand criticism
Our father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic politics always in his political principles.
The criticism must have been agitated,
But he did not silence his critics.
If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led by stupid and quieter than sheep for slaughter, Washington said in 1783.
So that's how we get to Governor Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The U.S. Alliance of Civil Rights challenged Hogan's trial earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge to be unfounded, and the attitude was not only a matter of online approach.
This is just Facebook, so many comments.
But it matters.
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the state controlled by the Democrats.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not a sensitive reaction to hot hair.
He has managed the state firmly and firmly adheres to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication to his voters and published a picture of the state of the art in Chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users coming to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum, which his staff maintains with tax resources.
According to Hogan's informant, Amelia Chase was defending the governor in his interview with Washington Post.
However, it is too easy to identify commentators as trolls, pickers or haters.
Washington Post interviewed users on Hogan's Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They said that their comments were respectful, considerate, and relevant.
In his comments, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, from Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile, but asked a question of hate crimes.
\"I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken the view of hate crimes and other recent news,\" he wrote in comments on Washington Post's news.
\"I also cannot accept the fact that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately regarded as an organised group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens,
The governor's staff called comments as a centralised assault, someone else could call them \"the most important things\" to promote.
During the Facebook era, communication is easy to control by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, people should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical manuscripts, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But really, it's the same thing, now it's just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
He's been sued by Twitter users blocked by President Trump.
The first major decision was taken in Virginia last week.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris, the district government of Loudoun broke the first increase in the US Constitution by preventing a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Alliance of Civil Rights visited the discussion with the Republican Governor Matt Bevin on Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
During Washington, low-cost postal payments had a similar effect to today's Internet.
The number of newspapers doubled from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous writers were screwing up Washington.
That's when there were trolls.
Names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote in newspapers letters calling for Washington's decisions.
The President's office received petitions criticizing the Jay agreement, namely the United States-UK Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Affairs Agreement, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the core stones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
We should stop the summer food of birds right away.
The samples have come from about 40 locations, and also online reports of two, three.
Most of them have come from southern Finland and Varsinais Finland, but then they are also individuals from Haapavede and Seinäjoki, special researcher Marja Isamursu Evira.
Green beads are dead to a superstition called trichomonosis.
It's caused by a science called Trichomonas gallinas in the original animal.
It has previously been known to hit the pigeons, especially the pigeons.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also observed from Peippolins.
In 2009, he had a good run.
Then, in Finland, the trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the greening stock, after which the species’s positions have been perpetuated.
There have been sick green beads now, but not yet in a large scale, the Museum Master Juha Honkala of the University of Helsinki (Lumus).
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green spots will be renewed again unless something is done.
What must be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the birds from summer food immediately.
I'll see you later on.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-field promotion at the Renaissance Club.
The former European player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field promotion for the next three days, when he organises the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament at the Renaissance Club East Lothian.
Last year, Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led the tournament in Archerfield Links, a neighbor, before the last round, but finally disappeared to Paul Eales. Rafferty has liked a new place and acts as the ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it's going to be perfect,\" Rafferty says.
The players see the field at their best.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great event for this field.
The English Eales defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won a 32-year career for both the European tour and the European challenger tour.
This seems like a really special occasion,\" says the player in Southport.
\"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open's victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back to me: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a wonderful time to always remember.
Gary Orr is going back into real action on his own soil, and he went on tour after 50 years this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
The Orr in Helensburg is always more relevant than usual.
- You want to succeed, but you also know the extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far.
Three will be followed by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Champions, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament is attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs 5 pounds if there is only a driver in the car, and 10 pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All income is donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Possible indoor air problems of the cashier
At least so far, there are no internal air problems in the box building of Pori's Brigade’s communications company, the Brigatt was reported on Thursday.
In-air studies will continue.
The reports began when a man who suspended his military service for health reasons thought that his health had been reduced due to the bad indoor air of the carrage.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other military officers.
It turns out that the case was an individual incident and that other servants of that unit have not had any health problems.
Each declaration is taken seriously and we wanted to make a thorough analysis of this issue.
At present, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, Holma says.
The Brigadet's report states that because of the entry gap in July, the boxes must have been moved to the boxes and therefore dust may have increased at a moment.
Because of this, air may have seemed intruding, Holm says.
Poverty and death in the golden land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use the heat of his cooking.
Even Katila is rarely used.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in Indonesia’s restless province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the Batatine – locally – directly into his fire.
In about half an hour's time, the burnt potato will be eaten with an unwashed, unwashed hand.
There are no furniture in Dege's home, sitting on a muddy mat where he usually treats his daily scans as well as laundry in the dark water applied for from the nearby swamp.
The office of the village will be delivered by a bucket in a dead room.
Degei is one of the four wives of his youngest husband, and no fields are assigned to him.
Marveliality is common here.
Later working can be dangerous: most of the village's men are unemployed, and many drink a lot. Also, we need to take into account the soldiers.
Nobody dares walk in the village after five in the evening, Degei says.
This is a rare squealing on the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch coloniality, which was included in Indonesia in 1969, the accession was preceded by a controversial referendum, with 1 026 village elders being forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch power, quickly turned its anger to the government of Jakarta, which keeps the region strictly under control and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The enarotal is remote and the coin. The journey begins with a half an hour flight from the province capital in Jayapur to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive to the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
Some 19,000 inhabitants in the city have woodlands surrounded by the Bamboos, where rusty rust is dyed as bellbrows.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the People of Papua Mee Pago worshiped the Ugandan Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
\"We didn't have these clothes,\" says Degei. \"He means a colourful, hand-creaked ginger head, dark skirt, and bright-colored sweater.\"
All we had before was magazines covered in our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 percent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, with child mortality and illiteracy as highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The panic is about a upper area of New Jersey with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about a hundred kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine brought Freeport 3.1 billion dollars of gold and copper.
Papua also has an estimated 78 billion dollars of wood reserves.
But to the Babylonians, these riches bring misery, for they mean the instigating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military staff and military local units nearly 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
Papuan’s demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income, and they are silenced with mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed over 500 000 clergymen and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
In the 1970s, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass deaths in the upper tribes of Papua have reached the dimensions of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 people in peaceful demonstrations in the area.
There are reports of the brutalities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks, which are particularly popular – and unrelenting attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
\"The number of Uhrs is difficult because there are weekly cases,\" says Andreas Harsono, a Human Rights Watch researcher in Indonesia.
Ruuvia has been blackmailed when the natural resources of Papua attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the population structure is changing from Indonesian settlers in the islands of Jaava, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes to move Muslims to the region in the hope of better living.
Jaava warung candies sell fried chicken and gado-gado-false blends in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
\"Abeth You, 24 years old, has come from Pania, and has moved to the capital of the province,\" says Abeth You.
The local women lost their clients.
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo – his favorite name Jokowi – promised in his election campaign for 2014 to address the injustice of Papua and human rights violations.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former woodensmith won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta's President-in-Office.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to fill our hopes and restore justice, ” says You.
Some kind of wave base was found only two months after Jokowin’s local civil servants.
The eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
Scared children told soldiers that they should use headlamps.
One of the soldiers didn't like the remark, and according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the victim and witness reports, drunk soldiers captured children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later the building of the State Election Commission, located near the location, was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand clergymen – young men and women and children – met in the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They were accompanied by hunting springs for feasts, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago, where they danced in circles and followed the bird song.
Some of the protestors began to stone the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere became hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: \"If the crowds are fighting more than three times, shoot them to death, the knowledge is based on the official document seen in the TIME magazine, which has not been published to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident leader of Kego Koto, reportedly to be out of control of the situation and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist, he told TIME magazine about his brightly painted wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the lines of the soldiers.
- There were multiple shots fired in the village.
Alfius Youwi was shot three times and his cousin saw the shootings.
“I ran to him and made sure it was him, ” told Yohanes TIME magazine sad. Like many Indians, he only used one name.
I saw him dead... kissed him...
I'm here with Chief Inspector Yotje Mende telling the reporters that the police were just protecting the police station because it was under attack.
\"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,\" said Pudjo Sulstiyo, the journalist at the Papu Police Department in 2015.
It's about life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The next day was Jakarta's death report.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapur, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the violence in Papua.
I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch reports on human rights violations outside the legal system.
But he started to cancel his speech right away.
-A large part of the infringements happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and the early 21st century.
The important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but it requires certain processes, he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind.
- We'll find out everything in court, he told us.
The UN blames Wiranto for crimes against humanity: The crimes are linked to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody declaration of independence in East Timor in 1999 Wiranto told the TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events of Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania are misbelievable.
I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not advanced in any way, Yohanes says.
I'm tired of this.
He still tells us he's alive in fear, even though it's been years.
I'm scared, he says.
I'm afraid I'm gonna be shot.
His brother, Yacobus, confirms that the Persians are afraid to discuss the event.
He says that soldiers had abused him when he had helped bury four victims.
The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are buried, he says.
The ammo hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in a nearby area of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the construction company manager, which started when the manager refused to take a man who lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man who had to be treated for the hospital was a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been in possession of water while fishing in a nearby river, who died on his way to the hospital.
The hated villagers showed their minds on the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned cops who responded with warning shots.
However, according to the local authorities, the paramilitary police force in Indonesia opened fire per crowd when one of the villagers was killed.
We're afraid of revenge,\" says Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded brought in.
- I've been hiding at home for two days.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots of police officers to be held accountable and to be withdrawn from the area by a moving police force.
Pania has always been the problem of the Government of Indonesia.
The real lack of development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the wheatlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua release movement (OPM), a rebel army who claims to defend the Spanish rights by random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian military soldiers.
Some of OPM leaders are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and prosecuting thousands of people in Pania in the name of safeguarding national sovereignty.
Some of the arrests will never return.
Among the Papuans, Panai is known as a place known as “wild, forgotten, ”
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There's only a little rice in the enarotal for sale, and it's too expensive for the locals, too.
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweets and some fruit and vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman's responsibility can be four or five Batat games.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten Batats only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in local and migrants’ livelihoods have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to locals better for trained and wealthy migrants.
Only a few Papulais have sufficient capital and knowledge to run their own businesses competitively.
\"You don't want to stay in the village because there's no job or money here,\" says John Gobai, president of the Pania tribal council.
The world will be distracted by the unscrupulous Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international news remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua even though they had been given a rare licence to describe.
According to Dr. Phelim Kinen, Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises; he has not increased transparency and has encouraged development by removing restrictions on news.
“Indonesia’s most unrest eastern provinces in Papua and West Papua are exposed to new risks: the refusal of visas and the entry into the black list,\" Kine stated in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of action in the press means that only the neighbours of Papua will be pressured by the Government of Indonesia.
In March, the six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s numerous and widespread violations, including the Pania shooting.
These countries have also traditionally supported the liberalisation movement of Papua.
Arrmanatha Nasir, rapporteur of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, questioned the allegations and told journalists in Jakarta that \"Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering the evidence of human rights violations would be difficult to cover.
Local governments want to see foreign governments missing.
When the official Dutch delegation, led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapur on 4.5.2017, the locals violated silence and expressed their desire for freedom, reports the anonymous permanent source who took part in the meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections 2019, but the Palestinians tell us that Jokowi will probably no longer vote.
Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are involved in the Pania shooting, says Gobai.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the Persians: they live under the control of the greedy and unpredictable army in poverty and poverty, practically without health services and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, the panicans, like the other parrots, hold the voices they gave to Jookow as a debt that must be paid back.
They just want justice, he says.
Despite the threat and fear of the victims of the Pania shooting attack, the relatives once again showed a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the military office.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let responsible ones forget their crimes.
- My family member was killed, Yacobus says his head is in a nightmare.
- What else can we do?
Dereck Chisora barks about the cancellation of Robert Helenius' replay: \"Even your own fans don't want to see...
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora, who were the boxers of the heavy series, were to fight in Hartwall Arena on May 27th.
However, the fight was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In an interview with IFL TV Chisora, the reason why the rescheduling is completely floping to the shoulders of Helenus.
My interview in Finland was a flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my opponent in Finland.
Even his fans don't want to see him get involved because he sucks, Chisora gets bored.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the fight with a controversial score.
The ticket sales were silent, and Nisse Sauerland, its promoter, told East Sanom in May that the match had been moved to autumn.
The fight hasn't been any new since then.
However, it is no longer the harm of Chisora.
In any case, the fight would have to be withdrawn after Chisora's illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in heavy pain.
My girl was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora tells me.
Britti says she's in about 45 percent condition right now.
He's not interested in a re-election match with Helenius, but in the aim is Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered loss in December.
It took me over again in the Torch pilot in Dubai.
The flames took over the world's highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents had to escape from a 337-metre 79-storey building.
This was already another fire within two years in a building called Torch, a bell.
The building was empty and nobody knows it was injured. For the reason of the fire there was no idea immediately after the event.
We were asleep, and we woke up with a fire alarm, and people's screams.
We ran down stairs on the 50th floor, which took ten minutes, and the resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Authorities, the fire was shut down from four in the morning for local time and left for cooling the building.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for those who had left their home.
The case may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torch building carried out a study that found that the most damage was caused by the plates used for public service curtains and isolation.
In Britain, the police believe that the insulation and curtain plates of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid progress of the flames in the fire, where 80 people died in June.
The parking place in Joensuu was stolen during the night.
The parking lot in Joensuu was stolen on Tuesday between 21 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take banned items into the aircraft, reveal the survey
The survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited items knowingly or without knowing about aircraft past the TSA checkpoints. At least six per cent of passengers had knives or other steel items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent told me that they had only later learned that they had been carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives in the error.
The survey was answered by over a thousand passengers, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to threaten the rules.
19.7 per cent of passengers who deliberately violated TSA's rules were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15 per cent were members of the X generation.
The most common rule was broken by taking food and fluids to the plane.
More than three per cent of them deliberately admitted to an aircraft with steel, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had taken banned drugs knowingly into the aircraft.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken smuggling supplies past security checks and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that those who travel most are also the most likely to pass the security check – knowingly or unwittingly.
However, as the company that made the survey says, TSA’s instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what fluids can be taken and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the TSA's seizures are liquid.
For a while there was also a belief that no books should be taken into the aircraft.
You can take fluids on flights to your home country but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Agency for the Environment, swung his decision to delay the decision taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions
The day after the challenge of 15 states to the law of Scott Prutt, director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce the emissions of smoke in the Obama administrative period.
According to the Minister, the change shows that the agency he manages takes better account of the needs of the State’s decision-makers in the field of the environment.
No mention was made by the Pruitt of an action brought before the Federal Court of Appeal against his previous decision.
The States Parties should begin to comply with the 2015 standard level of ground ozone as from 1 October.
In June, the Prutitt announced that he would forward the implementation of the decisions by the year so that his agency would have more time to examine the plan, as the Agency does not want to interfere with local decision-making or harm economic growth.
Pruitt was a general prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA, known as the opponent of stricter environmental rules.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind in the middle of the week is the latest setback for the Prutit plan to reduce the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted a decision that the Head of EPA exceeded its mandate in attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama Government decision on oil and gas companies.
In a Wednesday evening's opinion, Pruitt claimed that, in relation to the ozone rules of his full version, EPA's cooperation with the states was only strengthened in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
“In previous administrations, EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to challenge the right to reach an agreement on timetables, ” Pruitt said. In his previous activity, he challenged the law of the Environment Agency more than ten times.
\"We do not believe in regulation through trial and take time seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its powers to us.
However, the EPA opinion concluded that Pruitt may continue to exercise its powers to delay the implementation of the decisions and other legal powers, in order to ensure that the provisions are justified and based on the best available information.
In Congress, Republicans drive a wider change of ozone rules.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
This week, the New York State Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who sued the EPA, said that the group was going to continue the pressure.
\"As a result of our complaints, the EPA's change will be a major gain for the 6.7 million new Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smoke build-up in their communities,\" Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the complaint involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
The ozone of the ground is generated when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil mills and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
Thus, the smoke stream that is born can cause serious respiratory problems for susceptible groups, and it is also involved in thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmental defenders welcomed the surprising shift in the direction of Pruit.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make a fellow similar to our breaths sound sense, ” says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
\"We must fight against Trump's regime, as it is ideal for us to act on the terms of the polluters and other self-interest groups.
The supercar manufacturer's coming down the street with a Ferrari-style thing.
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while seeking to hold onto its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it's Ferrar's style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about plans at the information conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year, when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automobile News news.
All cases of cancer in East Savo with the same virus type
The THL has the same virus type as the previous cases in East Savo.
The virology laboratory of the Institute for Health and Welfare has ensured on Thursday that the fifth infection of East Savo is the same virus strain as that of previous infections.
The THL has ensured that a person on the shoreline on Friday 28 July has the same virus type as the previous cases of East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections in East Savo relate to the first ashes found in the region of June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not seen other types of cancer virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may occur between August and August, and therefore the epidemic is not over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for the primary health disease of Soster.
There have been no new ashes inspection or suspicions since the fifth confirmed case.
Still, however, it is important for everyone to take care of the timing of their own vaccination shield, Erkila recalls.
Other topic: three new cancer diseases in Pirkanmaa were confirmed - extra infections or epidemics are highly unlikely -
Finland prepares for the creation of a licenced film
It wasn't even considered legalizing.
Based on the argument that the process produces, along with the booze, methanol, which is toxic.
It's legal next year, but legalisation of the porridge is not even considered.
The shields are made by means of exercise, and again by distillation.
Tislaus regulation is based on the justification that the process, along with alcohol, produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the soup for every man's right, Ismo Importing from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of the Pontika was not considered to be legalised.
It was not brought to the political table either.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Congressman Outi Mäkelä (Kok.).
He is at the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of government parties who took a stand for reform of the alcohol law.
Even the application can continue to be granted a permit for distillation at home.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Importing is said to be a simple rule for the home preparation of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be made at home by means of visits.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine at home, you can legally make a race.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements of flavourings and flavourings and enables the film to be produced, Mäkelä will specify.
The manufacturing process must remain so that the raw materials or the flavouring and flavouring ingredients produced during their consumption are clearly in the process of drinking.
According to the new law, drinks can be made as much as they want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
You can't keep putting it on for sale.
It is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Importing believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when the imports of passengers from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol presentation is now being checked by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcoholic will be handled by the Parliament as soon as the killing season begins.
The sitting is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like the Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä will rejoice.
Oscar Pistorius was congratulated on being sent to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who had been affected by breast pain, was thanked for heart attacks at a hospital in South Africa.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is suffering from his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison informant confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
In turn, the Pistorius family informant said that the former top athlete was in order.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the sixth-time Paralympic gold medalist to prison for six years on the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered telephone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
The literins of telephone discussions between the President of the United States Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked to Washington Post.
During a telephone discussion on 27 January 2017, Trump invited the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speech about the fact that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States called to Nieto for the fact that this was an outrage of the wall project.
Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promising to build a wall at the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published the first call from Trump to Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnboull. There was an intense exchange of words during his speech.
According to Trump, the agreement that the United States would take refugees on its way to Australia was a \"death\", \"death\" and \"typey\", the agreement negotiated during Obama's period would make him look like a \"idioot\" because he proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped the call to tell Turnboll that this was the most unpleasant call he's ever made all day.
Georgia's massacre: Activators redeployed racist lanternism in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury-marked car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in Georgia countryside and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the team, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath of his chest and crosses through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
-Roger, the man's a babbling.
\"Out of the car,\"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-establishment that was presented on 22 July 2007.
However, the squabbles of the shock are real when a hanging loop is inserted into the neck of Roger.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to redefine the events of 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan dumped two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested in these years – although murderers are living among us and many people need to know who they are, ” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the reconstruction arrangements.
It's a disgrace in history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs our soul.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congressman.
To him, reintroduction is an eloquent call for action, and it also reminds Monroe's residents that injustice has never been corrected.
We want the guilty to be brought to justice, and we want things to be finally completed, and we want to get back to grief and make a settlement, but above all we want justice,\" Brooks says.
- We can't recover and settle until we get justice.
The medical examiner covers the body of the dead victim in the massacre in Georgia 27.7.1946.
According to the FBI records of NBC's news, over 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of being suspended.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists have always known the motives of lanternism: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Blacks of Georgia were given the highest right to vote in the presidential elections for the first time. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred during the election, where a black rental farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
Brooks said that Hester was having an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to FBI records, the powerful white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid $600 to Malcom, on 25.7.1946, bailed him out of prison.
On the way home with Malcom and Dorothy were their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The force stopped their car before Moore's Ford bridge.
It turns out Harrison ordered and ordered the murders, the FBI's report says.
It's also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities.
Brooks says it more closely.
- It was a right-of-occupancy murder, he says.
\"They were murdered because they wanted to inform the black people that they would have the same thing if they were going to vote,
Cassandra Greene has guided Georgia's massacre for almost a decade now.
The performance is extremely realistic and imprisonable, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already been lost in the United States today.
It's hard to look at the show, but it's even harder not to look at what Greene says is meant to be.
\"We don't want to talk about the lanternity because we have to face our own dark side,\" says the director.
But if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through,
On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – met to listen to Greene’s routine summary.
Wade Marbaugh works as Greene's assistant director.
He has presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the reintroduction for years, but the role is always just as difficult and hostile.
It's gonna be dirty because I'm not myself, Marbaugh tells me.
However, it is important that this aspect of history is also held in motion so that it will never happen again.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona are practicing, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom yells and pushs Hester, and he's pissed off that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
Didn't you hear me?
Rascona or Hester will answer.
Then we're gonna hit.
And then all (at least all black actors) will laughter.
Greene laughs harder.
- Rascona's asking.
He's confused.
- Did I accidentally get too hard? - He's asking.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I just don't think the whites used the word \"n--i\" at that time.
Yeah, the second black actor confirms.
You have to use a longer version.
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the power of the room is the spirit of a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the performance, but because they want to respect the memory of those who have died.
The scene begins at the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are dirty.
No one laughs.
The reintroduction will be over quickly and violently.
Rumors, shots – and silence.
A woman dressed at the black funeral stand by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks with every other word.
A few ten meters away, fifty viewers wipe sweat and tears out their eyes.
Almost half of the audience are black and half white.
There's a couple here to see a show from Ithaca, New York, but most of them are local.
They've been guided by Brooks on the victims' graves in Georgia's pressurizing humidity.
The murders have turned from the story into reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song show, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children are able to view artificial blood and immobilized bodies and whisper at each other.
They're not really dead. A little boy's gonna be like a reminder of himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who presented the swings take off their sign and wipe out tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man he proposed by the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after a tough show.
It's all right. A woman who was involved in the show will make you feel better.
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and actors meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple from Altanta is very busy discussing the show with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski is hard to find words when she describes the feelings of the performance.
It's hard to listen to the terrible words and watch the terrible things that people say and do, people who look the same as you – precisely because they look the same as you, he says.
- I noticed that there's still some kind of leaks going on, he added. - They're just called arrests.
On the other side of the room Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for hearings sitting on the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's performance.
\"A reintroduction is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it's also a teaching experience,\" Brooks says.
The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who don't know their history are condemned to repeat it.
Growing up in stores is a source of shock: With the removal of excess parts, it really saves
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the flower bear already in the store before weighing?
And what about taking a big hat out of an anaesthetic? It's gonna weigh a lot, right?
The answers give a strong opinion: for one, it is an indication of the extreme influx of sleep, while others do not want to pay for the parts that do not use and do not, however, go to the trash at home.
They'll be able to identify the scene in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket district of the Ruoholahti in Helsinki, because many are tearing away, for example, some of the leaves of the flower.
From the box, the papers are being sold to bio-waste.
According to the news published by the Houses, falling asleep with a vegetable stylist is a shock to the merchants.
But how much does removing extra pieces of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is it?
We women test how the price changes when you take off the leaves or the heels from the anana, the latva, the sensitisers, the broccoli and the flower.
Cauliflower: €2.00 paid the price for the flower is €1.80 when peeled all the leaves.
Ananas: The price of the total ananagna cost of EUR 2.30 dropped to EUR 1.95 when it was turned away.
The price of EUR 2,60 came to EUR 2,40 when the short position was cut off.
Peaches: Two treats cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the stocks, there was a price of 60 cents.
Parsley: The medium-sized broccoli cost EUR 1 and without a weight of 80 cents.
Final result: If leaves and stocks are to be cut off, saves a few dozen cents at best for one vegetables.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables decreased by up to 20 per cent.
Therefore, these purchases would have saved a total of EUR 1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the Brass Star concluded a five-year contract with the PSG
A five-year contract with the French football club PSG has been signed by Brazilian performer Neymar, reports AFP.
Previously on Thursday night, representatives of Neymar had paid the FC Barcelona withdrawal price of EUR 222 million to play football in the Spanish league.
The €222 million transfer amount is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
Spain rejected the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar's representatives.
The company that buys according to the league rules cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out the contract itself, which is done by recycling the money via the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives, who supplied the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Ames on Saturday.
Uefa will look into the details
In addition, Barcelona reported that it would provide information on the payment to Uefa of the European football Federation in order to enable the association to determine any disciplinary action that might result from the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected that the PSG would break the rules of Uefa's economic fair game.
Uefa can punish a consequence of a loss of over EUR 30 million over a period of three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its financial position.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the company's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players in significant amounts, reported on Uefa.
The PSG owns the State-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The former tennis expert, Nasser al-Khelaifi, was chaired by the Society.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, got a lot of heat from the lightning attack, and the flash went into the security camera at the airport.
Austin Dunn was about to take standard measures for an airplane at the Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of fellow workers, when suddenly, from a rainy sky, the lightning struck the plane.
The power of the lightning threw the plane into the land of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said he was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking him if he was alive, and his sister, Austin's sister, Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
Besides the burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was hard on the whole family.
You don't know how to wait.
It's traumatizing for all of us, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on top at the time of the incident and the transport movement itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British Training Group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced that he would again cut the costs by 300 million pounds in May as part of his third saving programme, aimed at reinvigorating the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of Penguin Random House to his partner, Bertelsmann. The company announced that he would like to see this year's view unchanged. Its net sales increased by 1% in the first half of the year and was GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Attacked in Kabul: NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber struck a military situation in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul. According to the authorities, NATO was killed and many others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in an attack in the Kabul Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in Herat in the Musketeer.
On Monday, two people died of suicide bombardment at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, Thursday night explosion occurred when the joint patrol of NATO and the Afghan army ended up carrying a single-made explosive device as a target of the attack.
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and treated at Bagram airport in the US military hospital.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS Terrorist Organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people killed a car bomb in a suicide attack in Kabul in the region where they mainly live Shiiamuslim.
Taliban reported to me that he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in a bomb attack in the centre of Kabul, which was the country's most devastating militant group attack after the US-led troops were beating the Taliban power in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan, when President Donald Trump is considering sending more troops to the country to assist the local army and police.
According to the reporters, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also significantly undermined people's trust in the government, its policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghana.
The EPA shall withdraw its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke-free rules.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in turn, decided to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke-related emissions during the Obama administrative period on the day after the 15 states had challenged the Agency’s right.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called \"specifications\" for 2015, late on Wednesday, which shows its commitment to cooperation with the states.
\"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states,\" said President Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, the Pruitt announced that the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, the smoke rate is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution is to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, 15 States mainly governed by the Democrats, including District of Columbia, were sued by the Office.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought ways of mitigating the environmental regulations of Barack Obama. According to Trump, the measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The Trump measures have been opposed by the Democrats and environmental defenders who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, ozone-containing air breathing may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the leading character was also sending the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The reservations indicate that the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us more about why the company stopped.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas-discharge device and to take the device to a full public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
Managing Director of Neste: Renewable fuels did well
The result of Neste, the oil-distributor, fell before taxes, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year’s comparable operating profit improved the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Livos, the operating profit of renewable products was maintained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though tax relief was over.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will be able to complete our strategic investments earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in the newsletter.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko are discussing a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match for the near future of the series of less than 66,7 kilos, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms in ESPN sports facilities in Los Angeles until the WBC's undefeated light series champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet the master of the Lomatchenko, WBO's superior steam series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the show with the unanimous decision of the former four weight-class world champion Adrie Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the top five on a list of weight-class boxers.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, \"How you doing, master?
Good luck to you.
Lomatshenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel seven Saturday.
When the twin posed to the photographers, Lomatšenko Manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be perfect in terms of:
Well, I'm an old steam shower, Garcia reminded me.
I moved a series above [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a little six and a half pounds.
I want to go back to the light series.
He must rise into a light series [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's do their wish.
Lomachenko agreed.
-Support needs this fight.
Klimas asked whether the match should be organised on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatšenko, according to which Lomatšenko debytoit in a light series later this year and will be taking next summer against Garcia (37-0.30 in the event of a shock win). Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will take a light series in Forum on 23 September.
\"The fight could be on the pay channel because fans have asked it,\" Garcia said and later announced she was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
- We're the most interesting names.
Nobody else gets that much attention.
As soon as we get a deal, I'll be fine.
Garcia said that she appreciates Lomatshenko as an unbelievable fighter, and that she might be going to see Saturday's game.
Lomatchenko interrupted the boasting of Garcia and said that this three-weight champion from the Riverside looked like a real slow one, sorry, Mike... but you needed that knock-off...
Garcia said that he was first focused on the demonstration of force and then boxing.
The men said that they felt that they wanted the fight between them more and more.
This is the game we're expecting.
No other fight will attract as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case, Garcia said.
Lomatshenko said he was expecting to fight the best.
It's gonna be a great fight.
The average wage of EUR 5 300, the training of which happened - the situation of investment advice - wild and free-
The quality of investment advice has been a lot on the table lately.
Last time, Helsingin Sanomat told us about Rita, 68, to whom the banker’s investment advisors spoke in full about investment products when selling.
Investment advisors and different rules for the sale of investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of next year.
These increases are based on the new Financial Market Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
The assessment of the skills of investment advisors and investment firms is currently based mainly on self-regulation.
There is no definition of knowledge requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment service perform their own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has been an authority to organise qualifications for the APV investment studies Oy, a company which is also engaged in financial supervision (Fiva), as well as experts from universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are developed by Aalto EE, which provides business management development services at Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are quite wide in terms of requirements.
Studies include 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV investment studies Ltd, reports that the pass rate of the exams is roughly 70.
Of the largest banking personnel, in particular, all investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 because their performance is mandatory according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bank credit companies without mentioning the names of the staff whose staff is affected by the conduct of a map of qualifications, says Savikik.
He said that this kind of banking business has changed.
According to Savikko, the APV1 degree has completed 13 000 to 14 000 people since 2000 and an estimated 3 000 APV2 qualifications are recommended for investment advisors.
Some banking residents consider the completion of a degree to be an advantage.
Many other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Savík says that the Financial Recommendation requires APV qualifications to be carried out, as it is when investment expertise is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros on average per month, including commissions, nature benefits and earnings.
The average earnings per month for regular working hours are approximately EUR 5 300.
The men working on the job make an average of EUR 5 900 per month and women make more than EUR 4 500 on average.
An average of around EUR 8 100 is worth the tenths of the earners.
The tens of the men making the most earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of the women making the most money earns EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Until now, self-regulation has been trusted at the level of the employee and the task force.
According to Fiva, individual cases in which the professional qualifications and competence of an investment firm were not adequate on the basis of the work of the adviser had to be accepted.
In principle, the seller of investment products can also operate even if skills and qualifications are at a delicate level.
In this regard, the situation has been wild and free.
Many other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements, says Savik.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, this will be achieved by tightening up the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
In turn, financial supervision should be authorised to impose what needs to be done.
Fiva market supervisor Marko Hov reports that one of the clear changes to the current regulation is the requirements of the know-how and experience of investors and investment products sellers.
According to the court, the new requirements apply both to investment firms' own staff and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court says that according to the Government's proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may be authorised to exercise competence and experience.
From what they are exactly, these visions will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company will also have to continue to take care of the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and further training.
All this needs to be documented, and the company has an obligation of proof of this fact that this has also been done.
The court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the personnel’s image at individual level.
This will certainly require different levels depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced in the due time, if the skills or experience is insufficient.
In other words, if a company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who fulfils certain time criteria.
Under the court of change, the rules are tightening and tangible.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of 2018.

The plane’s flight route was drawn on top of the United States’ Flightradar24 service.
The flight was performed on Thursday by 787 Dreamliner, which tested the sustainability of the Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane that left Seattle flew within 18 hours and 1 minute a distance of 15 700 km, which is longer than any regular commercial flight in use in the world.
The flight remained within US borders throughout the trip.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra’s sinister beach swimmers do not delay rain or sun roast - Ines Kakkonen polski with tightness in swimming bath
Ines Kakkonen made his progress at a good pace, Taina Ikken followed.
Imatra Coastal Schools run around Litete and Lempuka for this and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, young swimmers are not a moksi, boasts the leader of swimming schools Taina Ikkonen.
In this week's bathing skills, a total of 13 children, next week a dozen.
The fact that the school and the eskar started to start at that time was influenced by the number of children in the coming week.
Imatra Coastal School is organised in collaboration by the Department of Connecting Project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, on the beach of Liette, there was a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shined and the young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with swimming pools, someone already without.
The smaller brothers and sisters were also enjoying the water.
Enes from Kakko, 5, first suggested going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to kneel towards the beach.
It's going great!
He told me he went to a lot of swimming this summer.
He's got a good beach for the litete.
Innes, like Kaikinen, with a swimming pool, trained the swimming pool with a tightly trained Vili Huhtän, 5.
You too will be satisfied with the achievements of today, the swimmer praised.
Jami Kallio, 4 times he wanted water wars.
Her daughter Anna Villberg, who followed 6 swimmings from the beach, Ilona Villberg considers the beach swimming school to be a good start for learning swimming.
Even though the weather has been really bad, every day Anna's been happy to leave here.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school kids packed on the dock.
The boys had enough to get off the beach with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luuknen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread to the dock towels, siped fruit, and baked the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush on the dock.
It's like when you don't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet drills.
You see it all kinds of stuff.
A couple of days ago, the Blue Product, which produces cleaning products, launched a series of unknown military products.
I mean, dishes and laundry bags, and a \"wc- tap on the edge brush,\"
An unknown soldier refers to this autumn's premiere film and film marketing.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been decomposed in social media: When will the coming unknown health ties occur?
I need to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Vice President Aino Määt say?
We're partners in the movie.
We're here to support this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says Määtta.
According to him, there will be a special movement for the products and thus the film will become visible.
Isn't there something funny here - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is this connecting story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, says Mätta.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish basic values as those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
And cleaning isn't for military culture. It's not for a stranger. It's for a man to point out.
Other partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Salodo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall's vichys have been placed on the market, known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unidentified products were already perata suomen kulelehti's blogist Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film first night, so we still have time to go.
For unknown partners, their war products have not yet been exposed, for example, by Valio, the Breeder, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers’ age-tests were published
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published, and the results of the new tests carried out with the evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were more than 18 years old, but not all considered reliable.
The Swedish National Medical Agency started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be further evaluated as the age of the asylum seeker, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was assessed that it had failed to determine the real age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far carried out 6 880 tests, and the Legal Medicine Agency has now released 2 481 tests, and tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
The 80 % tested, i.e. the 2002 asylum seeker, was determined to be more than 18 years old.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the applicant for asylum is - possibly under 18 years of age -
The tests were performed only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age of the applicant to be notified.
Johan Göransson, the ombudsman Medical Agency, says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
The figures are rather consistent, and the large differences in previous months' statistics are not noticeable, he told The Local magazine.
Although a large proportion of applicants were defined to be over 18 years of age, it does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 of the results of the test and announced that 442 cases were - there are indications that the study is 18 years of age or older -
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used for testing takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinese Institute, whose work includes an evaluation of human biological maturity. It is possible to determine whether a person has had a break earlier or later.
\"I have had reason to consider this, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine when we're old, we shouldn't pretend we can do it, he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Agency for Legal Affairs, defended the accuracy of the tests: \"In general, it can be said that the risk of determining the child as adults is small.
The highest risk is in a situation where the test is to be carried out in 18 years, with a risk of about 10 per cent and a risk of about 10 per cent.
Ilone collapsed 30 places in Scotland
In the third round, five more than par results were spent by Mikko Ilosen on 30 points down to the golf European tour in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday, instead of 11 divided, but was found at the end of the round to divide the 41.
Ilose was raised in heavy coils with three bogs.
It was hard for others, too.
Ian Poulter, England, rose up to divide the top place under the par, even though he told us that there was enough work in the lengths of the umbrella.
Keli was raw, but I hung with him and finally the day was good, Poulter Tuum.
He's sharing the lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia to exchange party
On Thursday night at Trump's campaign event, Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced that he would change the party.
\"Democrats simply rejected me,\" Justice said.
\"Today, I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough reflections, \" today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats,
The audience broke out in fresh applause.
- As a member of the Republican Party I registered tomorrow, Justice added.
As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game.
Trump promised earlier that an important announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice didn't support the Democrats' candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father the mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published an opinion that \"the political exchange of Governor Justice is again a new attack on a democratic party, which would rather build obstacles than better America\".
“Democrats only have 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice’s announcement is the latest setback for a party without any leadership and unable to find a positive message that unites people, ” says Ronna McDaniel, a representative of the RNC, in his statement to CBS’s news.
The lightning has sown the damage - Thursday is coming up even summer's very busy day
During the rest of the week, we can also add thunders to Southern Finland.
During the past week, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomen.
The night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning attacks set off several fires.
According to the Meteorologist, Thursday may be a very busy summer day.
The Ukrainians have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais Finland.
On the table, lightning struck a line house in the electrical center, causing a small fire.
The Rescue Department received a report of a fire about 15 minutes until midnight.
The power station was located in the sauna room at the end of the row house.
The rescue facility can discharge the roof and the wall to find fire extinguishers and shut down the fire quickly.
The total of eleven apartments were non-electric, but the personal injury was avoided.
On the holiday, lightning set the outside building on Harjuland before midnight.
At the time the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue facility could not stop the fire from spreading.
The outer building of about 50 square feet burned to the ground.
On the way to the Kuopio in Rääkkylä, lightning struck the homehouse again.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed the strenuous lightning attack.
The rescue facility was there to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get the fire earlier, only a few molten flies blew.
In traffic, the thunder caused problems on the train path between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning attack damaged the traffic control system.
Data on the fault was obtained on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was only fixed a little before the fifth afternoon.
Since then, rail traffic has been able to continue normally also with a thunderstorming section.
The lightnings have sown the damage across Finland.
However, the climate has been relatively small this summer.
These thunderstorm stories of this summer have been quite impoverished! estimated by the Air Science Institute's sundae meteorologist Jari Tuvinen.
During the mid-week and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but due to the limited lightning yield in the summer it seems even powerful.
This might seem really hard on you, but that's what it's been, compared to this summer's thunder,\" Tuvinen says.
Wednesday, the landscapes were blinked 1 700 times, and on Thursday there was a potential even for the hardest day of the summer: around 16 o’clock, there were 1,790 lands on the ground.
If the climate continues on the way to the beginning, then more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, That predicts.
The previous year’s record was found in 2015, when the number of lightning was around 30 000 pieces.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning rate had risen to 18 386 lightning.
So there is still a lot to be done to ensure that this year does not break the two-year guaranteed record.
However, the Ukkoskir can expect to continue.
According to the newspaper, during the final week Finland will also remain warm and wet, which is an acceptable birth environment for married people.
The main focus of the Ugs will be on Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where some 2,000 lightning days can be reached both on Saturday and Sunday.
There's a more uniform rainmill in the middle of the country.
That's what Tuvis says it's just a few.
Coe boasts of Russia's open mind - an apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world's sports boss, thanked him for describing his apology, which Russia made because of the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to put an end to Russia's ban on participation.
The Russian general sports director, Dmitri Shljahti, said at the IAF Congress on Thursday at the World Cup, that the ban given by Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to fight Doping.
He said he was sorry - on behalf of all the athletes who were taken to competitions for gold or silver medals -
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the public sports competition in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office WADA's report presented evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
\"I think his response today was very direct, and it was a very open-minded presentation,\" said Coe, President of the IAAF, to the journalists.
\"All the Council and Congress were satisfied that the Russian General Sports Union granted the country's difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganise its activities.\"
Coe also said that Russia accepted the conditions for deciding the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Group’s recommendation that now is not the time to put an end to Russia’s ban, ” Coe said.
In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system, he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of neutral athletes at the World Championship in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAF.
On Monday, IAAF’s leader, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
\"The test remains insufficient and the trainers who have received an operating ban continue to function freely,\" he told journalists on Friday after a presentation to the IAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed with the weak success of Tom of Finland.
Tom of Finland did not succeed as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If I'm honest, I'm disappointed to admit that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorf, CEO of Helsinki Film, in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that a Finnish movie audience might be conservative, and it seems to be.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100 000 viewers, which is the film's budget, about EUR 5 million.
This is not a lot of money, but it is important that investors get their own money back.
If the movie had been better in the country, they'd have already got their money.
Now we have to wait for small bites of foreign distributions, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukosken.
How the economic rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of European football euro do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive transfer of players in all time.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will decide on the European Football Regulatory UEF, which can prevent team participation from the esteemed Masters' League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules for fair play, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
A further EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and the annual salary of Neymar in the new association is moving to tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG does not have any difficulty in paying the Neymar transfer amount and attaching him to its star maps, as it follows from funding the Qataran oil-rich ruler.
The associations will be allowed to use large amounts to buy players, but they will need to be balanced with real income sources so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for the fair game were drawn up to chair UEFA at the 2007 French Michel Platinum initiative.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners took their support.
In 2011, the focus of the economic rules of a fair game was on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea for the first time in 2003. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums to buy players and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of assessment of the fair game’s economic rules lasts until 2018, with a maximum loss of EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave the roles of UEFA president scandalously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, also wants to control the unmanaged spending of clubs.
“The rules of a fair game are still in use, and we will also apply them in the future – and Andrea Traverso, responsible for the financial rules of a fair game in UEFA, told the Associated Press News Office last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a one-off payment, it can reschedule the amount in its accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so that the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expenditure of EUR 44,4 million for the next five years.
Based on the economic rules for fair play, the first sanctions were allocated in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, financed from Abu Dhab.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the association was also ordered to limit its Master's League to 21 players for the 2014-2015 period instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors euro that may try to circumvent its financial rules by increasing its income through companies linked to the owners of the association.
If, for example, the Qatarian company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, the UEFA does not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar tourism agency to PSG was over-measured.
It has also appeared that some of Neymar's merit in the PSG could be financed by the payments made by Qatar's World Cup Organization for football in 2022.
However, the PSG and the Organisational Commission have denied that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the World Trade Organisation (PSG) had been taken from Neymar and UEFA could be very easy to disclose such a arrangement.
As a result of the earlier PSG sanctions, UEFA is more likely to monitor companies in more detail by circumventing the rules.
On Thursday, the sources on the situation said that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press News Office on condition that their identity is not revealed because they have no authority to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, the net sales of PSG over the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and the operating profit was more than EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
The PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and to increase the sales of club products and shirts.
The Authority estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30% as part of the Neymar Agreement.
Spain, who was clearly agitated by the departure of the world's best player, tried to make it difficult to move Neymar, which was claimed to break the economic rules of a fair game.
“This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state, ” said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, and he referred to the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger also makes reservations about the state financing the football club. Arsenal owns American sports boys.
\"The death is a consequence of the ownership that has changed the operating environment of football in the last 15 years,\" Wenger said on Thursday.
It's all possible after the state owns the football team.
There are so many kinds of interests that relate to the fact that a famous player represents the state.
Now we are in a hurry: Finnish MM athletes coached in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahden and triangular coach Kristiina Mäkelä, Suren Ghazaryan, is stuck in Helsinki even though he should train in the World Cup of Sports in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
The Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the armpit of the long jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in the armpit of the triangle.
However, the two coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this issue without results at the British Embassy.
The coach has the call of the MM contestors as a document, but it has not been able to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, the coaching director Jorma Kemppaine said.
He has always dealt with visas himself successfully in the past, but now there is a problem.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone is looking at the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said about the possible exclusion of his coach.
MM Medal for FinlandLontous requires a miracle
The World Cup competitions will start in London on Friday and last for a fair week after Sunday 13 August.
Public sports, landscape skiing and hockey are the species for which Finnish bench athletes are able to be passionate about the year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the heart of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the prizes to the other, where experience will mature the performance of athletes to the level that the MM-metal of adults is genuinely possible.
Now the Finnish small MM team does not have such young athletes, nor does it have co-cars.
The MM Medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, sport’s interest and surprise are that wonders may also happen.
It pulls bench athletes over the TV screen and glues to follow the races, even though London medals are not solved until nightfall due to time difference.
From the previous World Cup in Sports 2015, Finland received one promotional medal.
It was brought by the flyer Tero Piktämäki.
Believers are waiting for a medal from the Long Mountain, even though the other will tell the results of the last few years of his and the other throwingers, as well as the staying of the Long Mountain in the prize race last summer.
In these races, however, Pitjäki remained in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes access to the final competition or to make their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and believe in the realistic medals of Finnish public sports over the coming years will be a good success in youth's international values this summer too.
The processing of young people's talent and the financial support of their work are more important than keeping a small body of representation athletes.
Success will not be immediate, but will require years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that London's races will remain in history as the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not for example because of the fear of terrorism or the violent attacks.
But I'm sorry.
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's cots are the best in Rukajärvi's big-earned world cup.
The women's race won the U.S. Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump on the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and the good guy is now, but I'm afraid the last jump didn't go all right.
I'm going to try again in the race from now on, Tuumin Rukajärvi.

Viking Line’s new quick ship hard to get to Helsinki
The fleet company Viking's new long-range FSTR is very late for schedule.
The ship was supposed to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6: 00 p.m.
There were eight countries of loading on the ship.
The ship is already late for Helsinki.
At least for a half an hour, I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the vehicle is moving a little, the Estonian John Rebane, waiting for access to the ship in the port of Helsinki, told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical problem.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting for their cars to get to their ship.
The Viking Communication Manager, Christa Grönlund, tells IS that a technical fault has occurred on the platform.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's return trip for a few hours.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
The 42-metre special transport interferes with traffic on the Kuutosti Thursday night
There are 42 metres of special transportation moving from Muko to the port of Mustola during Thursday night.
The nine of them should arrive by midnight.
Police are driving traffic on the Kuutosti, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
I remember transport going down the road 13 through the port of Mustola.
Small District Sisalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Deceive
At the same time, both the days of the '80s' glory and the '90s grunge' (at this time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State for MTV) and their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and the other stars of the series moved to bigger things in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parade and a description of the continuous reminder we have been stuck to during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived its time.
First Day of Camp was surprisingly well, and not only because of his absurd humor (including H. Jon Benjamin’s style of vegetableism).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors act as passionate fellows approaching adult age, highlighting it makes part of the impossible to reach the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parade is more fragmented: for example, there are 90s of stalker movies, such as horror movies, the Hand that no one dares.
In one point, one of the characters is digging up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skaters and other stuff from 1991 to 1991.
Many stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showwalter) is now a writer but still has not reached over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there is a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (as Michael Showalter) as a criminal partner, George H. W. Bush (who plays correctly as Michael Ian Black).
As always in a series like this, the best are the side paths.
It's especially fun to see the twin-shoe Paul Rudd, who has a beard-up under the lower lip of the bottom of the head, Matt dillon's-soul patch, singles. Andy, the shoes of the camp, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may be raised to this series as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends go to Wet Hot American Summer first night.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series appeals to a different form of nostalgia: the Cold War of the Americans series, the Atom Blonde film and even the GLOW series, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has created Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where the Bukarestian cop fights for truth, atheism and Marxism.
As a hard-faced Gregorina and an idealist Iosefina are seen in Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Uliki. They have dubbed in English by Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (polies spend time watching TV chess in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a bunch of famous recording actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, who get a fun game of bongaining them.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in tracking the socialist drama of the clumsy, for example, the killer hiding behind the Reagan mask. Therefore, the series often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long and the humor of the series is not fast enough or heavy.
As a result, the series could be better agitprop-satier, even when Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly attending the US Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby with hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary Communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were afraid of our own recent history and their history as well.
The Kouvolaan Toni Taurus rises in the ring in Macao - the former UFC fighter
Toni Taurus wants to keep the fight up.
In Macao, Toni Taurus receives a hard bone because Leandro Issa, a Brazilian player, was still in UFC last year.
The Brazilians also have the black belt of jujujutsu and the World Championship of the species.
One day, I'm going to fight my parents.
It's a funny thing. It's a 32-year-old Taurus.
The Kouvolaan had to get in his ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistics problems, but three struggles were brought on a short-term schedule for the Chinese self-government region of Macao.
Taurus has never met such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It was annoying because preparing and training took a lot of time.
The contestant is, however, pleased that a new date for the struggle was reached.
Waiting for a week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer will not affect the condition, because it will not recover in a week.
The condition can get worse if you're practicing too much.
In a few of his previous struggles, Taurus has faced opponents whose strengths are in stand-up.
This time, things are different.
Oh, my God, the Kouvoliman describes me as a typical brasilial.
He's a rather aggressive fighter.
I bet he comes in first round hard and tries to take the carpet.
He's won the world championship, so he knows how to go.
The previous fight in Kouvola was not going as planned.
Kevin Belingon, from Philippines, hit Taurus badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so hard, he didn't get a hit.
When I went down the road, he hit my eyebrow.
It's been a long time.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters get used to it once a year, some get up in the ring more often.
For example, the future opponent, Issa, had a previous fight in September.
Taurus had three fights last year.
This is the second year's struggle ahead.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I've been training in the last few years and I've been in good shape all the time.
But all I've been doing is fighting.
When a 32-year-old heard about the coming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training, and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got some really good workouts when there was this guy from Sweden.
There was a great help in this exercise, for on Saturday the Kouvolaan will be prepared to engage in physical struggles.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice standing up.
It's a 32-year-old's main tactics.
We've got to hit him rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll be on my way to the property myself.
Lower exports must not be given for free because they consume the most.
Macao's agitating the Taurus that he's been fighting in China before.
I hear it's from Las Vegas, China.
I think there's a big, nice night ahead.
The Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep the interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been unpopular and that the rate of inflation has stopped speculation.
The Bank of England has warned us that economic growth is continuing at a slow pace.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Committee on Monetary Policy decided to raise interest at 0.25%, which received even less support this month because economic growth has been unpopular.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank decreased its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 per cent, and it also warned that more pressure on the income level of households would be needed, as inflation would be expected to rise by three per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates are needed over the next few years to control the inflation that Brexit has set, and the Bank also announced that the loan costs could have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which was started one year ago in the subsequent reports of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is expected to offer EUR 15 million more for banks through this programme, i.e. a total of EUR 115 million.
The protocol on the Bank’s interest rate decision states: \"The Board’s forecast for financial policy is that the slow development of GDP will continue in the next few years when the decline in real income of households reduces consumption.
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for some degree of tightening of monetary policy in order to control inflation - the expectations of the market more widely -
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases were - i.e. balanced and cross-border -
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7% for the next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
There was a drop in the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the weight decreased by 0.5% and stood at 1.31 dollars, which decreased by 0.4% and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep the interest rates unchanged was made after the expected weaker growth rates decreased the expectations of the interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but to be slightly shrinking at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation review gave only a little hope of rising inflation and low wage increases for households, and the Bank says that the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent a decline in income in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to recover significantly at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The sector will also be strengthened by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak threshold, which will reverse part of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rates were calculated at 0.25% after the outcome of the EU referendum, which fell to a fall.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start to appear at prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the most recent decision by the central bank, interest rates had been reduced to demand more and more voting when inflation pressure on households was tightening up, and three decision-makers in July called for a 0.5% interest rate.
In the last month, inflation rose to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the upper limit of the two percent target was due to a weak ceiling.
\"In view of the recent decline in swap rates, competition on the mortgage market would seem to increase even more as creditors apply for customers in a hot way and want to end the year strongly,\" says Andrew Montlape, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
“Markkinnas look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to end. The renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also costly options –
NHS prescribes 10 000 anti-HIV medicines in dispute
Since September, patients may be prescribed a \"reversible\" anti-HIV medicine, and the highest law concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the medicine in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention therapy (PREP) is prescribed for approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Justice passed the Supreme Court’s judgment last year, according to which NHS was able to pay the PrEP medicine, even though it claims that it should be financed by the local authorities.
Simon Stevens, Head of the NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday for a significant new intervention, and the National AIDS Organisation described it as an important moment of urgency.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield begin first to receive registrations for an experiment extending to other clinics in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) therapy must be taken prior to co-administration with an anti-HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV exposures in risk groups.
The medicine to be taken before sexual use means that the body will have enough drugs to prevent HIV exposure.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target treatment group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics select the conditions for experimentation to meet the conditions of the applicants for male, female, and transversal women and those whose HIV positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy.
People living in England and registered as a general physician can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million, and this week the NHS of England signed a contract for medicinal products after an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementing treatment.
\"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV,\" says Stevens.
This is another major achievement in the fight that has been going on for more than 30 years in order to resolve the health challenge of mankind's greatest health.
\"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,\" says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
-If PrEP is properly addressed to those who need it and who are at risk, it may have a turning effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, risk group members will receive the NHS-funded trial of the medicine for which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have an enforceable effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was a welcome news.
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that none of the risk groups remain outside it, ” says Ian Green, director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
\"PEP has been acquired in the trial and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people from HIV infection.
“PrEP is a welcome event, which lasted in vain for several months because of government slowdown, ” says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
\"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reverse effect on our work that we are doing to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The trial will help us to understand more about the real benefits of the PrEP medicine.
It is important now that the experiment is launched as soon as possible in the whole country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get another step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped.
Quality of living: the intermediate floor and smart interior solutions have made a small home of Earl's Court
The former banker Joanne Leipzig, who was keen to repair the real estate, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the elegant house of Queen Anna's age. It is about the success of the renovation that Joanne has not packed and changed her chambers.
Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge, Joanne tells me.
I was looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to the house show and found that the rooms were as high as in my apartment.
I was just wondering, and I made the offer on the same day.
Since then, about 90 square apartments have experienced a complete transformation.
Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor so that the height of the room could be used.
I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands, he says.
He hired a job at the Duck & Shed design office in Erfan Azad, Notting Hill. Erfan was able to use the space of rooms nearly four metres tall and to create an apartment that would not only be a place of repair and sale but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for the two overlapping modes, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where it could stand.
The answer was to ask Erfan for creative thinking.
-The steel structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged in such a way that they didn't need a ride.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right both on and below the top of the structures.
Erfan was able to place the space on top of two full - heightd rooms with fascinating details.
In the middle floor, the copper-christ window is opened in an elegant living space.
The mirrored furniture, silver effects, and Serge Mouille's vintage luminaires create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors leads to theatricality, the feeling of the space and the light.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor can make the corridor seem longer.
The mirror in the kitchen spaces is like a window with a view to another room.
In the mirrored furniture of the entrance there is a storage space for Joanne’s meals and glassware.
The more stylish it is that the kitchen can be hidden when it's not used.
Kitchens equipped with a cutting door are not a new solution,
But Joanne's kitchen has the unique fact that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
It took a little planning, Erfan tells me about a steel-toed line-top MDF door.
\"It is balanced, i.e. it slides very easily when it is raised,
With smart use and storage space design Joanne received 16 extra squares, one bedroom and the better bottom solution.
When selling, the area will be determined – or the valuation of the property – says Erfan.
In the case of a back-up, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area.
Joanne’s apartment increased the area by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the farm.
“The person is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the emotional connection to the apartment is partly due to them, ” says Erfan.
No one's going to climb into the electrical lines on the walls.
They're important, too, but not in the same way.
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and accessories can make a basic dwelling exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
The pregnant Princess Sofia beamed in her summer log
The bird in Princess Sofia hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden for the last time before she was born.
The princess at the Sustainable Tomorrow event had chosen a fine light blue dress.
Sofia represented a smiling event.
Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Båstad, Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a wonderful blue body-like outfit that was a wonderfully dressed in the last pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived in the dark blue suite.
This is the last representation that Sofia represents before she was born.
His time calculated is in September.
To the dinner event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
It's a pastel blue. It's a fine princess.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia added to her living in a little bag.
Sofia was very radiating in her raw summer log.
Sofia even took the initiative to talk to the photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia says, laughing and referring to her final love.
He'll raise us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, there appeared home at Lahti Square, where Thai food was sold.
The Lahtians dared not taste it, but walked by.
At home, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Pentilla, known among the Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and Finns did not know that at that time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free taste.
This is how he taught the Gulfmen to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
Try it, he said.
I'm stuck in a hook.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened his Thai restaurant at Lahti Chamber of Commerce.
It had two small tables, I think it was less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and surrounded by places, you cannot leave empty chairs between yourself and the guest.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by the mall, but then the restaurant had to change because they said they'd find too much spice in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the commercial hall.
There's room.
Now we jurors will be able to sit on our tables again, only in the most congealed times we will be surprised to ask guests if there is room next door.
The banker knows his client.
He's been told the rumors where he's been visited and who he's seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the life stages of the customers vary and the food company changes.
He remembers the man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me being thin and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit next to the kitchen door, and share with Panja at the dishes.
Food is not the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili sauce.
He has opened our senses, not only our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many are talking to him about the Thais, thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panya.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always been kind.
He's hard.
He's wearing a restaurant. He's wearing a fungus and a blueberry.
Last week at the restaurant, there was a wedding celebration of two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got we've got weed cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention went this important day, at work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe.
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received an important list for counter-terrorist work.
The list contains more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt, a total of 173 persons are in total and not only their personal data but also photos of each.
Of the persons mentioned in the list, more than 130 are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans involved.
They are from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening Sanomas told me about the list and a few weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it are detailed.
According to the magazine, Special Forces of the Iraqi Army found a list of terrorists' personal data and images when examining a terrorist regime underground base in Mosul.
The US intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in the European countries in May.
The background was fear that something big and serious would be planned in Western countries by terrorists after Isis fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, in addition to the names and images of all persons, there are also their date of birth, invented subjects and information about the person’s country of origin.
There's also a set of terrorist specialties.
For example, in the case of Sami J., a 27-year-old on the list, Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then through Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join the lines of Isis.
There's a suicide bomber written next to his photo.
There's no more detailed information on the man's fate.
Out of Europe, some 6,000 fighters have gone into Isis lines, with no certainty.
The man sank under the surface of the Tokoinranta in Helsinki
Based on the police interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a spider can save a drowning life.
In Tokoinra, Helsinki was saved Thursday by a person under water.
Ville Estlander, the chief fireman of the Helsingin rescue facility, said the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The lifeguard found him under the surface. Estlander tells us.
The rescue department received a report half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered into the hands of first care.
Estlander says it was about a 50-year-old man.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoland is over.
Estlander congratulates on administrative cooperation with the Border Guard and the Police Department.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The locals also provided excellent guidance to divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars were hit in Eura by nine people, three were seriously injured.
There were nine people in the car, and the rest of them got weaker injuries, says the top-friend fireman.
There are both men and women among the injured.
The accident occurred at a crossroads of three roads at four o’clock in the day.
Kolari happened when another car turned the warning triangle behind another car, says the header friend of the fireman.
According to the rescue facility, there is a speed limit of 80 km in the crossing area.
Brothers Fight over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million.
The former president of the Carlton football club and the real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in Torak's value area only three houses from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court to dispute the division of property and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the difference is bitter.
The brothers and their mother Anna owns together 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars. For the family, they started acquiring property when they bought a shop at Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store that expanded into 160 stores.
The chain was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent in real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to a contract with the late family father, Colin owns about two thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's wealth. Paul describes his father as the bearing power and the central character of his family.
According to the legal documents, the asset-sharing ratio means that Colin owns real estate at about $316 million worth and Paul's value of about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
\"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,\" Paul wrote in his first sworn statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was discussed for the first time in the highest court after several conciliation firms.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the business that exists, and Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says it's not true, but he blames Paul on the bad management of some real estate.
Colin writes in one of his first vows that he would like to find a solution.
\"In line with our Italian traditions, my family is most important to me,\" says Colin in his opinion.
The cost of the case is increasing. There are hundreds of pages of enlightened statements, e-mails and reports. The case is being investigated by consultants such as Delitten, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s. At the beginning of the 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as assurance for buying a family from Collingwood into a property that Colin set up the first family jeans store.
Colin tells me that he had founded a trade school in the last few years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years of age)
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, dead in 2012, wanted to transfer property to their sons in agreement.
\"The reader often said that he did not want the brothers to come to trial,\" she says in her statement.
According to Colin, Mark and Luke, the two other sons of the family are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark, they're a total cut-off on the financial terms of their departure.
Colin has kept a low profile, even though it has been a former Australian football league board member and a TV star Eddie McGuire's best friend in 2015 according to this biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
All Colin said was that he said in his text that he was unable to comment because it was dealt with in court.
It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and bring me to a court fight under the name of our family. He wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother’s demands.
\"Our father would not have liked us to argue in this way,\" Colin continued and expressed his hope that there would be a solution.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
Our job is to be settled in court in the near future, Colin wrote.
Trump's new head of staff intends to limit the media use of the President.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly's finally gonna make it.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the new head of staff of the White House intends to limit the media use of President Trump and the follow-up of the news so that the boss would not be so often in trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
“When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with the management staff on his first working day, he took up the key problem he intended to resolve: he intends to limit the information received by President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House employees that all the information, whether printed or consulted, should be carried through her because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information,
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship with television – and as president, he continues to watch a lot of television.
If Mr Trump became nervous about unfair news, he was in favour of the fact that a more balanced media treatment was carried out in a more balanced way, Sam Nunberg, a consultant at Trump’s campaign, told the Politico magazine in February.
According to six former campaign workers, the political journalist Tara Palmer wrote that it is essential that Trump Twitter’s use of Twitter is controlled by a steady flow of sound in his personal media.
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump's Twitter has never been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that others do not know – perhaps Trump's tweets would have been even more entrenched without their efforts.
We probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff have been able to stop him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been vain.
However, no one has been consistently able to stop the noise caused by Trump.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House trying to run their business by providing Trump with information that supports their views. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that counsellors deliberately provide Presidents with questionable information.
The editor, Shane Goldmacher, told me about a case:
“The current and former employees of the trump say that he can be tremendously angry with the tabloids in which he is appreciated – especially if they tell him about the harmful data leaks, and then he has to know where the data comes from.
So it happened at the end of February, when someone vandalizedly gave the president a copy of the website of the GotNews.com, founded by Charles C. Johnson, who accused Katie Walshi of several white house years of data.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrawn them later, and he also did not produce any concrete evidence.
However, after reading the story, Trump had started asking about staff in Walsh,
Goldmacher added that the personnel manager, Reince Priebus, and the staff secretary of the White House, tried to introduce the document management system for Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still a very impulsive himself and his assistants continue to pursue their own business.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year agreement with PSG
A five-year contract with the French football club PSG has been signed by Brazilian performer Neymar, reports AFP.
Previously on Thursday night, representatives of Neymar had paid the FC Barcelona withdrawal price of EUR 222 million to play football in the Spanish league.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona had therefore been dissolved and was free to move to the PSG.
The €222 million transfer amount is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The PSG owns the State-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The former tennis expert, Nasser al-Khelaifi, was chaired by the Society.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
A successful writer, Rajia Orane, explained the hypnosis of alcoholism and fear: \"I am in good health of my life,
About the TV series Rose's time and the pure white sheets are famous for the success writer Raja Orange has just spent her 69th anniversary.
Your hypnosis helped Raja Ora.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren hold grandmas so much that Raja and her husband Jyrki gave up Spanish sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their houses, but now the rental apartment left in the spring.
The light and the sun, away from the old circles Raija took away depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
It's 20 kilos lighter than the outside.
The weight went down when the serotonin medications were stopped, they were mood medications.
I used to be able to help alcoholism with hypnosis, which also caused fear of flight, I won it.
I've been out of alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a sparkling writer says openly.
Raja and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism sector too, has been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raja laughs.
She's always been such a drama queen, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Orane, made by a massive writer, only remembers the good 44 parts Clean white sheets of TV series that touched and moved on the recession time in Finland.
I finally decided to be the industry of the Rikas family company when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary on a plane.
I was the daughter of the ombudsman myself, my mother also had a clothing store, and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Orane recalls.
He said that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and statement revealed it, Oranen says.
Raja Oranen lives as a writer for active time, has many manuscripts under work for hundreds of ideas.
The tourrs returned to the alley of over a million miles.
The wealthiest houseowners in West Midlands are once again on the hook with the self-contained circulars who managed to cross the city’s long-awaited yard and return to the field next to the houses.
The Kiertos parked twenty of their trailer near a street called the Soundhull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they were able to cross the city’s transport trail with the long-awaited white meat they brought with them children, horses and vans army.
The tourers succeeded in crossing the barrier, which had been left unprotected for the sake of the path.
The angry residents have accused Solihull’s municipality of \"full inability to solve the problem\".
The anonymous permanent resident tells us that the circulars had arrived on Monday night from the Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers by a stone.
“We have to work hard because it seems to be completely incapacitated to solve the problem.
The tourers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
They got more tonight, and probably even more today.
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
- I'm on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax if the municipality can't do anything about it.
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned so soon after they were driven out.
- They've been more, and they've even had the horse spread to the park.
According to the municipal informant of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road.
In the interests of collecting evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activities to the police.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation in order to deal with the case.
Raged people surrounded the Portuguese engine
In Portugal, men who were filled with forced landing have been questioned in court today.
As a result of a forced bill, two people died yesterday.
Two men flying the plane can be charged with murder.
At the most, 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal can be achieved.
A small plane flying by men had to make an forced landing on the shores of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon yesterday due to technical failure.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the event, some of which ran the plane to escape water.
The plane hit the 56-year-old man and the 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who had his back on the plane.
Right after that, the plane rose up, and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told the Philipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents weren't hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded the little plane as angry as they were right after the accident.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started hitting it, reported the case in the Celia Rocha Correio da Manha magazine.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people are dead.
The two men on the plane weren't injured in forced landing.
The Finnish star who lost his leg tragically won the World Cup again: \"I would not be the world champion of the accident.
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early on Wednesday morning Finnish time in the World Championship in Big White, Canada.
The Grand Hamari won the World Cup gold in the first race.
Overall, three of the World Cup titles have already been raised.
It's a pretty incredible World Cup!
Two times the gold was dealt with, with a rather good heart drawn, with the telephone-oriented goal of Great Hamari delighted.
A 30-year-old calculator congratulated his coach and well-managed preparation in Finland.
According to Nagy-Hamar, the number of interviewers in the species is growing all the time.
The entire parallel board has grown and developed so much recently.
The differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of new entrants involved.
He always wonders if there's a black horse coming after him.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Greater Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to count with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take the desire to get on the chest.
After all, it comes to mind at times what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's useless.
These cards play what's been distributed, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to set off a serious accident and a loss of the border as a happy defeat, and the Great Hamari would not do it either.
But he turned a terrible difficulty in the interests of him.
Yes, I would say that things turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident was 23 years old, the largest ferrying interest in Great Hamar was already in the process.
The Dun's peak went off with the real thing until after the accident.
I trained when I was a kid with guys, and we always killed X-Games.
But they were far - reaching wounds, which were somewhat dim over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself in the X-Games launch.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to pull the hammer in the neck and start working.
I'd say I've done quite well.
The shooter was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka star as a year of athlete.
The four-time Olympic champion won his prize in the sports game held in January.
According to Great Hamar, star victory is an important signal for the parasports.
It was a big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the sports world.
Since it's time to launch a two-time world champion Matti Nagy-Hamar's annual athlete campaign?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Even Great Hamari has not conquered all the peaks they desire.
Next year, a great goal will be set.
In a year, the Paralympics will be in South Korea.
We're gonna go get the medal!
The majority of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland unless the war is over and Isis leaves the country.
The Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees cooking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland.
They believe that the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump regime sees no change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication agency chain Burson-Marsteller examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
In nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the views and attitudes of Arabs.
This year a Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey was conducted on the views and attitudes of the Syrian refugees of young people living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents might think they're coming back to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the young people’s decision to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) sees the end of the war as the most impressive factor for permanent home return, while one quarter considers that it is important that Isisi leave the country.
Only less than one tenth will make it the most important factor for the decision to improve the economic situation or for the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military measures do not resolve conflict alone
The Syrians were asked what is the most important factor in deciding the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter considers the President of al-Assad to be an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Almost half experiences the need for political and military solutions to put an end to the current Syrian conflict.
To resolve the conflict, only military action will not believe as a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see Isis’s power weakened in the last year, while the fifth is experiencing its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important fight against Isis, and it is generally against terrorism, that the media would convey information to people about the fact that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many were the primary means of military action and training reform.
In the opinion of the 10th honest group, it would be most important to create more skilled jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost every fourth believes that the Syrian conflict will get worse during Trump.
There are two opinions on whether Russia and Iran have improved or aggravated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coded to keep the Internet in order - his database is being developed by Wikipedia and Google, for example.
The Espoo company MariaDB develops the fastest growing database of open source code in the world.
MariaDB’s main product, established by the Coder Michael-Monty-Monty, pays no pays to the users, and can be developed through the Internet by any advanced programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
The databases allow huge data mass to stay in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
All the information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there, explains Widenius.
Widenius, a technology director of MariaDB, spends about half his time coded.
A beautiful hand-to-hand man helps to make sure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open-source database with MySQL in conjunction with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and one year later, Oracle grazed Sun by 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large part of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not make a certain promise to MySQL's future, and he recalls.
He had already set up a company at this stage, which began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired 20 best developers from the Sun, and I made sure that the continuity of the code would be secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A Foundation was set up to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
“In the course of MYSQL these verifications were not made, Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion trade, few Finnishs know anything about MariaDB.
“For the past few years, our growth rate has been about 50% a year, ” says the Financial Director of MariaDB, Kenneth Paqvalén.
The growing MariaDB is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalen is inflamed with the company's rating numbers.
To this extent, he reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that he will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed around it services for which business customers are prepared to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year's career if the customer has used a closed database.
The transition from MySQL to MariaDB will be successful as they are versions of one another.
Among other things, Telefónica, a Spanish operator, and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are the paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer to their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even if we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest gamblers.
Our clients include the world's largest teleopers, gambling companies, banks, and even some central bank, Paqvalén.
The database market is still in place with closed databases of Oraclen, Microsoft, IBM and SAP giants.
Even for Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although Gartner said that the largest database companies have lost their market share over the last few years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still in vain, although fast growing seals.
About USD 50 billion in databases, open source databases do not even exceed a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in cash, since most users do not pay for any of these software.
Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies already develop more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of old databases would have been exchanged into open or at least started.
Large companies do not receive new customers because most of them choose the open source code next.
This has led to the cloud of licence fees in commercial databases.
The companies want to make as much money as they used to be at a smaller amount of customers, the Widenius wonders.
Since the exchange of a closed database is difficult, the majority of the customers have carefully swallowed up price increases.
“There are many customers to whom the transfer is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in the database, ” says Widenius.
He still believes that the size of the customers is coming to an end.
When the license fees rise every year, the customer will move to the open source database sooner or later.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous time, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
In addition, many companies face major changes in their systems by transferring their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth financing ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company now employs around 115 employees worldwide and is currently planning to employ more.
One of the reasons for EIB financing was the influence of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has customers in the public sector, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros per year of databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more effectively, ” says Paqvalén.
I regret the fact that there is money spent in Finland on closed health care systems when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say an open source code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make a code.
The community helps and does things that are not invented or capable of doing.
55-year-old Widenius belongs to another Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, along with the most famous open source.
Widenius helps other companies develop operating business models over an open source code.
I am still holding 4-5 speeches annually around the world on this issue.
Italy is tightening up its attitude towards civil society rescue stations
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that rescue refugees on board in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to operate unless they commit themselves to new rules on their activities.
If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities, the Minister of Interior Marco Minniti said during the interview with the Turinn La Stampa newspaper.
Minniti's warning came on the day after the Italian authorities had seized a German ship of Jugend Rettet's aid organization, which was suspected to cooperate with human smugglers who promoted illegal immigration.
Only one year ago, the aid organization refused to comment on the detailed accusations of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartoso.
We very much regret that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue areas, the organisation announced in its Social Media opinion.
- We can only assess the charges once we have gathered all the information we need, and we can assess the situation.
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet Organisation's Iuventa vessel since October.
The crew are suspected to have taken on board, by boat, refugees directly from persons transporting human beings who were re-usable.
One of these cases was claimed to have occurred only a few kilometers from the coast of Libya, and the information is based on a document from the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have threatened the Italian Coast Guard, which is monitoring rescue operations in the area, and the motive is to be seen as the zeal for aid.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be accompanied by an Italian police that monitors operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue measures have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that they would consider new rules unnecessary but acceptable, because they do not create significant changes or obstacles to the rescue activities of the organisation.
Among those who refuse to follow the Code of Conduct, the Nobel Prize for Doctors Without Frontiers is the organization.
On the other hand, Mr Minniti said that as a result of the rescue measures, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen strongly over the last few weeks, which he considers to be a sign of the fact that actions to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
In the last few days, the minister has begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
He revealed that it was planned to continue this month's discussions with the Libyan mayors on projects for economic development and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees moving towards Europe.
Long-term worker is suspected of having killed his co-conspirator in Enontekio, suspect found on the scene - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in Enontekiö Kiutessa last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish open mate.
In the past, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told me that after what they did, the suspect would have fled the country with two dogs.
The man was found frozen in the ground, and he didn't do the resistance when he was caught.
We have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may be harvested in Lapland’s laureate while still in August.
Robert Hardy, known as my friend Harry Potter and all, is dead.
The British actress Robert Hardy died when he was 91.
On Thursday, this family announced the death of the actor.
Hardy, who was born in 1925, started his acting career at the theatre when he was 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of Magic Minister Cornelius Toffe in Harry Potter's film and his veterinary role in the series of All-Fish My Friends, based on James Herriot's book.
A total of seven sets of popular BBCs were filmed.
Michelle Carter was convicted of a suicide attempt to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls that she thought encouraged her boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, will execute 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years of parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13th.
My family's broken, so Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
My son was my best friend.
Carter applied for a sentence and was given the opportunity to wait for the application to be processed for freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a creamy buffer, listened to the hands of his judgment on the cross with a weeping look on the ground.
His actions killed Conrad Roy, the D.A. said to the court.
He decided to make Conrad's life better than his own.
He hasn't taken any responsibility, the D.A. has continued.
He hasn't shown any regret.
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was due to the shocking circumstances Carter's deep regret.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that neither Carter’s age nor maturity nor even mental health had a significant impact on his actions.
The D.A. read Conrad's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, saying, \"It's not gonna take a day to die of my dear son's death.\"
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm gonna get through all this, and I'm trying to be the best of my ability to comfort his sisters in this pain that we're always going to bear.
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she's a little shy about the idea that she'll never see her brother's wedding and never be a aunt to her children.
It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born.
There seems to be a precedent for the case, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that encouraging suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the car for an intoxication in 2014.
The case raised national attention when it turned out that Carter had been in his text messages encouraging his boyfriend to commit suicide.
I don't know, there are many ways, but Carter wrote many messages that he had sent Roy during the two weeks before he died. Roy was at that time on vacation with his family.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote: \"You have to do it, Conrad, and you just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy.
Judge Moniz said that Carter took note of Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared experts' opinions.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published the Knox Opinion, which states: \"Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison,\"
Secretary General NATO: Between Russia the worst since cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of NATO on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
In my opinion, NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg stated in his interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal integration of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continuing instability caused by Russia's Eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not tighten to the top.
As long as we are strong and as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravating the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had found that there was even a dangerous bad level between the US and Russia.
Trump called on the countries to thank for the poor avoided Congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
The audit will make changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the back blow by car manufacturers.
The day before the Audi announcement BMW offered to update over 350 000 car software.
The BMW Director said that the company believes that there are more rational options than driving restrictions, he referred to European cities, including the BMW hometown, Munich, which consider restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about a payback.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to meet the CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The costs of installation of emissions neutralising devices will rise, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of helping large car companies to overcome problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the make-up of the Volkwagen's mistakes, and the Volkwagen installed in the cars fraud devices that reduced emissions in compliance with the regulations in the tests.
Several of the Volkwagen leaders have been accused in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of the Audi Motor Development Department responsible for thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and can therefore be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation in the field of Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in their cars capable of circumventing European emission standards, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The audit may significantly weaken the position of the VWV manufacturer: the profits of the VWV manufacturer are disproportionate.
The Venezuelan vote began with a sincere examination, with a promise of major demonstrations.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the election result, said Tibisay Lucena, the Chairman of the National Election Board.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
In Venezuela, a representative was elected in the contested vote on Sunday to change the constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of appointment.
According to the El Pais magazine, the national security forces of the country began to take over local time on Wednesday evening.
These forces are intended to ensure the security of the appointment event.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Laventel has become a symbol of the region of South France's Provence, but now it is threatened with climate change.
The lavender had fallen due to the droughts and the insects carrying the diseases. Researchers and farmers are vehemently trying to find a solution to the problem.
The lavender is directly threatened in the province of Provence because it has suffered from the effects of climate change over the past few years, with the result that the rainfalls in the spring and especially in the autumn have decreased clearly,\" says Eric Chaisse, an agricultural expert specialising in the CriEPPAM Research Institute in Provence.
-This shortens the life span of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cots to the area, which spread microbacterials -
The stakes are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a very desirable ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
\"In place of small stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or are missing completely,\" says Chaisse.
In other words, there are less and less parts of essential oil.
The solution will be sought by increasing the efficiency of watering, slowing the humidity of the soil and spraying the soil with a mixture of clay and water that protects the plants, and by developing species that are more resistant to drought.
The supplier's murder is a growing threat in Mexico.
Once a week, the delivery of the Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced suppliers discuss which one is safer: leave the children home or take them with the delivery to which the grenade strike was made in 2009.
Security experts have written three words to the front panel of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names in each group, and no evidence is required, observations and knowledge is sufficient.
They write down the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the list of government or drug cartels, and they're criminals who make out of Mexico's chaos for life-threatening news.
According to the Staff Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto entered office in December 2012, under the protection of the Federal State, there are 589 journalists who are subject to attacks and threats. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states during the current year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
It's a major mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his many books dealing with drug abuse.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The Riodoce building’s public appearance is covered with a huge picture of Valdez’s centre finger. It says: “The law – 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts, decorated with Valdez’s smiling faces. Valdez has glasses and a brand of plastic.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor’s office was established, in particular, for the handling of cases by journalists, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Rapporteurs, only two charges have been brought up so far.
Journalists are rarely entitled to justice, as well as thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime annually are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce's journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are sadder and are even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is only of little use because the killers are not aware and there is no hope of justice.
This meeting is, to be honest, a waste of time, he says.
We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the reason for the event.
Valdez had left Riodoce’s delivery in the capital of Culiacan in the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks in his red senses when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The amount is supposed to be related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away by Valdez's car and hit it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She died of a wife and two grown-ups.
The rumors are moving fast, and the horses are free in Culiacan.
But Valdez's death is a mouse leash.
Sinalo has been the bloodiest fighting fields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and banished to the United States in January.
Some or several people are shot daily in the Sinaloa streets, and the cemetery has two-storey tomb buildings that are larger than many homes.
In the state on the coast, there's a great deal of peace when only one cartel controls ports and routes to drug trafficking in the United States.
While Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and manager of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of being unable to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published the Damaso Lopez interview, leading a competing group that goes to war against the Guzman boys.
The case may have upset the boys of Guzman: customers suspected of being a member of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the paper came to the point of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another magazine published on the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against suppliers.
He had survived so many times that his friends and colleagues were no longer able to fear for him.
He had done a long career in Noroeste when he decided to set up in 2003 with five colleagues in Riodocen. The shares of the paper were then sold for 50 dollars.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem, Bojorquez says.
In time, the magazine began to feel about its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
The journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-class research journalism without fear of censorship, and readers encouraged the journals that no one else dared publish.
For eight years after its creation, Riodoce won the award of the respected Maria Moors Cabot in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez received an international press freedom prize from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists from his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade without being sensitive.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
\"I want to be able to carry on with my life,\" he said when he received the Prize of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
The drug store is in Sinaloa, Valdez said in a TV interview with Rompevinto last October.
\"The editor must accept a falling task – or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?
Riodoce’s staff need Valdezia – a joker who curses like a port worker; they need a friend who always gets mercy and advice. They need a teacher who knows how to survive.
They trusted her routines.
He used a bank hat all the time.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo Bar, and he was always sitting on the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his destiny.
The death of the colleague has also made them wonder how best they can do their job and stay alive.
- Criminals don't like our case dealing with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of business, Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-defence and self-defence,
Trusting in your own instincts.
If it's not the right thing to do, you have to stay away.
The problem is that Mr. Andres Villarreal of Riodoce's journalist is that the impression can be deceived, and that's what happened in Javier's case.
The old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
The mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce’s safety training was held, and a few days earlier it had become apparent that only government spy programs had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied for the shadow of the tree from 40 degrees below.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists were considered to be half their play, whether these two police officers belonged to the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not believe to be reliable.
It had been months since journalists had been running drugs in mountainous rural areas.
At this week's number, Riodoce's delivery was scheduled for three main cases.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinaloa.
The magazine also intended to reveal that the government’s spending on money was concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a quarter away from the D.A.A., was a group of people kidnapped.
It was not official information, who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and public authorities.
The supplier found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered with the names of a powerful institutional revolution (PRI) politician. PRI has been managing Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases of public service corruption.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of El Chapo-Guzman managed to escape and avoid the military raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would receive reliable information about Valdez's column about the kidnapping.
\"In the past, we would have already known what had happened,\" says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received a nickname called El Flaco, a guide, because of his body structure.
Now all our links to our sources of information are across the board.
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse that keeps signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The magazine's employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press-free activists.
The editor, Miriam Ramirez, took a few signs with him the next morning he went to represent the local prosecutor's office, who was once again responsible for the murder of a new reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was murdered in the West state of Michoacani.
After the disappearance, there was a burned body, which, based on the DNA tests performed by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more often throughout the country. In demonstrations, there appear to be “SOS Press” texts on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he tries to obtain international support for the Valdez case.
On the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
Since then, he has asked for his removal from government cases because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and an indifferent society.
In their last remaining book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by the order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 surveillance group, more than half of the attacks on suppliers last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
- In Mexico, people are being silenced by killing, Ramirez says.
Murder has a paralytic effect.
No one forgets the death of Maria Elizabeth Macias, a blogger, in the northern part of Tamaulipas border, six years ago.
His body had a message signed by the Zetas Cartel: \"I'm here because of my writing,
There was a computer keypad and headphone next to his head cut off.
Some of the magazines have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north of Chihuahua border state after the goalful murder of Miroslava Breach.
Some of them continue their activities, like Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though their leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Cidad Juarez published a message to the drug cartels: \"What do you want from us?
Some suppliers have fled their states or the whole country.
It's hard to make a decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and we have to be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals were looking for a journalist, as apparently happened to Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 for three months after he had escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking is a source of fear.
I'm a reporter. Because Mexico's on its way to hell, he's telling me.
Some time ago, Riodoce's journalists sat in front of the delivery station on Friday night for a beer on the sidewalk when the latest issue of the magazine was completed, and their phones began to color as a message.
In the shooting between competing gangs and security forces, 19 people were killed in Mazlant beach crash.
The war was accelerated, as was promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
The suppliers put the news on Riodoc's website with their smartphone on the sidewalk.
We had to re-enter the front page the next day.
Sirens were floating around the area – another shooting scene.
Bojorquez flashed the delivery security policemen:
If they were scared, they hid it very well.
Riodoce’s delivery continued the magazine’s murdered founder tradition under this massive portrait, where the man looks like a middle finger for the whole Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider stopping the operation. How can I stop the magazine when our intern asked me to go to the street and do the same thing the day Javier was murdered?
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback.
Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old in April, became short because the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympics.
However, the exercise period began with a disastrous start when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It started a long period of disease, which took almost five weeks.
In practice, May went completely ill.
At first, there was a flu, and finally a childhood disease like ear inflammation, where I had to eat an antibiotic course.
I was only able to make 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so ill for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't make use of the training experience, so Manninen tells East Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The world champion of 2007 only received a training licence during the second week of June, which appeared at the research centre of the competition and top-level sport in KIHU’s unrolled test on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers on a carpet that is raised at a speed of three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds and the tester takes a milk acid sample with the finger of the athlete.
Last fall on the mat for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Fire against the wall, Manninen tells me.
In the right direction
After all the subspaces, Manninen tells me she's kept healthy.
I have performed numerous peaceful aerobic exercises in which I have sought to normalize your body’s metabolism.
Now it's a really good five-week episode behind.
There was also a half a week's vacation from flight work.
I had time to go to the cabin with my family.
During the last period Manninen participated only in four world cup competitions before Lahti's World Cup.
The best result was seen in the opening contest as soon as Manninen got up at the top by 18th.
The direction is drawn
The main coach of the Manninen and the National Team Petter Kukönen has made a training and competition plan that goes beyond February.
We're going to get a variety of rhythms compared to the last season.
After the first race, Ruka would have a three-world cup competition weekend.
In December, at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau, should be involved.
At the end of January, the plans would still be in Seefeld.
I hope after that, they'll find their name on the Olympic team's list. Manninen says.
The Pyongchang Olympics would already be the sixth Winter Olympics of the career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City 2002 the Nummelian bottom line was celebrated at the gold team competition.
Dinosaur protected against its enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Researchers have now revealed the first results of a creature of the size of the horns found by Canadian miners, which had been so preserved that experts call it the dinosaurs’ Mona Adviser.
It had remained so well that researchers could even determine that its Finnish skin was red-brown and had a problem with the past.
According to Current Biology, it has been the best in all time preserved by a armored dinosaur and representatives of the best species in the world.
The recently found fossil is a nodosaur, which means at the mid-terms of the accession period 110-12 million years ago.
Researchers consider this amazingly well-preserved fossils to be a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, a vegetable eater in his species has been the best preserved fossil in all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine on 21 March 2011 in North Albert Canada, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that seemed not to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to explore his findings more closely.
The fossils found in the Rock were sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrell.
There, for six years, the beast was dug up out of a 100-pound lockshop.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
If you're squeezing your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping,\" says the scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
“It remains in the history of science of dinosaurs Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Naha’s studies found that the meat - eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a major threat to this vegetable eater, even though it had a tank and reminded him of the walking tank.
Its red-white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected from darker and darker coloring, still occurring in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to mix its environment and avoid enemies, bigger dinosaurs.
110 million years old nodosaur rose to the headlines in May, and it is now exhibited in the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrell.
According to Mark Mitchell, a museum designer from Boreelope has been named Mark Mitchell. Mitchell belonged to a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig the dinosaur.
Nodosaurs has remained so amazing that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to define its body’s swamps and panser patterns and shapes.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring, where the body is darker and darker.
However, the observation was a surprise because Boreelope is significantly greater than the current animals with the same coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs eating meat contaminated it to the point that evolution prefers survival to hide instead of battle.
For example, modern animals have a similar coloring in peuros, seropros and armadillos, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaur was also seriously threatened.
\"The great, strongly armored dinosaur catch tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs were,\" Brown says.
The chemical analysis of nodosauric organic compounds reveals that its skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study Nodosaur in order to draw conclusions on its life, including the content of its intestine to find out what it ate on its last meal.
Researchers believe that when it died, it fell into the river and went to the sea where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they are now.
\"This nodosaur is truly significant because its Finnish skin has been preserved and has also remained three-dimensional in its original form,\" Brown says.
This is why it looks almost the same as in the early accession period.
Its definition does not require much imagination: if you squeal a little bit of eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep.
The period of joining was the age of the Teropods, the huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Even though their king Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years before Boreelope, his mighty predecessors may have taken this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus Rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaur researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe Boreelope was washed out after his death and emigrated to the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine on 21 March 2011 in North Albert Canada, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it has remained the world’s best armored dinosaur with leather and armor from the shell to the hips.
The Nodosaurs were 5 metres long on average and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
They had two half-metre peaks on their stage.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetable eater went through the current West Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has kept small details in the sea sepulchre.
Its fossilized remains so well that its skin remains on the brink of the armor, along its skull.
So Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that this kind of preservation is just as rare as a lottery win.
The more it looks, the more amazing it feels.
There are still fossilized skins on the discs of that skull pan.
Its right-hand side is on its side, five toes up.
I can also lower its foot cover.
How did one activist learn to answer the question: who has the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier from his home in New York, from St. Louis, and he was sitting in his airbnb apartment on his bed, browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed the message from his high schoolmate:
The police just killed an 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street.
As a result, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline contained numerous retwitchings from the user @TheePharoah.
The user's name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis, who waswitching in real time for the death of Michael Brown, who had been shot by a white police officer in an unarmed 18-year-old Brown Ferguson, Missouri State.
This user had also posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
This is incredible. Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put away his phone, and when he came back to Twitter later that night, people were told to collect on Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of the police shut-downs and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father, who read on the sign: \"Fergusson's police just killed my gunless son...
Ferrell was following a real-time video photo where the police stood in front of the protestors with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video where the other police pulled a rifle and shouted, \"I'm gonna kill all of you... animals...
This isn't normal, Ferrell remembers what he said.
It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
From what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in almost three years' time, a documentary film entitled Hose Streets has been produced. It received its first night at the cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression of mind, love and loss, and strength and strength from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter who was dressed in a matching crown, they renegotiated the discussion about what it is like to live in black and where they had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
Do you remember when I told you how black people have been forced to fight for the things that they believe, Ferrell remembers his words to his daughter?
We're on our way to Ferguson 'cause the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right.
I couldn't help but be with my daughter, Ferrell told me later.
The events of this day are... the peak of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow into it.
He must be able to act and organize, but he also needs to be known as a black person for the various layers and conditions of living experience, and he needs to know what we need to do to get rid of ourselves.
Fortunately, although I've been able to protect him from violent racism, he's still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I would harm him if I protected him from reality.
Their first stopover in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station. It became the campplace of activists when they expected the case to be handled and eventually found out that there would be no prosecution against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protestors.
Ferrell gradually began to take action in a new way.
“Aktivismini changed completely after August 9th, ” he says. During his studies at the University of Missour, St. Louis Ferrell was chairman of the organization of medical students belonging to minorities. At that time he focused on the right to food and health problems in black communities.
I didn't have any experience in organising.
Somehow, it just happened.
Weeks later Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were simply trying to tell us what was happening.
He said, \"Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use?\"
The doubt was caused by countless times when people appeared in the local community, usually white people who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and tightness.
\"We heard that the people who were born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice,\" said Folayan recently at the interview. \"We wanted to do things differently.
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activity with the prisoners who were sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project in conjunction with six other locals. The description group followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
This isn't a document that someone's talking to us or talking for us, but we're talking,\" Davis says.
The most important thing for me was how local people are being presented in a movie because I'm being presented in the same way.
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell, because it was wanted to show that it was not about the charismatic leader, but about the community. Ferrell proved to be more open to the picture.
That is why the document shows surprising private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
I felt rather naked, Ferrell laughs when he told me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
\"But I understood that this work and the human representation of black people require a certain degree of vulnerability.
In addition, Ferrell's story again and again in the wider Black Lives Matter movement of the middle-night black quer women.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot a black teenage boy in Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identical to the queer identity.
“The leadership of the black quer women has kept the entire movement, ” says Ferrell. “It’s because we have to fight on many fronts.
The black quer women have had to endure everything.
Folayan concurs: \"You really have black women with a lot of queer women.
He points out, however, that Ferrelli was not selected for the document in its own terms because of his quer identity.
He's got the power, Folayan says.
It's not a coincidence, however, that she was in the front line.
His energy is coming from a white cloth.
The news groups have long since left Ferguson, but the Community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole, and he was convicted of blocking the highway in demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate in his home corners is brief and central: \"The Consequence:
Yet he still trusts in the catch clause he learned outside the Ferguson streets three years ago:
It's our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
All we can do is lose our chains.
Suitable consistency: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of an exhibition space with faces – white, black and brown faces, between which you can see the same view.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of the prison in Fort Leavenworth, where he executed his 35-year sentence. Manning was condemned to leak classified diplomatic telegrams to the WikiLeaks site.
Rowey-Hagborgin The Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
Its background is two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a trans-trans- and urban dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced his term of office on the third day.
Its genetic data was used to analyse Manning's DNA from the algorithm, and it created 30 images. They are sharp, though slightly theoretical positioning of the causation of DNA data, multiplicity, and underlying causative relationships and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born in Bradley Edward, has openly reported his identity to women since the break-up. In 2013, he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including violations of the law on spying, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of the manning who was convicted of the prison: a rake, a black-and-white selfie, in which the troubled-bodied Manning sits in the car where the driver is standing.
Mr. Bowey-Hagborg had a very popular Stranger Visions project behind him in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
There he created portraits based on criminal knowledge, and he obtained DNA data from, for example, tobacco scenes and chewing gums, and he created images of what could have been looked like by the people in question.
Then the artist received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their conversation.
He couldn't visit Manning and could not be photographed in prison. Thus, the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if he'd be interested in making Manning's DNA image.
The artist and his captured wall came suddenly with correspondence buddies, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a Suppressed Images series film, pictured by Shoili Kanungo. It described the future where the President would have reduced Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama reduced Manning’s sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book. It was a lucky coincidence after the seven years of rank in the national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened just now, when Donald Trump goes to his own war against intelligence leaks and transversal soldiers, and he will come up with new ways to strengthen those powerful dubs that he actually had to mitigate.
Mr Hagborg believes that everything has its purpose.
On the wall of the gallery is the artist's statement and under the great signature of Manning, where the heart of the last name (i) is the point. In his statement, the artist requires an end to the automatic division, on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based,
The opposite wall has the Manning's DNA sequence, a long line of C, G and A letters written on the lead pen.
In this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, such as the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biologicals.
“I hope that my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that the genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations, ” says Dewey-Hagborg. Her Surious Memories video production is also presented in 2007.
- DNA tells countless stories, and there's 30 of them.
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: the page of the comic book of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
There, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
- If they get you slowed down, they've won, it says in the picture.
- Don't be hard on me.
The paper is from a letter I received from Manning, an artist from Philadelphia.
It's so impressive that I'm still getting cold colors.
Unlike the comic book described, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes in, he was greeted with his own genetic data-based faces as a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is meaningful, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning's DNA sequence is written on a lead pen to a height that is the same as its length (15,5 cm).
\"The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them, \"Dewey-Hagborg says.
I wanted to describe the mass movement Chelsea gave birth to, which was also behind his release.
Professor of Northwestern University and employee of Oxford University are wanted as suspects in murder
Police report that they have launched national searches to find a professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University suspected of stabbing him to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to the documents of Cook County Law, the arrest warrants were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and from Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. Arrest warrants were issued for the murder of first degree without the possibility of being released from bail.

\"Police has an idea of where they are, and we keep checking our search for them,\" Guglieliel said.
According to the Gugligills, local, regional and national authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
He told the police that he had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, which had given him an vague indication that something had happened in the apartment of 1008.
The police described the scene at the scene as terrible.
According to the Guglimas, it is unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
\"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair,\" says Guglimel.
The Grand Plaza Steering Team published the following statement to the residents: \"We should now examine the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence,
He threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London.
I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic, the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt should be performed 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man got convicted of his threats to blowing up a Islamic bookstore in London and killing all Muslims.
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, serious harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore's staff alerted them to the scene on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man was so eager to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt got caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not linked to the events of the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same costume as the suspect in the bookstore's events, the police informant said.
I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogations.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay €620 legal expenses of about €690 and €85, i.e. approximately €95 compensation to victims.
According to Scotland Yard's informant, a number of hate crimes are not reported.
\"We take the steps in line with the WADA road map in the near future – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Mutko has said that Russia will soon conclude measures in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Office's WADA Road Map which can restore the RUS mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
“Part of the road map measures have already been implemented and RUSADA was entitled to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD of the UK Anti-doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA's road map, which sets out the conditions for re-establishing the RUSADA mandate, and the second part of the road map was recently published on the website of the organisation.
According to the doctor, there is nothing that concerns Russia.
- Everything has been announced, and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future – but will not be added.
However, one of the road map points requires that Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of the study by WADA, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren examines the alleged state's share of the Russian sports doping.
Muko said: “The study is going on because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no national programmes, and we cannot admit things that did not exist.
In Mutkko's words, there was a echo of the statement by Vitally Smirnov, President of the Russian independent public anti-doping committee.
Earlier on the same day, Smirnov admitted to the Russian RSport Sports Media that there were problems in the Russian anti-doping institutions.
We are not going to accept this report without any condition, but he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping supervision in Russia in November 2015, when the extent of doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The director of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited the headquarters of RUSADA in Moscow in July. After his visit, he stated that the organization was on a \"right road\" towards the return of powers.
The British organization, in sceptical form of innovation for Finns: health benefits of maternity packages – there is no evidence –
The British organization has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, BBC and Guardians say that the Lullaby Trust, which fights homicidal deaths, prohibits the use of their own brochures in maternity packages in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of death.
A chain death means an unexplainable sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust works as an expert in British health authorities in the safe sleep of the child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed with them because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland is one of the world's lowest child mortality readings, only two dead thousand born.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is a result of a number of reasons, such as a small amount of teen waste.
The fact that they're giving each family a box may be one factor.
You can't be certain, however, that Lullaby Trust's CEO, Francine Bates, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hidden deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The pack contains a variety of articles, such as baby clothing.
This year, there are 53 products available in the pack.
The package itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, all safety standards are in line with its shared boxes.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no standard of security for cardboard bags as a place of sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best alternative for sleeping if there is no frame or floor bed available.
The organization recommends that you use the package only for the day-to-day sleep and stop using it at the time the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the package and ensuring that they do not soak or fall.
She ran away from the Japanese zoo for a second time.
The Japanese zoo crew is looking for a shaved turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at speed and already escaped for another two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa’s zoo in Okaya, West Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried about the Yoshimi Yamane working in the zoo.
The 35-year-old frog is a female, 55-pound-long and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
In the open hours, the frog can travel freely in the tarage area.
The zoo has not received any sightings of the turtle.
The last time I checked out, I had a runaway last week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues to help me, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company to avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Krett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in their online trading start-up, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious.
“The tests were simply not consistent or objective, ” says Krett. Madison Reed, as a hair care company, focuses on online commerce. 75 employees.
You decided to rely on outside help.
The market has become more and more new types of start-ups for staff management, which will help other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee commitment, and companies can ask questions and target them to certain teams and groups of people and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and in some cases direct contact with the management of the management.
\"My own health can be monitored by applications such as Stravan and Fitzbit, but where you stay in Fitbit, you ask the founder and CEO of the Glint label in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint provides companies with analytical software to measure employee commitment.
You've been using Glint's software for three years, and he tells you that he's got a deeper view of his employees' thoughts and feelings.
The program can make rapid surveys and votes for certain teams, and it can also draw up a map of which you can see with one view of which departments are the most dissatisfied and who the leaders have received the weakest estimates.
Enterprises have understood that they need to monitor the working culture so that they do not become the next Uberia. The transport company has been in pain since the former employee wrote about the culture in his blog, where workers are in distress and the penalties that speak about their problems.
For startups such as Glint, such failure is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and conformity are a global industry, the value of which, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, can rise to over $181.7 billion by 2020.
Convertcent in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent inappropriate use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year, when Uber’s reputation experienced a crash.
Convertcent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently signed a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convertcent allows companies to make customised surveys, collect answers in a confidential way in real time and identify problem areas.
In addition, workers can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if there is reason to doubt the manager of the case, the complaints will go directly to the company's government.
“The general opinion has been rejected by the authorities, ” says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convertcent.
He recalls that if the company treats its employees badly or does not work in an ethical way, the consequences can be expensive, even if the authorities do not interfere with it. Consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose workers and be challenged by the court.
The Ruby Tuesday food chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites. The company has used Convertcent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily contact the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he first had to find out the telephone number or email address, which enabled him to report to the headquarters. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a scary and unpleasant experience, ” says Ruby Tuesday, Legal Director James Vitrano, who said it was difficult to follow the complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
\"I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee,\" says Vitrano, who is leading Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
The same way we protect our shareholders from court proceedings related to employment relations.
According to Quinlan, companies started to take a more serious attitude towards ethics, values and employee commitment after Arthur Andersen collapsed in the context of the Enron scandal.
Only through social media did the companies realise that they could no longer prevent the public investigation of their boxers.
\"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came into ethics control,\" said Quinlan.
Glint and Convertcent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model approved by capital investors, and it is also possible for Glint and Convertent to support capital investors.
In February, Convertcent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sawphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Pii Valley, good wages are just the beginning of interesting projects.
Workers want to know that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a genuinely beneficial enterprise.
“Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being heard and that their work is rewarding, ” says Nina McQueen, CEO of the LinkedIn company responsible for the remuneration and well-being of workers.
The investors get a profit when the companies succeed, and the companies succeed when the employees commit.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen employee commitment, so it is no wonder that they interest investors.
According to experts in employment culture, information on the commitment of workers is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken on that basis.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be regarded as a sign of change.
And if change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee commitment.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to conduct four thousand discussions, ” says Russell Raath, Director General of the Management Consulting Company Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on mere information gathering.
If the company does not take action, the workers will start to wonder if they are heard.
And their opinions don't matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?
According to the author, Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly staff surveys and is able to cope with the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from those who were frustrated with decision-making and quality communications, Mr Krettt was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to resolve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands her employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve staff permanence in the long term in an industry known as the high turnover of workers.
If the company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees,\" Vitrano says.
If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies...
In Sweden, 20-year-old men are suspected of disguised their naked female neighbours, reports the News Office TT.
The woman in Göteborg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed her window outside of her cell phone hanging out a bitch's head.
She said the cell phone camera took a picture of the apartment.
A woman scared of the case had run to another room to get dressed.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but it was quickly counted back into the window.
A 20-year-old suspect has admitted to filming a woman.
However, he claimed that he only had a picture of a woman's face.
The video on the phone had been removed, and the police had failed to restore it as evidence.
During the interrogations, the man has admitted a crime, but he refused to commit a crime.
A man in his shooting was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor as a madman.
According to the U.S.T., the prosecution against a man is charged.
Teachers demand more liquid in the autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than that of the export industry, for example, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Luke on Thursday.
The temporary surgery of public holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the examination would not have in any way involved holiday cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts are only due to the signature of private sector papers and the percentage of increase clear.
Luke predicts that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets Luke did not yet reveal.
Luke is also the President of Juko, a public-trained negotiating organisation.
Luke: Lomararah surgery increases earnings differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a deterioration in the purchasing power of public sector employees while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luke, a fixed-term vacation surgery will further reduce earnings differentials.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured because the differences between the best and the most vulnerable are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning results are declining, and differences between pupils and regions continue to grow.
Bruins’ Day was extended when the NCAA reduced daily exercises for two to one
It's almost 11 o'clock in the evening, and a bunch of UCLA American football players have been left to talk to another side of the campus's new training fields.
Some have removed their shirts, and their backs are glazed from the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of talking is a midday break.
After three hours of training in the university summer courses, the students will return to the apartment to read the finals. The next morning, they will be meeting at a football center in Wasserman.
The next three days are going to be hard on these guys, but Coach Jim Mora, Bruins, says a little before Monday, on Tuesday.
The university culture roofing organization reduced daily exercise rates by two to reduce the number of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests are held.
That's why the first three exercises of UCLA began in 15 minutes more than seven nights. It was hard to find space from the already full schedule of players.
Limiting the number of exercises in one day means that there are more training days. This year, the camp began almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in Mora's six years of continuing Westwood training when exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are to be held 18 times before the 20th day of August, when the actual preparation of the season opening match: UCLA will be scheduled for September at the Texas University of A&M.
Mora says that she supported the NCAA's change of rules, even though it made players' schedules even more stringent.
“We’ve been very hard on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging, ” says Mora.
But the players are ready to work, and they're great friends.
I think things will get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes exercises from outside the camp. It is not easy to take into account a direct view from the training fields to the next parking area and to the Luski Center, a flat-screen hotel that has already been bombed over the rear of the paint pole with flying football.
Bruins players are supposed to move to a hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the period when rooms are available outside.
- We have security, Mora says.
“It’s a matter of concern that people can book a room and describe exercises on the video. It’s not an excessive concern.
The video described in the exercises is paid quite a bit.
But we have guards in the parking lot and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna bother myself too much about it.
We have a plan.
Release to Rwanda
In Rwanda, Central Africa, the presidential elections are held on Friday, which are already seen as the winner.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking for his third period, but in practice he has had an impact on the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF stopped the violent genocide organized by extremes.
Kagame was the commander of RPF.
Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, the crackdown of the opposition and the limitation of freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to make an effort, because the Constitution that was limited to the two years of presidency has been amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
In his day, social reforms have been made in Rwanda and international investment has taken place in the country.
Furthermore, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country of genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African states.
However, even the Kagame has promised his people more freedom after the land has been brought on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights for fake news by intensifying the fact-finding process
Facebook plans to send possible falsifications more and more frequently to independent fact-finders and to present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced it on Thursday.
On its website, the company published an opinion that it will start using updated machine learning to identify novels. Possible falsifications will be sent to facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being the biggest spreaders of disguised news, and many believe that false news had an impact on the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has arisen into a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with false news before the May presidential election and the September elections, Germany supports the plan to take over social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in its separate opinion published in Germany that the fact-finding is being tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
People want to see what stories do not pass the independent inspectors' cell. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightenedly what they read and share – the product manager Sara Su wrote on Facebook news feed in the company blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the subject-related articles function and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce falsifications.
The birth of a comic book: Story of a castle
The small Scotney Castle in the Count of Kent is now known for Squeez's music video and for Margaret Thatcher's hideout since the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has over 700 years of stormy history, and now this charming place in Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old mop-haired writer.
I'm glad to be able to study the text written by more than 300 years ago by a dead person, Rhodes says with all due respect.
I know a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand.
The book Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of the families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to Edvarian times. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoon artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes' archives. In 2014 it appeared from him Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, which inspired the sources of inspiration were the documentation of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
In a letter I saw tears, I had a thumbprint, and the letter had written a double agent working on the Jakobit in the 17th century, and Rhodes says.
- It was his print!
And the letters smell like clay because at that time fire was used as light.
Three centuries later, the smell of the reader makes the reader feel that he is on the spot himself.
I love archives.
The writer who spent almost four months in prison with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the British National Art Council, who seemed too good to be true, admitted that he could not be in the castle without delay for a little longer than he was supposed to be.
He spent days researching Victorian novels, castles, archives, treasures, and rares, such as hyena pins hung on walls, and hundreds of bottled bottles.
He tourd the old castle with ruins and premises and discussed with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes with imaginary artists.
Last night, she was doing whiskey and she started writing,
The closer history of Scotney is rather unknown, for the city was transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was only about to enter the archives through. Rhodes describes that archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
There were journals in the archives, letters from time to time in the English Empire and maps of who owned anything. \"You could imagine that the country disputes are boring, Rhodes says.
I was wondering if we'd give it a chance.
Some of the stories in the book are moving from castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It tells about a man who will soon join the castle after the completion of the English peasant rebellion in 1381.
“The Knighty Familys of Kent and Sussex says that there was a riot in the castle in 1380s, Rhodes says.
\"The English peasant rebellion began in the same region, and it came to my mind that the rebellion could begin from the riot.
Maybe these events are connected to each other.
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of the priest, which Darrell’s family hid for seven years during the era of religious cleansing in England.
The Smuggler again tells of the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell in the 1700s. He said he staged his own funeral by filling his coffin with stone (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. The men of the family seem to have been quite some freaks, and they kept into debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men in Darrell's family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to ease the heiress.
Now Rhodes is applying for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on Lifetime Hill, a health plant in the beginning of the 20th century, which left only a fiery property.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
It was sad to leave there, she'll tell you.
I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this evil day.
You'll break the worst in Russia then cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of NATO on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
In my opinion, NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg stated in his interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal integration of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continuing instability caused by Russia's Eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not tighten to the top.
As long as we are strong and as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravating the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had found that there was even a dangerous bad level between the US and Russia.
Trump called on the countries to thank for the poor avoided Congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko will stop - the rerun against Anthony Joshua will not be realized
Long-term heavy-duty series champion Vladimir Klitshko ends his career.
Klitshko, Ukraine, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who hit gold at the Atlantic Olympics in 1996, was a professional 69 times winning against 64.
He held different MM titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klishko lost his career in two last fights.
Tyson Fury found him at a point in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium and disappeared after a rough fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshkko were expected to meet at the renewal match in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klishko did not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately took a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko told me when he informed me.
And now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never imagine having such a long, incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
See Klitshkko's explanatory notes on video.
Klitshkon Manager Bernd Bönte reported that the closure decision was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettier since 2009.
There is one child on the spot, Kaya, born in 2014.
Vitali, the great brother of Klitshkko, is also the former world champion of the heavyweight series.
In 2008-12, brothers and sisters ruled the World Trade Organisations' World Trade Organizations at the same time.
The Finnish weather provider will rise to the conditions: - Five of the files -
Seahead Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer’s outdoor railway season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken her from a fidelity.
Even in London's World Cup, there are unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkonen is talking about weather.
The conditions have been this summer against Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but I can't believe I didn't even get the little hens to move properly, Nakkänen said after the Insbruck race.
I've competed and practiced here in the road how many times I've never experienced in this place as a variable wind, Nikkanen told me about Paavo Nurmi Games.
During this period the standardization of jump has been very difficult, since the exercises have had such unstable winds, Nikkän said in Kaleva's competitions.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
It's been a bit of a challenge to get the technology together... whether it's cold worship or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away from the file.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy in a bad condition.
He got into the World Championship with 455 thanks to his own gray jump.
It's gone outside 445.
The relationship is not the same for everyone in London.
We have to be gentle and wait for better wind.
The aim is to exceed 460 on Friday.
Why don't you just practice abroad?
That's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump in the pile and I got the tech standardized.
I guess I should've done the same thing now.
Normally, the government has been trained, now the hall has been closed.
What would be an ideal race?
25 degrees warm.
A little wind, as long as it's standard.
\"We have no choice now or for many years,
Despite the positive climate in the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must keep the ice on the hat and avoid the expansion of the state budget with debt money, warn Erkki Virtanen at the Ministry of Finance to warn the budgets of decades of preparation.
He said there's no room for sharing.
In 2015, Yle interviewed retired from Virta in the middle of the week in the Ykkösamu.
The state's budget for next year is just about to begin.
In recent times, politicians' proposals have been raised, including the increase in the guarantee pension, the reduction in car tax and the support for electric bikes Virtanen sees as an election speech.
They mainly say that elections start to be close because when 10% of the government budget is financed with additional debt, we have no allocation now or for many years.
I even feel like it's a fraud to talk about sharing money when you owe it, Virtanen told Yle.
Mr. Virtanen stressed that all the debts were owed to the children.
Mr Virtas has a long experience in preparing the state's budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as a budgetary secretary and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget and Head of Budget.
Last time he retired, he was the head of the Office of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Mr Virtanen pointed out in Yle's interview that the forecast for growth of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a barge from which to go into the underage next year, and Finland expects a 1% increase in tens of years.
Washington amends the rules on permanent residence permits
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that a permanent residence permit, i.e. the rules of Green Card, would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
According to the media, applicants benefiting from the new search process who know English and can support themselves and have the skills that benefit our economy.
The Queen's spouse does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaree.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margaree described in April.
The Queen of Denmark, Margareeta, 77, and Prince Henry of her spouse, 83, will not be buried next door, reports the Danish Court.
Traditionally, the dynasty couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The Kingdom Hall has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde's Church, the court states that he will be informed on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction in his role in the king's family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied in his roles and titles in the Danish Monarch, the Court's Head of Communications, Lena Belleby commented in the paper.
The prince's decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence that he is not treated as equal to his mate.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of the wish of her mate for a tomb and understand the decision.
A dread on the road: the car was on the freeway
Tomm had an open partner and two little children on his way.
They were not injured in the accident, but they will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not targeted.
The accident occurred with Keimolanport in Vantaa.
A archive image of the construction site of Kehä III.
Vantaan Tommi tells his family that he survived Tuesday with a miracle in a car accident.
Tommi, the two small children of the couple, Riina and Riina, were driving on the freeway for Keimolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From ring III to Hämeenlinnalä, a white car that was to drive on the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without traffic, the car would have come on with Tom.
I was driving and I turned the car at the same time, and it went out of hand, Tommi tells me.
The family's car ran into the rails at high speed.
The parents and the two children on the back seat were not injured.
One child is a little less than 3 years old, the other person under the age of one year.
It must have been a pretty good luck when we didn't have anything to do with it.
No one was even driving past us, even though there was a lively traffic.
The accident happened at 5:20 p.m.
Tom says no one stopped at their house, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car with their own powers.
The staff of the ambulance and rescue department came in, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went to redemption.
Tommi tells him and the co-operator of small incomes, and they got a family allowance for buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without any other car information, the family won't be able to get money on the insurance.
That's why the family wants witnesses to notice a car that led the family to a blind spot.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to the tar and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw the car was a white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the car's license number was the beginning of the SIG.
If we don't get caught, I don't know how we're going to be financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that things have happened or that something might be connected to the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had a post on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
The title and the case were corrected at 21.15: Unlike the case originally told, the other car, according to Tom, did not come across the receiving lane, but had to drive from the accelerator to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jappisen's performance deals with human relationships by means of humor - self-dismantling will be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings his premiere guide to the What? Theatre.
The composer is a musical theatre show that was wrong about past human relationships and insufficientness.
According to Director Lotta Jappis, it still feels good.
The subject is dealt with by means of humor.
You don't get to hang around with bad feelings, he says.
According to Jappinen, the rolling summer theatre has been implemented with a long-term budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation is challenging to reflect on what a person reveals himself when he learns about a new person.
Do you think he's gonna pull a role, or do you think he's gonna get a second coat open?
A plotless presentation confuses the fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both guided and dramatized the performance.
He also responds to the lights.
The presentation is made up of the texts of the working group and has no idea.
The director believes that even though the presentation draws young people away from their thoughts, it talks to all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that self-disputing does not directly describe the human relationships of his own and the working group.
Fact and fiction get mixed up.
I'm sure my world of values will be interested in the show.
I do not think that human relations would be bad, but I do not think that human relations, especially relationships, would be a good condition.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that self-reviewer draws a timely picture of young adults living in Finland who are 100 years old.
According to him, many have learned a great deal from their human relationships parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you need to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes a member of the dressing room, Ella Snellman.
Music reconciliation is Jappisen and Roka.
The love of the theatre started in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, is studying as director of the theatre expression at Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's two years behind you, and there's another muck in the back.
Member's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The music category is an assistant to Kouvola Theatre and has been played at the University Theatre in Helsinki, and lastly at Linna Theatre in Turku.
The guidance has started to interest more and more.
The self-dismantling guy got his first night at Narr's play last week in Helsinki.
In the future, at least in the city of Jappi, Turku, the performance of about 45 minutes has also been seen.
At Kouvola's What? Theatre, 8 p.m., 19 p.m., 5 p.m., 14 p.m. and 19 p.m.
The Finnish Olympic champion recovered for a year from a terrible motor accident - the neckline broke.
Few athletes in Finland have the same unsuspectable natural power as Janne Lahtla.
In Kumpareography, hundreds of days a year went around the world for twenty years and pursued their dream of the Olympic gold.
The dream came about in 2002, but the Lahtola movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimentor of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth, which the Kemijärvi would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired to train.
There's always something new, Lahtila tells us.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtla altogether.
In 2014 Lahtila became a motorcross-innet.
As a result, his necklace and both his hands broke.
I wasn't working at all.
I used to lick wounds at my home for a year, Lahta says.
There was bad luck at the bay.
He also admits that age may have had some part of it.
You know, driving on a bike might sound a little rough.
But I didn't get the limits.
It's just so hard as a species that a 40-year-old can't be too busy!
After the accident, Lahtola became into a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
The Japanese Freestyle country team had a long lead coach behind it.
Lahtila started in the nest immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtla tells me.
During their training period, Lahtila often challenged his shield in front and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my thoughts did not seem reasonable either.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in position.
I actually enjoyed it because I could actually be just for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtla to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd burn to the end.
It's easier for Cropa to find places that've gone all the way across than fines!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed to rest so much.
Lahtila started as a coach of the Finnish Freestyle Country Team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby for the speeders.
I switched the motocross to a frisegolph!
That's right out of the shovel.
At his worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtila has always been a super-intendent, she does not require her trainers to be the same as her.
I'm not gonna force all of them into the same fashion.
In our species culture, there is a chance to be like one another and to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtila says.
The sex robots are coming, and we need to be worried.
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot sector – just as it was beginning to feel that 2017 could no longer become more strange.
Yes, I do.
The sex robots are a big deal now.
The Responsible robotics Foundation (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
\"We must take a serious approach to the generalisation of sex robots,\" says Noel Sharkey Sheffield, founder of the Foundation and professor of robotics and artificial intelligence.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes of the robot, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingers.
\"The sex robots are hovered, but they're already sold quite a bit, and we're going to see them more and more,\" Sharkey said the report at the release.
Sexes have developed from blowing dolls to robots with warm-looking silicone skin and artificial intelligence features that resemble the use of man.
The user can also adapt the robot to his or her own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and to the type and color of the fingers.
Even more worrying is the fact that robots have a \"personality\" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sexes have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character features of RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, for example, shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is an adventure and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts to the user’s personality as fully as possible, the company’s website is advertised.
In other words, robots like the same things as the user.
It also has different opinions:
It may be tired, in a chat mood or in a mood.
There are many worrying features of sexbots, which replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is women's submission and direct rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a new and counterproductive programmed robot.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot with the vibrator:
She's got a vibrator, so why shouldn't men have sex robots?
However, sex robots are not just a fetis or a new kind of sex toys.
Their generalisation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual relations, where subjugation is one alternative among others.
Of course, most men do not get sex robots, and their popularity continues to be marginal, although the FRR report has shown their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a great deal about the spirit of time.
And many start acting strangely or offensively only when the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have become more common at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and in the White House, the President who has been bragging about the women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjatérsi) is not the most worrying image language of its powerful image, for example, images of hanged bodies and the eyes dug out.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprising short journey.
The sex robots are being tried to make as many real women as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and movement to imitate human movements as well as possible.
Their personality, however, is far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history – no fantasy of independence or complete submission.
They're pleasant servants.
Slavery.
Police suspect: Two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, leading the group to Isis's chief
The head of the business organisation Isis led a group of Australian men, who are suspected to be carrying the bomb into the plane of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the leading character was also sending the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The reservations indicate that the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us more about why the company stopped.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas-discharge device and to take the device to a full public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
Trump's good side?
Get Mitt Romney to look like an heirloom of mind.
During the Trump period, it has already been repeated until we get bored that there has also been a sharp division of misgivings of voters at the everyday level of families.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper advisory sessions guided how to deal with the Trumpic relatives.
All of us want to have a break-in information pattern.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to combine families.
I'll tell you about this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, and he's a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago, who has long been blindly opposed to the Republicans of our family.
He reminded me that a common enemy could have a powerful connecting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins are all familiar – also a Republican-sponsored sister with whom he has been arguing for decades – suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table it is a good thing, but more widely thought about it involves significant risks.
Trump has given new power to the left, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we are talking about the scary possibility that one day we will no longer be able to hide his tricks.
In the long term, the possibility of Trump normalising the right extreme Republicans, which all of a sudden seem reasonable when compared to Trump.
I recall Mitt Romney's controlled version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and we have seen his tax return at least).
When the Trump season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate needs to be clear, and it seems to be immediately a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin came to visit me, we took our child to a carousel in Central Park, which is the biggest carousel in New York Park, and the best thing in New York is three dollars without caffeine.
Karusell's horses are huge, in the center of the characters – the horrid clowns and the animals that look behind their backs of terror – and the underlying screaming music is strangely fascinating.
Many of the New York features become disappointing over time: the views of the high buildings begin to get tired, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city is not the same as dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I haven't come all over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cabin, but a big transport circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, though, is a Swiss-speaking pub, but it is not counted.
Instead, there is still a strange magical experience in Central Park – even to the extent that two two - year - old, eleven - year - old and two forty - year - old women enjoy it enormously.
I would've given the carousel a complete score if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week I was asked at the department store to estimate my payment experience on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on a reader.
It's the same thing in the cafe at my home corner, but there's also an option for me to combine an estimate of 15% of the service fee when I go to the coffee desk myself.
This slows down the everyday interaction and pressures the customer server to put their personality in a game where it is not needed.
The seller smiled at me when I was tired of giving five stars to my credit card usage experience.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Interi.
FC Inter has today released the Shefki Kuq Society's Mission Team Coach.
The training responsibility will be taken by Fabrizio Piccare, former assistant coach.
The rest of the training team will continue in its current positions.
Picquareta, Italy, has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
In January, Piccareta, a 51-year-old joined the Inter Training Group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FC Inter, sorry for what happened.
Changing the coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the company management, when there was no other option now, Håkans commented on the association's information.
The Picquareta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He's already responsible for the home game tomorrow with the rest of the coaching team against HIFK.
According to the night-to-day data, the team has been on Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the company’s assistant coach Picquareta and John Allen have been moved away.
Kuqi and Piccare were strongly joined in an Interi match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a young picture of the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, the violinist, published a young picture in Instagram.
The image has been added to several bullies, allowing you to conclude that the musician is in the picture of a 16-year-old student at the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders a young woman looking at a serious camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's texting.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it from here.
Lampenius has previously published images of his past and has also spoken about bitter topics.
A fair year ago, he published a picture of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, the second he poses now as the mother of two children.
In his illustration Lampenius is considering his own growth as a human and refers to eating disorders that he suffered younger ones.
That's 20 years ago, and today...
I still look like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and about what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to English Hashtags life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-confidence, self-esteem, loved himself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating problems in previous years.
She was already 14 years old at the hospital because of her anorexia and orthorax.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which finally appeared only in 2006.
The healing started to slow down.
In addition to therapy and peering, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for the cuts he had on his wrists, which he said he was going to suffer after he fell in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder in the original murder trial of the prosecutors.
He killed Steenkamp in early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door through his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night caretaker who hid in the toilet.
The prosecutors have reported their intention to complain again, for they find Pistorius to be too mild for six years.
The State Prosecutor intends to appeal to the highest court in South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended for 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two of the illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of people encamped in Sidonia on the morning of August 1st, and there were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that he had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping areas and have already fines in place for all those encamped in areas other than the intended areas.
The inspections shall be continued until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced the right to impose a fine.
The stock in the Nest is sinking - we've already lost -7.7%
The oil-distributor Neste stock has fallen by 7.7 per cent at about 11.00 a.m.
Its result before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast of Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange has started off in a small way today, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
After the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had gone down by 0.2 per cent.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent after about half an hour of trade to 959.48 points and the most exchanged companies OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million was the morning profit and loss of Nesteta.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: diet with high levels of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable bowel syndrome.
A upset intestinal syndrome is an unhealed disease with about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the Washington University found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, research leader, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes do not hide in the body.
The cells that cause infections balance cells that strengthen tolerance, protect the body without causing damage to sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be an irritable intestinal syndrome.
Studies have shown that the immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacterioid in the intestine.
This bacteria needs tryptophane to give birth to the immune cells. Tryptophane is one of the building materials of the proteins.
\"We have discovered a link between the development of the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and the development of the tolerance cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal intestinal microbials,\" says Professor Colonna.
The more the mouse diet had Tryptophan, the more they had immune cells like this.
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobilis reuteri bacteria with a high level of tryptophan may enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
When examining the immune cells that strengthen the tolerance, doctor Luisa Cervantes-Barraga, discovered that although one mouse group had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbioma of mice, i.e. to the normal gastrointestinal tract of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the intestinal DNA was studied in mice, six species of bacteria were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobilis reuteri bacteria were administered in a sterile environment to raised mice with no intestinal microbiologists and no immune cells developed, immune cells began to appear on them.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobilis reuter bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluids – without bacteria – from the mouse to isolated immature immune cells.
Immune cells developed into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophane known as indol-3-acid acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen the tolerance increased by about 50%.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same resistant cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products of Lactobillus reuteribacterial cells can develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with inflammatory intestinal syndrome.
- We'll probably want to promote the development of such cells, because they control the inflammation of the intestines inside, says Cervantes-Barragan.
The high level of tryptophane combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalisation.
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United received a contract with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a deal with Nemanja Macic after making a deal. In Manchester United's lines, the middle field player debyttoed Sampdoria against Wednesday night.
The 40 million pounds from Chelsea began a two-to-one victory in Dublin, the last round of United Nations before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed the defensive middle-field player against the stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
But Matic was not in the best condition yet, because he was not involved in the tour of the blue shirts of Asia before the beginning of the period. He was only able to make 45 minutes on the field – according to Mourinho, there is a change before the election season began.
\"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and thinking methods make him a genius,\" says Mourinho.
We'd rather be willing to help him than later.
In addition to mathematics, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romalu Lukaku were about to start a game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to cut off his initial meeting for the beginning of the period.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants another three new players, even though the club has already done a great job, by obtaining three of his four priority players.
- Three out of four - it must be thanked by the company - he added.
- I'm more satisfied if I get all four, but they did an excellent job.
Airball women have been bullying Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost its fourth match in the World Cup tournament in Germany directly to the team 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine is high.

Reuters: A large jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr's meeting in Russia
In the United States, the great jury has sent challenges regarding the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian attorney Natalia Vesselnitskaya.
The great jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges regarding the meeting of the Russian attorney from Donald Trump Jr and Kreml.
It is reported by Reuters, the news firm, who, at the same time, reaffirms Wall Street Journal's earlier notice of the invitation of the grand jury on Thursday.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges to the meeting of the Veselnitskaya, known for the Trump Jr and the Kremml – held in the middle of the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr’s campaign manager then Paul Manafort and his son - in - law, the current adviser of the White House, Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has invited a large jury in Washington is a consolidation of the Russian investigation.
They add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in an investigation that seeks to find out about Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or cooperation with Russia in the area of cooperation with his area.
The great jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, sends challenges and forces people to witness with oath.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence found during the prosecution's investigation and decide whether the prosecution should be brought up.
A British inventor microsilent himself to get into his house and in his car with a handshake.
The British inventor has been the first to microscope himself in the whole country so that he can open his home door, get into his office and start his car with a hand swing.
The microchip is between the thumb of the 33-year-old Steven Northam and the front finger. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to facilitate their lives with Northam BioTeq technology.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, a consulting doctor at the Royal Hampshire Hospital, in the winchester Hans, in order to meet the medical requirements of microsiron installation.
The microchip uses the same technique as in cats and dogs' microchips, and its installation only takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. The handling of one lock costs 300 pounds.
Northam's married, and he's got one kid, and he's put microchip technology on both his home and BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
Your White House show cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The final decision of the White House to fly a pirate helicopter to the southern grass field of the White House was to pay the taxpayer $24,000 for the American production.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on his way to the White House in the event of the 17th of July 1997, where American building programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of white house officials were introduced to products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The White House Military Bureau had requested a helicopter to place only about 36 hours before its landing in the southern grass field with an exceptional event. This is reflected in the HMX-1 helicopter assistance documents of the Navy.
I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of the matter, because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility. The commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an e-mail to his superior on the day before the event.
It was reported that a helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field at 17.7.7 a.m. and the event would start at three afternoons. The helicopter would leave the site only after the lawn field was cleared between six and nine o'clock in the evening.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter was delayed from the White House, another crew would be required due to restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in a helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received by the TIME magazine do not make it clear whether another crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if there was a violation of the law.
One of our questions was whether this was a breach of the Hatch Act, and we were told not to break, the commander wrote.
- Sounds like you could attend, the deputy commander answered.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At that time, the president spoke in favour of the reform of health and looser state regulation that had taken place in the debate on the Senate.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their journeys,
But it's unusual to use them for photographs only.
Trump's actions took place in February when Air Force One launched the President's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented all 50 states of the American workers’ products made of American materials, ” said Lindsay Walters, the White House’s Press Secretary.
The HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice in the southern grass field with the accuracy of centimetres of the President's introduction to the White House.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 exercises for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America included a monthly training quota for crews.
The helicopters of the unit were also on that day for 11 hours in non-presidencies,
According to the White House, the event did not involve any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky reported that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation in the southern grass field of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to the duties of the President, and the precise assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
According to the Ministry of Defence's hourly compensation for 2017 the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is $2,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit's records, flights from Quantico base to the White House from the state of Virginia to the White House lasted an entire hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
According to the level of compensation, it is misleading to calculate the costs to the payer,\" says Walters.
The required level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called 'confirmed' costs, which are taken into account in the annual allocations,
According to the report of the RAND Research Company in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former press secretary of the White House Sean Spider defended the helicopter's use in the event.
The idea is to introduce American production, Mr. Spider said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thus employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other defence supplies that many Americans have worked hard on.
It is absolutely appropriate to point out:
It's not certain if Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the fire truck driver's seat.
In the White House Trump was joking to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
\"I know Sikorsky very well,\" the President said. \"I have three of them.

The State Prosecutor of Venezuela requires the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that last Sunday's vote on the elected representative is to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a delegation was elected to the country, which may, among other things, amend the constitution of the country.
According to the Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the rejection decision has been requested due to election plagiarisms.
Ortega has also started the vote on election surveys.
He appointed two judges after the British Government which organised the vote on the vote told us that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro’s allies were on the terms of representation, and Maduro’s son and wife, among other things, were the elected representative.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the delegation may break down the Congress conducted by the opposition and amend the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the constitution to be a tool for Maduro to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representative is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
There's a lot of people wounded and over 100 people are dead.
Venezuela fell into economic crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to show the opinion on Friday, when the new representative is to begin.
A Russian man given by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States.
On Thursday, Minneapolis court sentenced Maxim Senah, a 41-year-old, to nearly four years of imprisonment from participation in global computer intelligence.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the request made by the United States.
According to the Russian magazine Fontanka, Senah had been vacationing in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border authorities when he was coming home.
In February 2016, Finland gave Senah to the US judicial authorities despite Russian objections, reports AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah got 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lamented Finland hard after the arrest and said that the man should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that grabbed dozens of thousands of computers all over the world.
The virus was used to fish for user names and passwords.
After that, the Hustlers used data by continuing to direct internet traffic, which provided clicks and spam distribution.
According to the Department of Crime of the Ministry of Justice, according to Mr Blanco, the case shows that the United States is also capable of chasing other active cybercrime.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the press.

The third production period for Narcos starts on 1 September.

Kola makes a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building of the Unesco headquarters and the Globe monument represented by it.
In addition to the light, I would like to highlight the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the welfare of all of us.
With my art I can make important things concretely visible, says the light artist Kari Kola from his work.
I am very proud of the invitation to be involved in the first international Light Day and bring light art into the theme, Kola continues.

I feel very privileged to re-establish my art at Unesco headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may still be greatly expanded.
This will be announced later in the coming autumn, Kola will continue.

Foreign Minister Timo Soni (uv.) published a blog titled with a question mark on Thursday.
The article is short, only two sentences in size.
In my day, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven representatives of the government.

According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women.
Elections are only representative if they allow all members of society to vote, including women, said the Head of the UN delegation to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Mr Nicholas Haysom, the interim director of the UN Assistance Mission, stated that hundreds of women are on the table in the election of the Regional Councils, three women are seeking to be Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
The role of women cannot be overemphasised, Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the electoral process.
The election of the Afghan Regional Council and the President will be held on 5.4.2017.
The Taliban has put forward threats to elections at the same time as the international forces are moving to an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power moves from a peacefully elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contributions strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan independent election board, 1.2 million registered voters are women.

The flooding threat of certain tourists to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local rage is particularly focused on the form of tourism for cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it “live and flee” tourism: it is only a few hours away and it is run through the great crowds of sights.
Venice is choking on quick day trips to city tourists.
In the narrow streets, it is difficult to move and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer be able to fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further from the historic center, while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian are writing about tourism problems in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist rates.
They call the current phenomenon \"low-quality tourism\" - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the flag guide to Piazzale Romamata Rialto Bridge and St. Markus Square, and turn back, describe the current and problematic tourism of the Italian Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the city's identity.
The story of St Mark also belongs to the most popular places of visit at the historic center of Venice.
The church of St Markus is located on the side of Torin.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 locals living at the historic center of Venice.
In 1951, the population was about 175 000.
In July, it was estimated that 2 000 Venetians against mass tourism.
They say that tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this goes on, in a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says that the demonstration was organized by Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring to Venice the income that it desperately needs and create the need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been designed to allow crosses to go further away from the historic centre.
In the view of Luciano Bortot, in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the municipality of Venice, where Venice is also located, was given more power to decide its own business, unless full autonomy.
Every year around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Bad traffic on the motorway
On a motorway between Kuopio and Lake Siiljärvi northwards, there have been miles of congestion from work on Thursday afternoon.
The area is undergoing engine road coating work, which slows down traffic, says Savo Sanomat.
In the case of road works, the speed limit is 50 km instead of the normal speed of 120 km.
Even in the 50 - mile - long zone, however, the traffic had progressed in practice on Thursday afternoon.
The road work took place on Thursday afternoon on the lake Siiljärvi in the case of the Golden Cave.
I'll get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to notice the churches of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful photos of himself in the landscape of Grand Canyon, among other things.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen in his current home country to become a popular athlete in Norway, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in March in a 400-metre running tour at 51.81.
A month later, he healed a 500-metre fence at the time of the Norwegian record 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, who used the hard social media, soon discovered that fame and publicity have their shadows.
Men all over the world began to send to Iuel the photos of their sexual organs apparently in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account from outside.
So I had to turn my account private, Iuel told the VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel didn't want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he got.
You can guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'm getting along well without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, his father is a Danish Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway with Amalie when she was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, because of her father's work.
After that, they were in charge of Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is training with the guidance of three trainers, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
In Norway, we are much more open to debate than in the United States.
In the United States, coachmen don't ask for anything, they just issue orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel is holding Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence.
The more snowboarder, Janne Korve, took the whole career to the stakes - now in the World Cup:
It's been nice counting now that nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, the 31st most successful snowboarders in Finland, has once again been able to enjoy their beloved species.
Last summer, the career continuation was at stake.
The strain injury on the table had forced Korve to operate in January and had no desire to heal.
His hand had been hit in the race.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was gonna do, whether it was going to continue on board or not.
Sponsoridils were broken, and many things were open, Korpi tells.
But that's what they say, things happen.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started to pull back to the chest.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it no later than the first time I went to the snow.
I was so damn straight, this is so funny again, we're gonna take a couple more ways.
The body was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long billing period, it's been a big deal.
There's only a few races around Korpi.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of Korvelle’s boarding.
I've never fallen for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're hot for the week.
I can't think that way, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi's race in the half pipe of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races don't like her on board, she's always on fire in a tough fight.
According to Korpe, the appreciation of the international ski race has increased over the last few years, although some of the boarders opted for the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races. The visibility's big.
True, in my opinion appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level in the competitions.
The Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-man team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's gaps, Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow up with the younger guys.
I remember when I was at the point where everything was new and so excited about everything.
It'll bring you a new power, Korpi will think about it.
I'm still on the front line, but by the way, no, there's a lot of power in the guys!
Janne Korpi has also built a different sports career behind the boarding career.
The guidance legend, the son of Peggy Korve, has become involved in the therapeutic sport: the director has his own hippopotamus for whom he does the training programmes.
When I'm on the road all the time, it won't be any more time for me to be in the messier.
But every day I look at at at least the food results and usually at some point of departure, Korpi tells me.
Nursing and therapeutic training are, according to Korve, a potential career plan when the drilling career comes to an end.
I'm not going to plan that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I'm going to experience it like I'm going to study it, along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay nervous and develop, and maybe in the summer, I'm going to run something.
If it's my future profession, it's not hard to start when you're already in the species.
The restaurant also includes the Eliteloppet resort to be organized with Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twin has rented a cruise ship that will head to the Elitloppet Competition in Stockholm at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to reinvigorate the old tradition.
The cruise has been very commercial, and people have been excited.
We're already at the point where there's no bankruptcy.
A few months still have time, let's hope to fill the ship, Korpi says he's excited.
Attendo's nursing project to Kitee has surprised everyone.
Attendo Ester is the name of the new nursing home for 41-placed people built for Kite.
The building of a large 1,700 layer square metre will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbor’s health road.
The theme of general surprise is where customers are sufficient for the new treatment unit, because now during Siu’s war, many private nursing homes can overcome the customer shortage.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Manager of Care Services, commented that Kite will in future have more demand not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought private nursing homes from Kite last year in Kanervikla and Eerika.
The deal was about business, but the real estate is known to be a five-year lease agreement.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move functions away from these premises.
More on the subject today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand of the Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the leaders of McVitie's chemist of long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Section of GMB Scotland, the UK General Trade Union has not told us about its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea plants have more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company that owns the McVitie's brand said that he invested in the factory over the last few years, over GBP 5 million.
The company added that the employees and the trade union must be informed first if there are changes to be made.
In its letter to the Executive Director, GMB calls on the company to respond to the concern that no funding has been provided for the modernisation of production lines.
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy is very concerned that the factory manager is not getting any clear information about the needs of Tollcross’s business and the investment plans for the future.
\"Family families have worked here from generation to generation, and the labour force has focused strongly on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income, as well as Brexit, the rising cost of living and the continued reduction in production, the eastern Glasgow needs successful McVitie's production with a great deal.
According to the Pladis informant, the factory manager had received a letter from the trade union only on the day before and the company is directly responsible for the letter, because it appreciates the continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
\"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we had open discussions on a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, the fact that, like other very competitive and insecure companies on the market, we continuously assess all our transactions and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness.
According to the media, over GBP 5 million has been invested in the Tollcross factory in recent years, in particular in its production lines and in improving its operations.
We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production facility, and we will be sure to tell the first employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the plant's operations.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret the interest of Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar once it has paid EUR 189 million for the termination of the contract, but did the PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most important event in the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of the colonial drums. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of GBP 89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best paid professional athlete, as PSG will offer him over 500 000 pounds per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the functioning of the PSG and the way Neymar has left the company. A source near Barcelona tells us that the company has taken great care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players in PSG about the euro.
“I’m not concerned because they know that if they’re after our players, we’ll become their opponents and contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
-We congratulate all the euro.
But if they're after our players, they're gonna have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have committed itself to this very point: it expressed its interest in the middle field player of the PSG Marco Verrat was earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances; it could well be that Barcelona is losing its star player to Neymar.
The Neste braked the stock exchange rise - Stock Exchange news - East Sanitary
The second great result publisher of the day, Metsä Board, was left with a more attractive fall.

\"I wouldn't say it was a lie.\"
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, never happened, reports the New York Times.
The calls that Trump has been smoking, both with the president of Mexico and with the leader of the patrol organization, have proved to be inventive.
The White House informant Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump and the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, had discussed Hamburg at the G20.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty tough charge.
Those conversations happened, not just on the phone, but on the face, Sanders justified.
The speech to the Boy Scouts was a wake-up misdemeanor.
On Monday, Trump told me that the president of Mexico called him and praised Trump for his successful illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that few of them would come across the southern border of Mexico, because they know that they're going to make a trip to the United States border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a notice saying that no such call had been made.
Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That's where Trump highlighted his speech at a large meeting of the national patrol party organisation in West Virginia.
I got a call from the captain of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the patrol organization informed me that it wasn't aware of the call of any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the report, Michael Surbaugh's previous statement by the head of the organization, in which he had asked Trump to forgive the patrol officers for his speech, speaks to himself.
Mr Trump's speech at the session of the patrol party gave rise to a lot of strangeness, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he glowed the results of last autumn's presidential election.
