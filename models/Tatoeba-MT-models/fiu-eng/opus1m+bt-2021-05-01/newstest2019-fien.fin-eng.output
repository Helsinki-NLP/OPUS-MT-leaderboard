Eemeli Kouki led Hurrikan's home win in the opening - Savo Volley, second victory.
Seven times in a row, the Hurrikani-Loima, who had been on the medals of the male volleyball, started the season 2018-19 at home, when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most effective of Hurrikan.
There were some vibes abroad, but they didn't work out, and then there was a call from Lima.
Pretty fast we got the deal, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen played in Loimus with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was a match-to-playing national team player named Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
It's always important to win the opening game.
Many players had experience from the opposite side, and it brought additional tricks to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal pipe is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
What I'm saying is that Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Mättänen was 18 points the most effective of Savo Volley when the team fell by Visiting Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was dazzling, especially at the end of the attack, but luckily we got a bit of a bit of a win-win.
At least I didn't have any known different downloads when I played against my previous team, Mättänen said.
During the next Airball 3 series during the 2000-01 career, Antti Siltala made 12 points.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuivinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was a small, or atmosphere on the roof all the time.
That's a good one.
Miro was the king, Sil also played a good game, that's what he said.
The previous season of Silsta in the league was 2006-07, then he won the silver in the Pielaveste Sammo when he was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective 14 points.
The Star of Aka Volley again, Mikkonen
In 2012-13 the league score exchange won Joni Mikkonen has started this period strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Aka-Volley took the season's opening profit after he lost the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
It's been a long time since your own place.
Today, of course, there was a loss near here because we had a fourth loss from 17 to 21.
There was a harvest, and the fifth lot came in the same way, which Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective of the tigers in the final match was 28 points made by Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrashovs supported with 17 points.
Didn't get much in the guy's search, Mikkonen complimented.
Finland in comparison with human capital the world's number one
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital, reports the Scientific Journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the peak was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, after Finland, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands were.
Later, Holland placed one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst comparison was between Niger and South Sudan.
In measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is considered.
The World Bank has focused human capital on economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois was in control of Atletico, the local game ended without goal.
Real Madrid goaltaker Thibaut Courtois stretched into the towers, and the local game of the Madrid team ended with a goalless tie on late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa, were the closest goal, but the Belgian guard in Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played in Atletico three times when he was a player in Chelsea.
In the first week, Fifa chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
At Real, the best destination was Gareth Bale, but his shot turned past the end of the goal's opening half.
Bale got replaced after the break because of the trip injury.
According to ESPN, the disappointed Reali supporters shouted out the name of Crisino Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
The United States is now attacking an abortion law - a powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out if one of the nine Supreme Court Members could be elected candidate Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by President Donald Trump.
As part of the Republican Party, many hope that with the decisive vote in Kavanaugh, a decision known as Roe against Wade could be repealed, which was made by abortion law in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reverse Roe - the United States and abortion rights tell us about the current situation over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soni (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and received support from the majority of our country's representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, the gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri, due to the tightening of the laws.
An armed clinic guard tells us he's defending the US religious freedom.
The news videos remind me of the deadly terrorist attacks on the clinics.
Let's move to a time when the abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Luterian association of churchmen directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasonings of the interviewed pastor are good, but not even necessary, the photo of the woman who died of the abortion itself is enough.
Death was in the United States in about 5,000 years.
The legalisation of abortions was in particular advocated by the Republican Party.
In 1967, in California, Governor Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law.
Later, in its 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan began to reverse religion into politics to undermine voters.
And George Bush, the parent of his successor, also passed out on his abortion record.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
The core document of the matter will be reached in search of the underlying cause of abortion being politicized.
When religious organizations in favour of racial separation were denied tax freedom, they became politically active.
They chose an abortion as a stick horse.
Religion has brought into politics exceptional knots.
In writing this, there is a situation in the United States where the voice of the religious right with its oral harassment has been chosen by President Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can gain power based on the status of Va'a-linguistic power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children at the border with great demonstrations.
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has fired protestors in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians on Friday in the Gaza Strip, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14 years.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made a air strike in the border zone when the protestors threw Israel’s troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that he has started using force, that the protestors do not break the fence or pursue it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza’s demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians began their weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Council, 12 000 people have been wounded.
The protestors call for the Palestinian families to enter the territories where the Palestinians had to leave when the state of Israel was founded in 1948.
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.
The explosives that have been dropped on the Palestinian side with the cuts and helium balls have set fire to forest areas and farmlands in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick. He couldn't shoot himself.
The Wigan's top couple, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have dropped him off with a hit-and-run in the punishment area.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
According to his interpretation, the cover was clean.
The Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation stayed in trouble for the divorce judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was killed.
Ward looked like a punishment blink, and Mario Vrancic was shaking a 1-0 net.
Santa's made five goals for Norwich in the Master's Series.
Last Saturday, the QPR was born in style with breast muscle.
The work was good for Puk again.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended himself without getting tired.
Norwich had the fifth match in two weeks.
The team's still in the league.
There's a five- gain tube behind it.
The pedophile aid service was immediately filled with reservations - around 40,000 people in Finland are interested in children.
According to the estimates, 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pretteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, children or young persons who are sexually interested have been difficult to get help.
The SeriE project of the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpon trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in spring, the meeting hours started at Sexpo providing advice and therapy, and the meeting hours were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a disgrace to many.
Most of the pedophilic feelings themselves have not been carried out by the fans and thus did nothing criminal.
However, the opinion is usually a permanent characteristic.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also make it difficult for a normal life, says Ylele's sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Core leaders or Congon gynaecologist?
As the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, U.S. President Donald Trump may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest winners of the prize.
The background has the role of Trump in obtaining North Korea, at least at the level of speech, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorites to be the Nobel recipients of peace are based on the odds of the South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korea's leader Kim Jong, who have met this year three times and who have promised to pursue a peace treaty between their countries.
It is remarkable that there is a warming between the coresis, since the period between last year was a good one.
Yet, the reward of Kim, which leads to the threat of nuclear weapons and to his country by iron, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize recipients are announced from Monday onwards, and on Friday there is a peace prize for the most attention.
If the prize is not awarded to those in the Korean peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor, Denise Mukwege.
The esteemed gynaecologist has taken care of thousands of women in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo who have been victims of mass rape and have become a leading expert in his area in the world.
Mukwege has been working to pay attention to sexual violence, which is the harsh side product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate was also seen as a UN refugee organisation which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has stated that this year, the award is awarded to 331 candidates.
The names of candidates shall not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he got the Nobel.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House whether he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said smiling.
I want this done.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, and the President continued by referring to North Korea's negotiations.
However, there are factors that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multi-polar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as opposed.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded by three US politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So to reward Trump would require a full ideological translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Car drivers behaved like compromises and drove in the wrong direction
Traffic congestion on the 1st Lahja took place on 8 September.
Transport in the tunnel area was cut off due to notification both to Turku and Helsinki.
When you found out that this was a system failure, the fire department tried to make transport normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it couldn't be opened because there are drivers in the road with a bag of silk and they drive how it happens, the top friend fireman Pasi Kääriäinen told him at that time of freshness to STT.
At that time, the motorway was going in the wrong direction even after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against the traffic rules, some others are often followed up, Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Transport Security, is confused.
According to the traffic regulations, the motorways and tunnels must not stop as a mandatory reason.
Transport security reminds us that, in exceptional circumstances, there can be no risk of road traffic being compromised by fast-track solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always be equipped with the most accessible means of transport.
In particular, driving on the motorway is prohibited in the opposite direction, as is the conclusion and withdrawal of the u translation.
The same prohibitions are also valid in tunnels where additional headlamps must always be switched on.
It is also prohibited to stop without a forced cause, as is certainly also parking.
There have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel with snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for this activity, Heiskanen says in the Road Safety Notice.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party, even if the ship was caught in the lake base.
Inland vessel M/S Ilves fans from Tampere would have liked to remain on board the boat to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrja, the ship’s master at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, ran out of his thigh late Saturday night and was stuck at the bottom of his heel in Old-water Aka.
19 passengers were on board and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in the men.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board until morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them to a fire station in a port and a bus home, Syrja said to the STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the game between Ilves and the HPK, which ended in the 4-3- gain of Ilves.
According to Syrija, Saturday's mate was due to the fact that the surface of the water in the Old Water was about a half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjan, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest sign was covered by the log waste, which meant that its reflectors were not normally seen in the dark bridge.
No more noticeable impact
The guy took place on the narrow west side of Jumusensalmi shortly after the boat route had subsided the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjan, there was no greater drama, since the ship was very low at the time of the event and there was no significant impact on the ground.
According to the monitor, the capture has not caused leaks or pressings on the ship, and the cruises of the ship appear to continue normally.
The diver visited Saturday morning to check the ship's proper condition before the ship was towed off the landline.
We're still on the dock to make sure there's no damage, Syrja tells us.
Syrja believes that the next M/S cruise, dedicated to next weekend, can be handled in an amicable manner.
According to him, the cruise period of the ship continues until the date of independence.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department was alerted on the case on Saturday night just after midnight.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of the branch to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
The sun-friendly fireman Matti Willman told us late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and quite a heavy wind.
The rescue facility in Pirkanmaa announced half-three days after Sunday night, that everyone on board has been evacuated and passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
In 1957, a crossroads built have been built in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The plaintiff of Trump, who has been accused of stunning and drinking, may not be a top official.
Brett Kavanaugh, acting Supreme Justice of the United States, may well remain silent in his duties, assesses the programme manager Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their study hours.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may be able to present himself to another person.
In the United States, once in a while, there has been a great deal of conflict between the President's candidate for Supreme Court.
In that case, the plaintiff has usually resigned, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
The name would be pouring into the stage of the Democrats.
The Supreme Court of the United States is seeking to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the choice of a new judge has become a very sensitive political process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to be taken by the Democratic Party in the forthcoming interim elections of Congress.
It would raise the level of voting among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of the Conservative Judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity for every presidential term, for judges of the Supreme Court in the United States will be appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired on their own request at the age of some 70 to 80 years.
Some of the Republicans also hesitate to name
The Supreme Judge of the United States is normally subject to background check, says Aaltola.
Even though Trump's only assigned a week's deadline for an additional FBI survey, it can still bring something essential to Aaltola's attention.
Yes, it may be brought.
Often there's smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is certain, at least, that Kavanaugh's suitability or inappropriateness for office will be discussed hard before the Senate decides.
Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republican sensors think they're suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
A woman has identified Salisbury as a military intelligence agent.
The Russian woman has told the BBC of the broadcaster to identify Salisbury's poisoning as an agent for the Russian military intelligence service of the suspect.
Based on the photographs, she told me that it was military intelligence with Anatoli Tshepi, a member of the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia told earlier that he had exposed other men suspected of poisoning to Chepiga.
In the past, they said that they have found evidence that men's current identity are covert personnel.
The BBC group traveled to a village near the border between Russia and China, where the Czech Republic grew up.
The woman who lives in the village identified a young girl from the pictures published by Bellingcat.
He recognized the man in the British police photos of a man who now called Ruslan Boshiro.
Russian men are suspected of being poisoned by former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March by Novitshok.
Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarded, among other things, with the honor of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspect's GRU connection.
Earlier in September, men suspected of poisoning told Russia that they were tourists in Salisbury in an interview with television.
Old people in garbage bags in war reform
There is now a live example of what the military reform limiter, defined by the Sipila Government, means in practice.
My birth-son Vaala's social services are produced by the Oulunkaar Municipal Council, the former regional director of Attendo, who has been elected head of health services in 2016.
The heads of the municipal association warn of the delegation of the change limiter.
If the cost of war is rising now, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central administrators of the municipality were scared, and the majority of them were prepared for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would stop the institutional care of the annual health centre and a small unit of memory diseases.
Home health care would be increased, which means long distances in Vaala that older people living in the outskirts of the outskirts are treated next to the health centre.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay its customers.
The Left of the whale was not a bad preparation, but a good public event with a lot of relatives, close-ups, as well as other parties' delegates.
I introduced the preparation of the Sote Region on the dias how old people are already treated at home at the moment in the entire North Ostrobothnia region.
Carina Läntinen was also authorised by the neighbourhood.
The local newspaper made a big deal about the opportunity, and it brought the Oulunkaars to their back legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers talk only about the service codes, but do not tell the level of care they receive or on what personnel structure Attendo will treat the elderly until the harvest treatment is completed.
Without a nurse?
In the name of the health centre, the premises are stopped because there is no night-care emergency.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at Vaala Health Centre.
An example of Valala shows how the central officials run the authorised officers with insufficient information and the authorised to point their backs against the wall with a change device.
In this way, the Central Party will eliminate the residents of Vaala, for who remains in a safe place to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was there one electoral statement in the centre that the whole country is considered to be inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a large-scale musician in Cologne
Thousands of people in the city of Cologne in Germany showed their opinion when the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened the largest Moscow in Europe.
A number of hundreds of people had been gathering at the beach of the Rhine since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of protestors, and the protests condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have been organised and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey, in advance.
Erdogan’s supporters had also gathered near the Great Moskei.
The police had, however, isolated the large area from the environment of the Musketeer for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdoga congratulated Germany on its visit and assessed its success and strengthening the relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday Erdoga and Merkel swore that they would rebuild their relations with countries which have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish Revolutionary Company for 2016.
However, Mrs Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including in relation to human rights issues.
Review surrounding the visit
Both the Mayor of Cologne and the Prime Minister of Nordrhein-Westphalia-Westphalia Armin Laschet withdrew their participation in the opening when the review of Erdogan's visit was accelerated.
The 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told me that he came to protest against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for people who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
To Erdogan, all that departs from his own thinking is terrorism.
During the last phase of Erdogan's German trip to North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three charges are charged for the murder of a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kucaki.
On Friday, the D.A. told me that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and this engaged bead, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have been suspected of a case involving the murder of Kucaki.
The case and the articles published by Kucika have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
The livestock distribution may have problems in decentralised areas on Sunday
Due to the error of printing, the Sunday’s Karelian will also have to be posted unaddressed.
This may be seen in the distribution of the magazine in decentralised areas where the distribution of shared boxes is required from foreign memory.
The situation was the same with regard to the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posts put extra leaf bouquets in the county.
Journals of other Finnish subscribers are only posted on Monday.
There is a significant delay in the distribution of these magazines.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The journalist, Mr Nyberg, is interviewing Vesa Heilala in its forthcoming debate programme today.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her coming space trip, which she already booked from the Virginia Galactica in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which required a bank loan.
If the original plans had kept their place, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unlucky test flight, which happened in 2014, and even the death victim, things are in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
The number of Vesa's flight is 300, which means his trip is about one year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and there are 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells us about its future homepage.
At the same address he also wants to background his space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel, and I saw Star Trek on TV.
The wars of stars have been seen, and that's what left the idea to be...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host
Manchester City continued its lossless course in Valoliiga when it fell on Saturday on its homefield to Brighton paints 2-0.
The sixth victory of the management team season is guaranteed by the goal syringes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to guide the fourth strike of the period to an empty goal, when Leroy Sané found him on the back of Brighton's paint by 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he saw Brighton back with Sterling for 65 minutes.
The Argentinean was able to invest 2-0-blocks from a penalty attack in an easy way.
With six wins and one tie, City will lead Valoliiga to 19 points in the catch.
However, only one point away from Liverpool, who played less than one match.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his seventh round match with Chelsea of the third series.
The Youth Associations elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations elected new decision-makers for their next three years for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected president and Vice-President Petra Mäkeläinen Häme.
40 real members were elected and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Associations will inform you on Sunday.
The Youth Society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu thus gives three promises in its three-year action objectives: We keep the doors open to all, and we organise a level playing field regardless of location and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own path to growth, Finland's Youth Associations report when it comes to information.
Lewis Hamilton thanked Kimi Räikkö and confused Ferrari: \"The driver of great importance will go away.
In the interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the Britishman of Mersu asked, he believes that the release of Kimi Räikköse from Ferrar's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton runs a Ferrari's second driver at the MM points at Sebastian Vettet at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Saber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think Räikkönen would hit gloves in the dishes.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining race.
He's an exceptional professional, fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorites, and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has told me before that Räikkönen has been one of his ancestors.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamed about the formula number one, I played the F1 game at PlayStation all day long.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian competition.
The race from the fast start at 14 a.m. will be launched by Mercedes Valtteri Bottas.
The evening paper will be watching the race at the moment.
The championship of the football A-Youth SM series became a full farce: only 7 players arrived
The top series level of football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
The starting points for the championship campaign, which began before 13 o’clock, were clear: FC Lahti Academy has a first-time space in practice against the Left IRK.
In order for the situation to turn around in the last round, Ilvesen, second in the championship struggle, must overcome PK-35 and hope that the bayans will lose.
However, in practice, before the start of the championship, the Iron IFK had arrived with the power of only seven players.
If there had been one less whale, the fight could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the 16-0 match.
On the break, the bayans led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Vastian player roof is that the team has played in part with the same players in the A-Youth SM series, the P20 series and men in the second block C.
The left IRK has played in the second in practice against the fall of the whole period.
During the 2nd round of the final round on Saturday, the Vasa IRK will have to win the JBK in a foreign match while hoping that Tampere United will lose his own guest match against KuFua in Toival, Lake Siiljärvi.
The car ended up on the roof of Enos, according to the rescue department, happiness was involved.
The passenger car ran out of the way and ended up on Sunday at the Consultancy at 9 a.m.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the rescue department informs me.
Well, good luck with that, the press says.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet after the rain.
The police department visited the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways of intelligence: designing equipment acquisitions and recruitments already made abroad is not slowing down
According to Mr. Antti Peltär, Supo's chief of staff, the intelligence team has been prepared to buy equipment and train staff.
As the law on intelligence enters into force, an increase of around EUR 10 million should be permanently added to the suppository budget.
In the office of the Defence Police (supon) located in Ratatadu Helsinki, full head is being prepared for the entry into force of intelligence officers.
Antti Pelttar, a Supo meeting-like chief, tells Western Media that equipment acquisitions have already been made for future intelligence missions.
Serena Williams is making the video that he sings in high school, campaigning for breast cancer awareness.
The superstar of the tennis, Serena Williams, will meet again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video of Instagram in which he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, reports the news agency AFP.
The programme is the 1991 Hit I Touch Myself of the Australian The Divinyls.
The video will support Australia's breast cancer.
The Divinyls is the world hit to remind women to regularly perform self-operational [breast] checks, Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women in the world regardless of color.

Chinese restaurant with mountain top is not suitable for heights
In addition to traditional Chinese deliciouss, the restaurant serves wonderful views.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang in China.
It is literally located in the stone language.
If you want to, you can look at the forest that's spreading down there.
In high altitudes, restaurant visitors get a breath of life in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires a walk in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for visitors on 19.9.2018.
The Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is.
You need good ground condition for a restaurant, we'll tell you where you're going.
Korpela's alley runs out today: this is how it ends.
Everything's gonna end well in time.
Today, this is what happens to the native country drama of the Korpela alley, which has been quite maintained.
The third production period has gone like hot stones: last week, 722 000 Finns were watching TV as their first performance.
The top classes themselves no longer have any practical significance, as the Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen series are not going to continue.
At the final stage, the relationship between Pacific and Mirku is once again taking the amo exercise forward, and the mother of Peace seems to be the first to guess what I'm going to think is coming.

You want to go to work tomorrow in a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The Flu season is hot.
How many scars do you think you're staying home or not?
However, it is worth considering whether it is advisable to go in and infect others because the disease can be contagious even if its symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly attack, sometimes they appear in the hips.
In the latter, you may already be infecting others, even if your symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
So you think you should stay home?
Prevention suggests that even when a person has no symptoms, the flu is contagious.
The virus is infected by the day before the symptoms start and from five days to a week.
Children may become infected longer than they are.
As soon as you recognise the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can return to work when coughs and fevers are no longer, says the medical professor Gregory Poland.
It is also worth avoiding training.
Too fast to get back to the gym slows down the recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, put your noses on them and throw your towels in the trash.
But when you're sick, do you?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the head area.
That's when you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
And the instincts are also limited to the mask.
Then how can you avoid infection?
The best way to do this is to still wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult for the latter to avoid.
In the United States, for example, average man touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.

In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year distance, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning triangle and that would make a career open to me, I don't want to believe that it would in any way affect our relationship.
Even if we have to live separately, we have a good trust, and the good thing about distance is that it begins in the first place, Alina in May.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
A boxer Robert Helenius's fight against Erkan Teper is a shadow of money.
Today, East Sanomas news Jaakko Helmi and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila of the challenge application, where Helenius and his late interest rates will receive a fair amount of EUR 80 000 unpaid manager fees.
By application Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helen 15 April 2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to settle this, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and the work has been done very much, Kokkila says to East Sanom.
The current manager of Helenus, Markus Sundman, sent the evening magazine in exchange for an account of the events of the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies being obligated to pay the amount required.
In addition, Kokkila and Helmi had provided their services in an economically bad situation to Helen and promised to be able to arrange for matches and sponsorship.
On the contrary, it was agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay fees only percentages of his matches.
Again, it was assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, but to receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice of professional athletes in manager operations.
It has never been agreed on and it would have been absurd in the situation of Helen, Sundman, to find out in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
In addition, from the beginning Helenius would have liked to have agreed the distribution of income in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman received the draft only at the end of 2014.
He stated in his own view that the proposal was bad and that he cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helmi.
Helenius did not once engage with Kokkila and Helmi.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenus had been assigned an unidentified but extensive decline in the work of the manager.
This year, the case has been raised with the same arguments.
Helenius considers the subsequent activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be poor, in return.
Today, Helenus meets the IBF's heavy series challenge list at Erkan Teper Stuttgart.
A hearty man and a good reporter
The entertainment artist and the music producer Ilkka – Ile – Vainio felt the late radio driver and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long line radio driver and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 with an incurable liver cancer.

He reminds me of Päll's being a loved person with fast hot dogs and funny stories.
I learned that Erk was already a little boy when I first went to Finnboard when I was 12 and started there as a warehouseman.
That's when Erk and I met.
He was then a Finnboard informant and in various tasks, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I was going to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Päll was a standard editor at all the parties.
He was always expert and I could see how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, she got directly to the skin of her interviewers.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
For many, he became familiar with Yle as a radio driver, but he also wrote great newspaper stories.
Erkki interviewed me many times, too.
He was good to talk to you.
Over the decades, Pälli also worked as a journalist in Fazer's record with Tope Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the greatest passion of the day was the radio work with a unique style.
From the 1960s, he had radio work done, and he became familiar with numerous hearers at Yle's ether.
The day was retired in 1998.

The Russian Dimitri father and mother-in-law Svetlana believed their daughter was successful in Miss Finland.
The parents of Miss Suomen Alina Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov followed their daughter at the end of the first hour.
They smoked the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's wonderful!
Well, we used to believe in Erik all along, but half an hour before she got here, Svetlana was laughing.
Svetlana is an angel and Dimitri's Russian.
Alina talks about a smooth Russian even though she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than in the career of Missie.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - remembers the idea of a cartoon: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
In the past, the organic temple was left by my husband's instructions, in which he suggested it as a person to the story I developed, says the espoola cartoon blogger, mother and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo reports that he was an EU translator in economic and legal matters in Brussels until ten years ago, after the fourth child, the family became a returnee.
I've had a great time as a mother-in-law.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me to remember what it would do when the baby even started to be big.
Then the 2014 photo became a cartoon.
The pipe tells me he never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tint and Asterix on a small scale.
I had been drawing it last when I was a kid, but when these organic manuscripts began to be born, the situation changed.
At first, I made some tens of manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (p. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I didn't get her to be attracted to it until the summer of 2016 when I bribed Vivi by means of a drawing board.
His zeal lasted a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying, laughing Piippo, who tells him that the drawing plate was a great incentive to him.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
I didn't even try to draw the paper, says Piippo to draw his relationship, which he usually does in the evenings.
The manuscripts remind me constantly, but usually I don't do the writing at a time.
It takes even more than an hour to strip one of the three squares.
I might make a screen at a time, and I'd be happy to play with the color.
It is always the hardest thing to start to limit, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo tells me that he appreciates newspapers from modern series including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The animals are people of L-telemaa, a carrot-haired mother with salad-haired hair.
Other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the natural world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer an obsessive shortage, even though there is a thing going on in the organic atmosphere.
The whip says he's got a series of his men and children to read.
After all, it's such a wonderful feeling when you look at the cartoon and say that I've done this today.
And there's plenty of challenges for my mother-in-law!

Indonesia's earthquake: The pilot sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were secured.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old flight leader, has become a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung stayed on his own in the control tower until he was able to safely get hundreds of people to transport the passenger plane from the affected island of earthquake.
The youngster was on his way to the air traffic control of Mutira SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city when the earthquake struck on Friday.
On the other escape from the control tower, Agung refused to leave his place before being able to steer the runway of the Batik Air passenger plane into the air.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, and the Indonesian aviation department told AFP.
Mutira SIS Al-Jufrie Airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower was foaming and cracking.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping to the tower from the fourth floor.
His leg broke, and he had severe internal injuries.
Agung was thanked for being in a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported in helicopters to the facility, but he passed 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, the aerospace agent told The Jakarta Post.
The earthquake continued to intensify the flight, and its strength was eventually measured as 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn was thinking about the end of Europe in Yle's trade war:
The trade war between the US and China is reflected in the global economy.
In all Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth assessments.
President Olli Rehn said in Ylen's first victory that, although there is no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects investment decisions by companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe has so far been a bakery.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has contributed to calming the situation also with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be cooling down on the feet of the trade war.
We'll have to look at the next twist and assess it afterwards.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in Yle's interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most debt-to-GDP countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
Yesterday, the market was very much responded by the Italian Government on Thursday night to clearly present the deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of the national product.
Mr Rehn considers the situation in Italy to be a source of concern.
Five per cent of the country's loan portfolio is problem credits and there is more than 10% of the outstanding loans.
In addition, its public finances are in weak positions and the country seems to be once again exceeding its commitment in relation to its European partners.
It may not be a good idea to paint new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied, when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it was in a row.
There would be a much more negative impact on the gap.
Rehn started as Director General of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), withdraws after a fair year.
The debate has begun on his successor.
The name of both Rehn and Erkki Liikanen, his predecessor, has been flaming in the speeches.
It is no problem if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that we are not going to comment on this further.
HS's super popular Black Box performances continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by the Helsingin Sanomas will continue again in the week that begins.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on 2nd, 8th and 11th October.
October 23, the Black Box is visiting the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere presentation has been sold out.
Tickets sell Lippu.fi.
Journalists and photographers on stage during the evening will tell a long story they have prepared, which has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's something else that no one has ever heard.
“There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the earth and a story about a very current health issue, ” says Esa Lilja, one of the Black Box producers.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the HS suppliers and photographers and to continue the debate.
Helsingin Sanomat has arranged the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been in the viewing room.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala for a year's journalistic act.
The prizers thanked new ways of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come near their readers.
Spring season 2019 The Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March to April.
The presentation is also available in Tampere and Turku.
The presentation at that time has different contents than in the present-sympic evenings.
We found a missing fungus as a result of an unpredictable experiment.
The Finnish police know-how about drones is the world's top:
According to a police officer at the University of Police, the police can use drones not only for the search of missing persons, but also for crime scene investigations and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to track down the drone of the missing fungus in Rahab in just a few minutes.
President Kimmo Himberg of the University of Police University mentioned the case and mentioned, among other things, that we are at the top of the world as a result of an unprecedented trial and effective training.
Drone's a very new crisis, and more recent than that in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that make the Finnish police a master in the use of drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong idea that this is the case.
This has been clear, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
I'm really interested in it somewhere else, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to visit the drones of the Finnish police.
We're asking for training.
Further generalisation
Himberg reminds us that finding the missing person in Finnish winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As you can tell, in the case of Rachel, the lost body was found with the drone only in a couple of minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to hermberg, they're supposed to be trained for more.
Even now, drones are being used much in police duties, and their use will become more widespread and will increase in the future.
That's what I'd dare say. Himberg's telling me.
In addition to the search for missing persons, according to Himmberg, the police can use drones, for example, in an accident or a crime scene investigation and in certain types of intelligence tasks.
For example, we already need to check some area a little further, where there may be fear that violence will be encountered.
Drone may then be used for preliminary information.
Karjalan Rugby rose to the top of his body.
Karelian Rugby celebrates the victory of the 2nd division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of a fight at 7-12 kills at the Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a plot in the second period and bashed south guests from 26-12.
At the same time, the Master of the 2nd Division knew the historic rise to the 1-division of Karelian Rugby.
In the past, the club has played first, but at that time the Finnish Rugby serial activity was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-part 1 division.
The Society intends to receive a serial location, but it will know quite a job next winter.
The current poor twenty players' roster must be raised to 25.
1-division also knows about the increase in the number of games and longer gambling trips, so the purchase of funds must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi begins the period in Montreal, strengthens the head coach
The head coach of Montreal Canadiens playing hockey in NHL Claude Julien confirmed the company on a Twitter account that the Finnish shocker Jesper Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved a super promise on Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with a number of three summer bookings.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength from the end of the summer and has put forward strong extracts in September's training games.
Kotkaniemi managed to finish the goal immediately in his first training match.
The head coach Julien congratulated the Finnish people on having taken major development steps after entering the new camp.
The NBL regular series will begin next week against Thursday night in Finland.
Montreal meets in the opening round Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader?
This week, Finland has talked a lot about leadership.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Nokian Government, reported in an interview with HS, the Paranoid optimism in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Olila.
Ollila strongly contested the accusations, but even in previous Nokia reports have also talked about the inability of the leaders to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, which caused the collapse of mobile business.
The company's risk-taking capacity and agility disappeared.
A week in Helsinki, a giant business event was also held at the Nordic Business Forum, which drew the company’s business cream to the Fair Center.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, there were 12 business stars.
The word for good management was enough.
Gary Hamel said that a good leader should dare to take the company to the future even when it goes well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally bound to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the Three Foods trade chain, known as the wide organic selection, said that the manager should be able to communicate with the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that can't be simply a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, a successful introvertist, reported that the most successful leaders have studied humble.
They act calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often they're introverts.
Aswath Damodara, professor of finance, recalled that the qualities of a good leader must be hit by one step in the company's life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A mature company needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These programs in the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7 500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
As a threat, they had a flash of information.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That's why management goes so often wrong, including at the highest level.
There were also Silas and Olila.
They used to talk to each other about each other.
But they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived in a magnificent red carpet from Los Angeles to spend most of his years abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the Missifinal in a beautiful black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress was also made of lace.
A little bit of a jet camp.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
Long time I spend most of my time there, Chafak says his famous.
Chafak tells me he's going to L.A. for auditions.
He's been doing a commercial film, among other things.
In the United States, he describes himself as interesting, and also as in Finland.
While working harder, he said, for the model is always easy to find replacements.
You have to dress harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The Danish police found a big Volvo in the operation: \"We can't tell you what...
The Danish police's extensive search has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Juhintiruma and Ison-Belt.
All transport of land and ferry from the island of Sjärland was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the head of the media centre of Copenhagen police.
Found the car.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet. Henrik Storm of Copenhagen police report to East Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo sought has no direct contact with the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish extra Bladet told the police on Saturday's information conference.
Detective Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was on the run of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell us what criminal code is used to investigate it.
However, Skov told me that this is a serious crime.
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they're already caught.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on cargo transport have been withdrawn.
The Copenhagen police were also following the events with their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the public is no longer concerned about the threat to certain people.
The name of Macedonia has led to decades of disputation - now the people will vote on this issue in a controversial election
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on the proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the Treaty of the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of northern Macedonia will be named.
To date, Greece has prevented Macedonia from being a member of NATO and the EU from being a member of its veto law.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern region.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter in Macedonia is in favour of membership of the EU and NATO by adopting an agreement.
The vote began directly at least at a school in the centre of the capital of Skopje.
The retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted in school, wished support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change especially for young people, he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts with the independent Macedonia in 1991.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the Agreement.
The national right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for the referendum to be boycotted.
In addition to the result, it is sufficient to see whether the voting effort will rise by more than 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but yes or no gain would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The Greek Parliament also needs to approve the agreement.
The polling stations will close at two o’clock in Finland.
That's a good win!
Robert Helenius knocked off Erkan Teper.
Robert Helenius met late on Saturday night at Erkan Teper's heavy-duty professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnish man took his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, a corner of Stuttgart.
The main event of the evening was the heavy intercongest interclinetal match of the IBF union.
Its winner may be able to take on the toughest tasks seen on Saturday, whose economic importance is significant.
Helen solved the match in the eighth round, when she knocked Teper with her hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
\"Nordic Nightmare\" already hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German nose started to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to be fighting already in December 2015.
That's when Teper pleaded for injury and withdrew from the fight.
Then it turned out that the German had run twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career matches and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went out as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
With Hamilton's stable order to win - the difference I already took 50 points
The Formula One Master again approached his confirmation, as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton won the Russian gp and stretched his MM-point to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are five more races left.
I'm pulling away Valtteri Bottas from the fast stop, driving for the second time.
Last year in Sotshi, Bottas, who won the opening of his career, kept the first place in the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to get past Hamilton.
The Vettel drove third, the fourth quarter of the Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen.
Red Bullin Max Verstappen, who started the last line of departure, was the fifth.
The twin assaulted a drunk man in Joensuu... caught a block away.
Two men abused a hit and kicked out a 31-year-old jubilee in Joensuu at Siltkatu 12 on Saturday after 6:00.
According to the police, men also took the victim's phone, among other things.
The police reached out to the suspect, i.e. a 35-year-old man on July, and a 39-year-old man on a merry-mantle, soon after the event.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, and the police are telling us.
The victim was injured and did not require a visit to the doctor.
The CEO of Tesla's electric car company Elon Musk will leave his duties as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
The Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has imposed a fine of 20 million dollars on his receipts that he would have ensured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock market.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Muskia of a securities fraud.
Misk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is established in law.
Canada is fighting time to reach agreement with the United States of Nafta
The time has come to an end in negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement with Nafta.
The United States has set the deadline for Sunday, and the country's negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
The Canadian prime adviser, Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
President Donald Trump called on the United States, Canada and Mexico to open negotiations about a year ago on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement in Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been born.
The United States and Mexico wish to enter into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign an agreement at the end of November - whether Canada was involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to allow the US Congress sufficient time to evaluate it.

There was no fire at the scene.
Police caught 11 people after the Honka-HJK fight... ..distorting in the field and in the subway station.
The police caught 11 people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match on the football league in Espoo, the Police Commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The reason for this was to protect against crime and interference.
The persons who were taken were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
It's about the mortgage that I told you about last night's Sanoma.
The fight ended between 0 and 0.
After the flooding, a large number of viewers rushed into the field from the view reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to push-ups and fistfights between team supporters.
In order to put an end to the situation, there was a need, among other things, for horse police.
In addition to the field, an exorcism occurred in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the arrests occurred.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was so uncomfortable, Värtinen referred to the filth that took place in the field.
According to Vertinen, no criminal report has been made as a result of the events.
On the table, a butterfly was embarrassed by its SE time in the world cup, Laukkanen was also in the finals.
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöyätävi have moved to the finals on the day of the 3/7 competitions in the swimming world cup in the Netherlands.
I'll swim in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS’s Table stone was embarrassed by Finland’s record in a 50-metre butterfly shower, where he was originally second in time 22.82.
Previously in September, Pöytävi swede in Helsinki on the journey to SE on 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liuknen, representative of Cetus from Espoo, was a butterfly smoker at 24s in the time of 24.68.
The Swimming Club Vuokati Laukkanen was at the beginning of the 50-metre breast swimming in the sixth time 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the beginning of the two hundred meters of confusion, Laukkanen had 15s in time 2.14,25.
Students play a rare touch: the tragedy of ancients - the mere Oresteia affects their visuality
The tragedy of the ancients is rare in Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filottes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought to the tour of the National Theatre an ancient drama trilogy, Aiskhylus Oresteian, which was the only whole.
In the Lavas open in 2015, the theatre high school actress students work internationally with the professional supervisor.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere night of Oreste was awarded in Berlin in April.
Roiha's reconciliation of Orestea is a close story of the ending of the destroyed Atreus family's blood collection and the birth of the rule of law, worth a good hour, in particular, twenty minutes, by summing up the choir shares.
The work manages to be very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simon’s great summer (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theatre's pages reveal the appearance of simple and bright acting.
Its center consists of dynamics between the exhibitors leaving the choir, acting as role roles, and the choir.
It is used for both double and triangular roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, which returned from the Battle of Troiya, and of Kassandra, will be shown at the stage, unlike that of the ancient performance strategy.
Of course, the presentation does not highlight its loyalty to the ancient performance strategy.
Rather, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text, which is constantly conscious of its ritualist roots, is created in the eyes of the viewer.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a close group of Master Stage Actors as a group, just as a single organism, a group of rhythms.
Especially in choir shares, very expressive, sculpture-like group formations, actors tend to be exposed to their rights, only by decorating the white curtain, at the scene.
That's impressive.
The Orestean tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures his first hydrogen loader
The reform will start to appear in Europe, in particular thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyinda and H2 Energy from Switzerland.
According to the cooperation agreement published in Hannover's IAA benefit-car show, Hyundai will deliver a thousands of cars batch of news from the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing a fuel cell truck on the market, Hyundai will continue to use Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as the manufacturer of hydrogen cars on the road.
With this quality, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly seeking to expand the market area for these vehicles by, for example, monitoring the development of the fuel grid, in Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor, said that the contract was publicised.
The fists swam on several occasions in Kajaan
A little over 30-year-old man assaulted three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and on his behalf on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside of the restaurant, which led to his removal.
Outside he pushed another man into the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser still hit him.
Police picked up the assaulter.
At the police station, the man was still aggressively acting and kicking another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
He was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is examined in three cases as assaults and as a violent opposition to an official.
In the middle of Kajaan, there was also another assault event on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old Cayan man hit the victim.
A little later, another man fell him on the ground, and the man who struck him in the past still kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the assaulters away from the victim and the police called.
However, they had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking witnesses to contact the Kajaan police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at study.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Erkki Pälli is dead
Ylen as a long-term journalist, Erkki Pälli died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radioman Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealed liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Oh, yeah, it's okay.
The doctor has said that, I live day by day, he commented on his situation in the evening paper a month ago.
The safety of trade aunts and cets must be guaranteed
For the first time in 1984, I was paid for a newspaper case.
When you're surprised by a story on these rings of years, it's usually a big news issue.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and, in the meantime, even a little angry.
I also talked to the talk about the Trade Union of Services (PAM) work environment expert Erika Kähärä.
He says crime statistics don't tell us what's real.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, argue otherwise.
The police only report cases that have been clearly serious, and many real violence situations remain unannounced.
The company has, of course, the obligation to keep statistics close to it on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and they are not collected anywhere, he said.
Spiritual injuries do not end up in statistics.
There has always been a problem in violent situations that do not always cause physical injury.
However, mental traumas can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a violent situation in which there is a threat is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threats must also be counted as violence, even if there is no hand-to-hand approach.
Too many people are afraid of doing their job, even though the real thing doesn't happen.
Some areas of residence are restless.
The store has acquired security.
Even when the opening hours were released, the media had a large amount of influence on the safety of sellers.
At that time, many employers arranged security services for at least night's emotions and alone to prevent work, Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, a false conclusion will be drawn.
This would seem to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, because of the security, the alarms remained in good condition, the idea was that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
A minor abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been abused does not want to make an inquiry into a criminal who is usually living in the vicinity of the trade.
However, according to the law of 2011, minor abuse becomes subject to the prosecution if it takes place at the workplace.
I think we're going to need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is being assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecution should be charged.
If the court were to put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence out of there was a heavy sentence, then the customs would be cleaned up.
A society where the grocery store has to be open for almost a day in small localities must guarantee the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed up for the miss before he started a live delivery - Sara, Iiro is then married -
Miss's coronation this year is not seen in the traditional way on TV, but on the Viafree site.
The former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios host Iiro Harjula.
The backstage and the red carpet are run by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the plotting team informed the incoming visitors and media of the progress of the shipment.
At first Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh welcome.
Now all women race!
Now look at this man-in-law, Mr Sohlberg cheered his colleague at the cheer of the audience.
The leading races follow Miss Finland in many previous years.
Among other things Sara Chafak and Sara Siepp sat next door and Sohlberg threw a little joke one way or another.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg would be reading in front of Sara.
The more probably Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Sieppi who laughed at the comments, even though at first he seemed confused.
For the first time, he spoke of his divorce in the magazine of the weekend of the East Sanomas.
Missikaunotar told me that he did not want to open up the reasons for the difference more clearly in the public, because it is between him and Roope Salm.
He said he wasn't in a hurry to have a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own things, and especially on my own life, Sara Sieppi told me.
The marriage status of Harjula came forward at a later stage when Sohlberg was accidentally mistaken to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as a parasitic.
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Janni Hussi signed off.
The northern man tortured his cobble mate by cutting, burning and feeding a powerful saucer
The District Court has condemned a 34-year-old man who lives in Kokkola for three years in prison for a large number of open sex crimes.
The crime-making tool included belt, cable and zippers.
The court condemned these objects to be lost to the State.
Rank's charge was about a suspected serious rape.
However, this prosecution was rejected by the court.
The cause of the Kokkola was four assaults, gross assaults, coercion, illegal threats, crime of liberty, a serious crime of liberty and two crimes.
The crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May last year.
At the end of the last few acts, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Northern Ireland issued its judgment and ordered a 34-year-old to continue in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-olds were also accused of two serious crimes of freedom and of serious rape committed on May 22.
However, these accusations were rejected as untested.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the District Court gave a public statement of the judgment.
According to the conductor, the accused had been subjected to violence, threats and sanctions against his spouse in situations where this had been committed.
The accused cut off his victim with a knife, burned with tobacco, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
With its judgment, the court ordered criminal instruments lost to the State: belt and cable, zippers, a bath belt, a knife and a knife.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together.
It can be read that a large part of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four Witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The 34-year-old victim should receive compensation for pain, suffering, and temporary harm of a total of EUR 5800.
He barely has that money because the convicted person has debts from his old age in his inheritance.
Prisoner punishment isn't the first man.
The afternoon magazine does not mention the convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.
This is not the last time you're writing a law firm.
Europe in the lead of the four points Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals held their lead on Saturday in a traditional slot game against the United States.
Europe is leading the Ryder Cup in Paris at 10-6 when there are twelve games to play on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four of the four-table games on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-table the winnings were equal to 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Mr Molinari, who won all four pairs of games during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, none of the European couples had been able to do so.
On Sunday, the two of us strive for more history.
No European player has won five points together in Ryder Cup, and no American player has reached as many as three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
In the Honka game, the HJK condemns its supporters' violent harassment: \"The government is not part of football,\"
The football team HJK released a release on Sunday to condemn the interference of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
\"We will discuss the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters,\" says the report.
At the end of the fight, about 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to try and argue with Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers were not able to calm down, but police, as well as horse police, were needed.
HJK reports that the team's players and employees are upset about what happened.
The events after the fight are not in accordance with the values of any of our association of 111 years of age.
“We are very much disposing of all the activities that jeopardise the safety of the match, ” says the Communication.
HJK promises to help public authorities and event organisers to identify safety-threatening factors and to address mitigation phenomena.
The culture of support is part of football and important to the HJK.
We are in every way supporting positive, happy and encouraging activities in football theatres.
- It's not part of it, it's said in the press.
A Philipian inventor flys a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
Mendola is a Phillipian inventor, hip-hop dancer, and some kind of Pelle Pelton.
He's now part of a growing crowd in the world who swears he's made up a flying car or at least his own version of it.
For example, as competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, the man has used a large part of his property to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he did the first successful test flight, he flagged his machine at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope the device will cause positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said to the British Daily Mail.
JHL prognosis: Labour struggles start tomorrow are visible in day care for children and in social and health services
In public and well-being areas, the bans on overwork and exchanges will be reflected, in particular, in social and health services and in day care for children, the JHL President-in-Office of Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and they will certainly appear in the way that there will be insufficient staff on the ground.
Everyone has to think about how they're going to get their kids.
It is now up to the employer to take care that the services are playing and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine tells the STT.
According to Niemi-Lamen, the shortage of workers was also seen at the beginning of the year when JHL members were in overwork and turn-overs due to the contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility that staff has not been hired, but workers have been overworked or changed.
This isn't a work struggle yet.
It is a standard standard for every employee to be concerned about and only for regular working hours.
JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce the protection of small businesses' dismissals.
Markku Jalonen, head of the local labour market, does not undertake to assess the effects of over-work and exchanges.
However, he does not believe that they are very mutilating, although services can be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have prepared what is being done.
The area is so wide-ranging, social and health activities and the technical sector, it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week experience has already been gained, among other things, on activities of three days' duration, which were similar to those of the Super and Social and Health Professionals Organisation.
Their effects were rather limited.
JHL's ban on overwork and exchanges concerns, inter alia, municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
Family day care providers, for example, are excluded.
The struggle at this stage concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Lam, JHL may take a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other work struggles if the preparation of the letter of dismissal continues.
The government should now admit that we're running into a wall and hard.
Jalose believes that both the Ay movement and the government must stand up.
It's very special here that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though they haven't given the show yet, Jalone is updating.
Great Corallirity is created in the fitness circles of children and adults to learn the passions and the organs of the sea horse.
In other places, the Great Corallirus of the College received its first evening in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kannelháza.
Like the previous works of the group, Great Corallirius is a work that is built together with the public from the beginning to the end.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and thank the findings made in the initial exercises.
There is also enough magic in the theatre for child participants.
The child’s point of view has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
However, the great Corallirius is not a performance for children, but a performance by adults and children in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations on how children can receive and make art.
Children’s ability to engage in exercises and concerted games will also dissolve the distance between adults and children.
The great Corallirus is similar to a kind of fairy tale, gymnastics, and nature-related information strike, but ultimately it rests in different, non-human conditions around visits.
The great coral reef begins with access to the business lines of corals and living organisms and fish.
Six different fitness areas teach, among other things, ray and sea horse gesture.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour, where music, light, and shiny paints and suits will help to get to know about the life of the coral reef.
There are both divers who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals we look at.
There are also coral - considered organisms.
The eyes and observations shown in many directions make the performance frequent and life bulging.
Whether it is the landscape of some organism, the landscape - and the body - or the landscape - and everything at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem so hard.
In other areas, the group is working towards the limits of thinking and action to which the group, when it consists of both children and adults, is challenging.
On the other hand, being involved with children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitrator will have a quiet demonstration on behalf of the endangered corals.
Man’s understanding should not be allowed to harden, even if it may be difficult to understand the significance of his own practice of compassion in front of the prospects for destruction.
In other places, the work has been built in such a way that it respects the diversity of life as well with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species, and future generations of whose wonders and toys it is a messing space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad my childhood had no smartphones
Today’s children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking younger and younger all the time.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess with their lives because of drugs and sex because others say they do.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me he had to get his sister in fifth grade this weekend from the boyfriend.
When she came to get her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned all our childhood that we shouldn't touch drugs and that sex is a grown-up thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood, and that they will not have to grow up too early due to the group pressure created by friends.
I'm constantly seeing younger girls in Instagram, who are in their pictures wearing makeup and revealing their clothes on their heads.
The Snapchat is used to pick up and send images that are exposed at night.
It's more difficult for girls to guess what age they are.
Today’s 13 - year - olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood was made up of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood wasn't smart phones.
I got to be a kid for many years, and I didn't have to think about what everyone else thought of me.
Yle: Public authorities have told the Government that the case of Airisto Helmi does not relate to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed Ylen, the Defence Police and Defence Forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Councils earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been informed that the Airisto Helme investigation is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime, reports Yle.
Ylle, Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (cok).
According to Kanerva, this week the defence forces and the defence police went to the Defence and Foreign Affairs Departments to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were quite strict that they did not speculate that there was anything else, Mr Kanerva commented on Yle's interview.
According to Ylen's data, there has been no evidence of a connection to national security so far, but the investigation is still under way.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from there, says one of Yle's interviewers.
A week ago, large-scale domestic searches in Turku and the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere form of financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the afternoon magazine produced a case that reviews claims for and against both sides.
Video: The dream painting saved Liverpool's losing series
One hundred percent of Liverpool Valoliiga's start came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with team 1-1 on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away for a 1-0 visit.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent the entire Valolithian signal that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers the end of the last season.
And surely the Liverpool Manager Jürgen Kloppi arrived with the same idea for West London.
The Reds had started Valoliiga with six consecutive profits.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virginia van Dijk seemed to rule alone at his own end of the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had below Wednesday's fine league from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the change bench to solve the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, as soon as the beginning, the Hazard was involved.
In 25 minutes, he first played with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho in a small space.
Finally, the Croat saw the Hazard descending forward and sent it a fully weighted breakthrough.
Hazard ran a little off the edge of the penalty zone, but he bombed a perfect left foot to the rear corner of the bet.
Pool Brassist Alison was a little slow in her fight and didn't get her finger like a ball.
The club certainly felt the defeat position lightly unfair because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger fell Mo Salah’s guidance goal finish.
During the second episode of Chelsea, Kepa got into reality.
The Baskivahti quickly responded to the petition of Sadio Mané and pushed the ball from the tortoise to the corner.
On the other end, Alisson, in turn, zeroed his failure to drive through Hazard.
The best place for guests came in the 72th minute James Milner found his focus on Bobby Firmino.
However, the Brass Star suit was directed toward the national teammate David Luis, who saved the host's leadership.
It couldn't last more than 89 minutes when the exchanger Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 metres.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of the top corner of an irresistible bet.
The one-to-one-one-one-one-thin-the-sadic start in Liverpool has come to an end, but it's still way too far-fetched, together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the top.
At the time of the transmission debate, the posters are deep
I remember a decade ago, a magazine asked various Finnish influences, which divides the Finnish people.
The only answer left to Mr. Leskisen: the Nen terminal.
Some of the last names have a nose-end and some don't.
Jakolinjoja could be born anywhere, and here was one waiter.
Finland has achieved the EU's abandonment of the annual shift in the clock.
A lot of people agree that double the shift of clocks a year has been the job of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems at least to be the easiest step in the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
It is now most difficult to determine what time it will end in time: the present summer or winter or another time zone.
This will also allow the people to express their opinion on the protagonist website.fi.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is fervently held on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their say.
The defenders of winter time justify their views with a morning light on the welfare and summer time of the people, with an impact on the desire for people to go abroad and thus on the welfare of the people.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Research has also shown that morning light causes the day of man to rhythm and to give relief.
On the other hand, if there is no particular problem of waking up in the dark, more light for people to move out and give more opportunity for autumn yards, for example.
The extra light has already been calculated to an hour after the normal working day.
I'd rather take both, but bad for us to be in the north corner of the earth, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
A typical debate on this issue is that its own view is being driven and that the second is very much opposed to it.
The argument of the opponent is not very much to listen to, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on this matter, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn the other's head.
It burns the gunpowder.
The issue is a very easy debate, because it does not require a great deal of coercion and that there be enough mud to justify it.
In general, the same type of matters are debated more strictly and equally infertilely.
Well, it's a shame if the wrong choice gets chosen, but I don't know if you'll fit in.
And it always provides an appropriate scapegoat if life feels so cold.
Josba fought for a full-blown guest win
Joba's first guest game in Salibandy Divar produced a total of three serial points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki to the joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) with a victory.
Nurmo was still leading the goal at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47 the brothers Eedu and Juuso Lehtiniemi collided with a 6-5-powerless goal.
For both teams, crucial minutes were played with a tie.
Joba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The 2nd chain was hot by the way, when Teemu Cinderella (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three sets.
Next up, O2-Jyväskylä will be with you in two weeks.
200th anniversary of Eno Church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be held on Sunday in part in a very sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the devastation of the Church of Sanctuary was a shock.
Even Eno's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, it's still a party place today.
Even if no one would like to, Eno’s church is now the oldest church of the Joensuu Congregation Society.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart in spite of all the union of the world.
The family fair begins at the church of Eno at 10:00 p.m.
After that, we move to the congregation house by the cattle table.
It's been a day since the program has all kinds of things inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be consulted with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who retired 37 years as congregation master.
The birth celebration of the church also means the end of one era.
The already decommissioned congregation house, built in 1982, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we're in an ex-conservation building, says Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the Tesla Government's speech to the president's office - Petos' charges were set at $40 million.
Tesla and Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car manufacturer, have agreed legal proceedings with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority SEC.
SEC suspected Musk's fraud in securities, and Musk was in danger of being set aside for the company he founded.
Misk can, however, continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, the Musk will have to resign from the seat of the Tesla Chairman for three years.
The company will have to hire the chairman of the external government.
The muscle will also be subject to tighter surveillance.
According to the agreement, Tesla must hire two independent directors and monitor Muska's communication in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay USD 20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
The aim is to prevent new market failures and harm to the shareholders of Tesla, says Director Steven Peikki SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
The suite just raised Tesla's share rate.
SEC suspected Muski had committed a fraud.
According to the Agency, TV was false and misleading and Musk had not talked about an arrangement with the company's other management or potential donors.
In practice, the Agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that he was suing the company and Muski to court.
SEC claimed that Musk will be sentenced to fines and that he will no longer be banned from acting under the leadership of listed companies.
The SEC's challenge was for investors, and Tesla's shares went into a strong decline.
More than 800 people died in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
The number of deaths in the earthquake in Indonesia and subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, reports the country's disaster agency according to the AFP.
It is believed that the number of deaths will continue to increase, as there is a time to deal with the damage.
According to Vice President Jauf Kallan, the final figure may be rising to thousands.
The historic earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the town of Sulawes.
Immediately after the shock, Tsunam was given a warning, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least for the time of Palus.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Donggala, which is located close to the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Now many people are already known to be dead.
Irony Requests for Help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers look for victims.
President Joko Widododon, who arrived in the exterminated area today, urged soldiers to continue their rescues without getting tired of the day and night.
One of the centers of rescue is the hotel on Palus, which is still thought to be 50-60 people in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, Head of the Rescue Office, reported that one person was found alive at night after the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, popular for business tourists.
We also heard people's requests for help. He told us.
According to the Syaug, the quarrying and the tsunami area would quickly be used to dig up heavy decomposing equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of disruptors in Britain
Many British politicians were victims of harassment when their contact information leaked out due to deficiencies in the encryption of the application.
The bullies reached the ministerial telephone numbers, among other things.
This was the application used by the British Conservative Party in question.
For example, Mr Michael Gove, Minister of Environment, Food and Rural Development, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, became victims of harassment.
A number of MPs have received alarming calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were conservatised in the mobile application of the annual meeting.
The public was able to access profiles using a politician's e-mail address, which was easily accessible online.
The profiler was able to view and edit the data stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson for a moment's profile picture of porn and titles as insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to a picture of Mediamogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian’s columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows entry into other people’s profiles with these e-mail addresses.
Then the loginer can view the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in this name.
The meeting application was made by each supplier, politician and participant in the telephone number of the public, Foster criticised.
The conservator's informant's informant has apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and that the application now works safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) supported the data leak.
The application was prepared by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The opposition's Labour Party criticises that Conservatives cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, the Wall Finland audience has a large number of vulnerable Polish people.
The Wall Finland viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience.
In the world, the rapidly spread US format The Wall landed on the Finnish version of Nelos last Saturday.
Heikki Paasonen's most hosting game show is described in the same studio in Poland, where the format also makes other international productions.
In the Polish studio, the opportunity to describe was exceptional, as the size of the format was 12 metres high as a game wall required space.
During the start-up period, social media highlighted the programme’s studio audience, which was thrown into Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the Polish people in the studio might be able to understand anything about the game to be played in Finnish.
The Head of Four Homeland Programmes, Unne Ringune, illuminates the issue for the evening magazine.
He says that the studio audience has a close range of players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The public is made up of international killers in Finland, just as the generals of The Wall in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, which appear in the descriptions of the different programmes, the ring background.
He recalls that following the game itself is not so obvious, even if it does not understand the language by which it is played.
Red and green balls falling off the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, there are translations for foreign - language studios.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events all the time as a simultan interpreter for the studio controller.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of plug is going on there, for example, and what's going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with that of David Hasselhoff in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago involved in Talent Finland's descriptions we have in Finland.
He had an ear all the time for a simulation, and he knew everything he had to say in the drawings, the sum of the Ring.
Japan’s south-west brawl is moving toward the main island - the authorities warn us of earthquakes and floods
The authorities also warn against possible land-fighting and flooding.
There are at least 50 people injured in the Taifune Tram, but the authorities say that major injuries have been avoided and so far no information is available on the deaths.
In the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so heavy that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated to shelters, and more than 300,000 electricity has been cut off from households.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullets are in place because of the storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka half a day near Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the storm’s route, but there are also hard winds and rains.
The trains have been canceled in Tokyo today.
According to weather scientists, Trami is tormenting Japan until Monday.
The sky of the heavens continued to darken
It's been a bad start.
As the team lost its 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3 1) in its homefield, Vaasa Sport, it was almost dark.
The pores now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points in total for six rounds.
None of the Aussies defender or a two-lower chain player has made a goal yet.
The weights also grow all the time.
Against sport, you're gonna be able to smell as much as you can when there were almost half of the game left.
Six games are only played, and there is no reason, of course, to give up.
Of course, you have to be careful, because that's how weak we played.
In particular, the second batch was a shame, and the Ässi power 1+2 made Jarno Kärki told.
Of course, it was a victory for sport.
The team had a game down on Friday, so it would have thought it would be visible in the making.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors on the day of the bread continued to increase
Pirkko Hyärinen, mother of the day, wonders the audience of the event at the big hall.
In some ways, it was thought that maybe this year, not so much people would come, that the Good One would think about it in the morning.
In autumn 2017 Traktorky's SM competitions were held at the same time with Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would make it possible that the audience could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it did occur; the corridors were already pampered before ten, the sellers told the product was finished, the news stock was sold more than 500 doses before, and even in the number of cars, Hehärinen heard that there was an increase.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6000, says Hylarinen later this afternoon.
For five hours in the morning and afternoon, there was a particularly large amount of program for families with children, which, I think, attracted them to a record list.
In addition, Heyrinen estimates that the event will go further.
The sellers also map the Liper every year from the larger area.
This year, the present-day presentations, handicrafts, pastries and harvesters had arrived to the baker almost 100.
The mother of the day of bread, Pirkko Helrinen, yearned for the audience from the hall.
At first, the bread day was blessed with harvest.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the audience's voice.
11 different types of bread arrived at the Children’s Bread Competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the brown bread competition, spent a day in a martian pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful light - from this you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space for life, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read the eyes without getting tired.
It's worth raining for a good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
Vinkit gave Innolux's sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniem.
Do me a favor to your eyes
The more age years there are behind the increase in the importance of lighting.
Sufficient light can help people to cope with problems with age when their vision is reduced and more and more distressing.
The need for light is also increasing for parents.
A six-year-old needs a light three times more than a 20-year-old.
So it is worth pouring out on the effects and the characteristics of the light for health reasons.
I'm going to give you enough light, but not enough light, Jokiniem's tip.
Create Beauty around You
The beautiful interior can only be found with the right lamp solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
There is an elegant, Scandinavian style that combines Japanese and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrotyl, with strong colours, different metal shades or ice creams, has also been inspired by the 70th century until the boom.
The authenticity is fascinating in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is invested in the house now than before, and the decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want their own home adjusted, even a brave whale with a story to tell.
People apply clearly for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious,\" says Jokiniem.
It may not be possible to obtain the latest trend light at home, but the timeless classic for which it has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, coveted and elegant classics hold their surface year by year, says Jokiniem.
Thank you, and good-bye!
KoKoo showed the door to the Canadian player after three games
Kooko and the attacker Brendan O'Donnel are breaking out.
The Canadian player played a total of three league games in orange blacks without any power points, Kooo says in his information.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoho in August with a one-year agreement including a trial period until the end of September.
In the last period, a 26-year-old attacker played in KHL in the lines of Kunlund Red Star and in the KHL farm at KRS Helongjiang.
There's no information yet about the new company of O'Donnel.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - the stuff goes to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic went to the paper.
The special game business Player is currently recycling not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of stone-foot shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycled materials.
Products ordered from online shops are packaged in packages from importers, for example.
All the packages that we've got are going to be reusable.
We may use boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in order to be able to use it, Ville Puurula is told about the gamer of Oulu.
As soft material, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials as a rule.
They'll avoid the bubble plastic as far as it can be.
In the near future, we intend to move to recycling material in the envelope.
The movement wants to set an example for others, too.
Recycling is not an additional effort, according to Puurula.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, packaging is re-used.
In addition to new products, the main product range of the shop includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
For each fashionable purchase: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classical clothes work from time to time in a different outfit than in a dress.
They create the basis for a good wardrobe with their multi-use, as it is easy to gather different costumes around high-quality classics at a cost.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes the black pole.
Black needle made from natural materials on half-carcases cannot be an error in purchasing.
The clothing can be combined with direct pants, a knife and jeans, and you can create both a controlled outfit and a tailor-made style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic sophisticated style artist.
I saw you create a style.
The autumn's trending book is made of gold browns and broad-sleeved blinds, black semi-ones and gray ankles.
The classic semione with the other classics, the blue-green Scottish radish and the wine-red licence, constitutes a womanly and sophisticated outfit.
Bring it to the black half-breed by combining it with trendy clothing: jeans skirt, high boots and thick stockings.
Young and stylish!
There is a long tradition in the sabotage of Russian intelligence services
There is no reason to assume that the foreign intelligence of the Russian Federation SVR or the military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, sabotage activities were specialised in the so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from Russian-speaking words in the Diversionno-razveylenja group: sabotage and intelligence group.
The experts of the Soviet security service KGB in the western countries prepare detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century.
These included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil mills and gas pipelines.
In Germany, KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for cover operations to the DRG groups for the purposes of Bundeswehr, the railways, the lorry guards and certain factors.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they were dressed for local Ukrainian police riots, set up inspection stations for those leading to Ukraine and separated Crimea from their mother country.
During the Cold War, agents hid supplies of mines, explosives, lighters, and media for sabotage groups.
In 1998, there was still a KGB's hideout in Switzerland, which was exploded when the authorities sprayed it with water guns.
Police caught four DUs in the county at night
Police caught up on different sides of North Karelia on four bikes between Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man in the continental region blew up 1.57 promotions.
He drove for two passengers at midnight at the beginning of Kajaaninti.
The Kuorevaarant on the knee of the lake smote its car at four nights, and a 19-year-old local man in the car alone blew off by the police as 1.54 Promille.
He didn't have serious injuries in the exorcism.
A 20-year-old foreign-occupied man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokummu blew the alchemy at 1.33 as a promille.

The real story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice.
An American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
The movie last night is done on the basis of that.
Everest now gets his first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the devastating snowstorm surprised the climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 guide tells of the survival record, which has been treated with cereals.
The tragedy has been made in movies and documents before.
We're going through some real events on this case, too.
The highest mountain in the world, 22 years ago, was taken by eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced travelers: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as the Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could have saved an eye surgery before he left Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost sight, which is why peak conquest had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never returned again.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had just begun.
As the storm got up, he was lost and was no longer able to find his way back to camp.
When they came looking for a man, they found him in such bad shape that he wasn't believed to survive.
Weathers was left to die.
It's like on a miracle store, however, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The badly burned Weathers were still thought to die, and again he was left to his own happiness.
Clearly, contrary to other expectations Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even along with the trollers began to believe in the possibility of helping him.
In film, Beck Weathers plays Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, we've been celebrating the 200-year-old Eno Church.
Enon's 200-year-old church has been celebrated at the church hill today.
The church was made available on October 4, 1818, and the celebration year was celebrated on Sunday.
The party began at the church hill of Eno at 10 a.m. at the family fair, after which there has been an antimale table at Eno’s congregation house.
The church was full.
The family fair was attended by 517 people.
Eno’s Church Lord Armi Rautavuori was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to the work, Rautavuori (in a picture) says.
The fire of the church of Kiilusvaara has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the congregation of Eno.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest Church of Joensuu’s evangelical Lutheran congregations after the fall of the Church of Kiivulysvaara in the fire.
The trees were completed in 1770.
In the morning, a charter was held at the festival, which silenced and recalled the destroyed church in the fire.
Photos and videos: The Median flashed power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street became a river
The powerful hurricane-type symorphism sprang from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
A Mediterranean hurricane, called Zorba.
The Greek Institute of Air Science has given a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnes, the Ionian Islands, Kykladien and Crete.
The images taken from the area show a lot of floods around Greece.
The Twitter video shows the sudden appearance of the river between the houses in the city of Kiato in the Korinthia region instead of the street because of floods.
The second video shows how the car's been carried by flood water.
In the southern part of the Peloponnesus peninsula, a heavy wind caused a strong shipping.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people to prepare for the storm in Greece on Facebook.
The mission calls for the monitoring of weather information and local authorities' instructions.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings with it heavy rainfalls and even flood danger.
According to a 2011 survey published by CNN, the media only appear once or twice a year in the whole world, typically on September-October routes when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm now left its floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and to Europe.
The care of Greece has also caused refugee camps on islands, such as Lesbois.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
In the summer, the storm will also be subdued by areas that have been destroyed by the landtops in Athens.
In Greece, the medician was also jogging in last November.
We must not go to the sea now, but the flights are still scheduled - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the island of Greece threatened by the storm.
You should be careful to cancel your trips to the sea, even when walking, not to fly on the storm.
Such instructions have been provided by guided guided to a fair 3 500 Finnish weekend on holiday in Greece through sunnuts.
The guidelines will be needed, for even the Zorbas storm that comes to fear-reading has been predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed may rise up to 45 meters per second.
The rains that make the weather more hostile.
All persons travelling to Greece via the Sunscapes and Tui to Finland who have notified their telephone numbers have been warned by tour operators about the tough wind by SMS.
In the air, however, sun and heat
According to Inka Ikosen, an expert on day-care communication, by Saturday evening, holiday destinations have been avoided from the worst.
For example, flights have landed and have risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we'll be following the situation all the time.
Let's go ahead of security.
I supported the media operator Antonia Schroderus, who says that their flights have also been scheduled.
We are constantly in contact with our staff at the scene.
At least he still had peace in Crete, he told me about the beginning on Saturday.
The most popular in Greece, i.e. Rodokos and Crete, currently has a total of 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, some hundreds of passengers are on vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island will reach it on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rodos, the sun had been mocked and the temperature was at 27 degrees, says Ikonen.
Zorbasen has been estimated to move to the next Turkish series, although slightly reduced.
We have already had contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tui, Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Hussi have completely identical evening suits at the Massifina - this is how they react to the situation
Media person and fitness beauty, Janni Hussi, arrived at Miss Suomi on Saturday in an open-ended evening dress.
Hussi tells me he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great suit tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening suit had also been chosen by the runner Shirley Karvinen.
The twin himself also noticed his similar costumes and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told East Sanom that he had to get ready for preparations, and he had to get on a plane.
The Hussi works as a backstage and red cappet driver in the Missile, and he's talking about the stars that arrive at the scene.
The Hussi has a fresh move back because she moved from Kamp to Jätkäar on Friday.
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
It's essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thinking.
Before moving to Greece, Hussi went on vacation alone.
It was wonderful. I was only in the hotel a week without leaving.
When stress broke out, I got a flu, but by the way, the vacation was really successful, Hussi tells me.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention to the curious views of retired people.
The drinker and the year 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told Miss Suomi in the red carpet that she had enough to do with radio drinks and Love Island Finland.
Even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final directly from Finnair flight has been sufficient.
I made a dress and put the hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
At home for the night dress exchange, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he's pulled his makeup out among retired people.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people looking in the mirror.
I was amused at least by others.
Karvine flies to Spain once a week.
He'll spend about a few days at the same time in Marble.
Karvinen tells us that he has enjoyed his nest as a fan of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as a stop until now.
Karvinen tells me he's been screwing up the program's singles on Friday.
It's kind of rough.
These are real human feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program's singles.
How am I gonna put up with the upper knees?
Three perfect examples
Classical clothing are clothing that work from the period to the other in the dress.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes the most modern individuals can be found.
A few years ago, the excess boots that had been raised into the hit-and-runs of the autumn season have not gone away.
According to their name, the boots on the knee are repeated in style from year to year.
The boots appear to share user opinions, but it is worth testing for a courageous model, well - boldly.
In fact, the upper decks are suitable for all kinds of costumes.
Then it's a farce, lace, gypsum, or a trig, and a simple booty skin or artificial skin surface works.
Long boots look good in parties and everyday costumes.
Black over-polven boots are also very suitable for tender costumes.
They properly balance the femaleity of a pink, flowerish pink tooth and a tender, soft needle.
A fresh but autumnish everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retrohenic housing is produced from a long copper-brown sage, over-fly boots, display earrings and a rivet-long bag.
Although there is a certain fineness in the upper shelf, they are also perfectly suited to the relaxation of everyday life together with the T-shirt, the long shorts and the trendy box.
It's so easy and still so stylish!
Two robot cars are starting to run in Espoo
They've been operating for the rest of the year, taking passengers on board, the City of Espoo informs them.
The Otaniemi robot cars play a role in the role of the bus simulator, as the next spring in the region is intended to start transport on robot buses.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
We'll find out how the robot cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Transport Manager.
For the first time, robot cars travel completely automatically among other transports without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of a passenger sitting in a ride.
Vehicles can sense their environment at all times on several different sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If this is not the case, they will explain whether there is an obstacle to the vehicle, the bicycle or, for example, the snowflake, the CEO of the Sensible 4, Harri Santamala, responsible for the development of robot traffic.
The robot cars travel throughout the autumn on three days a week: Tuesdays from 13 to 15.30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 to 15 p.m. and Thursdays from 10 to 15 p.m.
The robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on their way.
The stops of the robot cars identify them as parking tickets.
I'm sure you'll be able to get on the bus from parking in Otakar.

The Mokoma Society informs you about the surprising situation on its Facebook page on the Tampere Pack Room.
The work of the Mokoma Society at the Tampere Package Room received a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the appearance.

The rest of the show will be taken care of by backup.
Mokoman fans respond with concern to the photo update, where the bassist-sant is lying in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, there was quite a lot of concern about how bad it happened.
The relief is great, the bones are getting better in time.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
And thanks for last night's great job was, but you promise to leave such strong dramatic gigs out of it? write a fan.
Police were monitoring hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and Suomen riistakeskus in northern Karelia and Ylä-Savo, police forces reported social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was the legality and authorisation of hunting.
A hunting card was checked for each hunter and a hunting permit was required for the state's countries.
In addition, the holding permits for hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of cartridges for self-loading weapons used for channelling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the monitoring period, and only one hunter was met during the surveillance, who was missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was assigned 12 days of unauthorised request.
In addition, the police blew 133 vehicle drivers and two of them were suspected of riding a bike.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, a police procedure.
In conclusion, hunters are very well bound to follow the permit of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by supervision.
One hunter found that \"I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits,\"
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in autumn, together with other supervisory authorities.
The mute goes to Turkey to follow the choice of Syrian quota refugees
Foreign Minister Kai Mykkänen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to follow the choice of quota refugees to Finland.
Finland has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selections are usually made a couple of times a year, involving representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey for interviews.
The United Nations Refugees Organisation (UNHCR) first selects people in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly ill situation in refugee camps, such as single parent families, disabled people and sick people, women and children.
In the future group in Finland more people are selected than there is in the quota, because in practice part of the group is not available for various reasons.
It is also a mute way to go on the road to the Turkish Minister of Interior, Süleyman Soylu and Syrian NGOs.
On the trip is also accompanied by Ilkka Salmi, Office Manager of the Ministry of the Interior.
Speaking of raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1 050 per year, but since then there was no agreement with the government to raise it.
The meeting has supported the quota increase, but the project has recently fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently presented a gradual increase in the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
A mute visit will be the first in this period of government by the Minister for Internal Affairs to follow the choice of quota refugees.
Former Ministers of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risik (kok.) have had time to move on to their new duties before the visits were made.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU per refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now, we're going to go to the hacks... and they don't know if they're crying or laughing anymore.
Last Saturday, Karjalainen announced a bill for the amendment of the Animal Protection Act.
The article took the view that the bill essentially prohibited as production animals, pets or otherwise as business activities for all animals that are not individually authorised by the Ministry regulations.
In other words, all other animals, except those specifically mentioned in the Regulation, are, in principle, prohibited.
If the bill ends up in law, then it should mean that we are rejecting the general principle of non-discrimination, which undermines the safety of society or the good manner of society.
We are, in principle, putting in place the prohibition of any action to which the law or regulation does not expressly authorise.
This change is due to the fact that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business activities and to do nothing else before the law or regulation that has been adopted.
Government activities in lawmaking have generally been weak.
If we go to the road now that, in principle, everything is prohibited in Finland, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or to laugh.
I don't think the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But the legislative project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but it is likely to adopt such a procedure, which is prohibited by law or regulation itself.
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tip: The four most trendy skirts of autumn
This autumn's trendy view comes in snake tissue.

Kimi Räikkönen ungrates the reason for Mercedes' better than Ferrar.
Ferrarin Kimi Räikkönen was admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russian gp time.
However, there is no reason to sink into the panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but none of this is a big deal.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend, but they were just too fast, the fourth time they drove and their stable partner, Sebastian Vettel, who clearly missed the Mercedes pace, said Räikkönen.
Ferrar was already having a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
They asked me what the equal fall was due to Mercedes' rides.
They seem to be going faster than us... so simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don't know anything more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time rare treats were seen with regard to the coming stable of Räikkönen, Saber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced you with a Ferrari next season, was seven, and the last time session was also attended by Marcus Ericsson.
For Swedish drivers, the tenth place of departure is the best for more than three years.
And even though five drivers were left with nothing to go on in the second driving session, the final result was a good result for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging the future of Räikkös?
Yes, if you compare it to where they were from the beginning, then a step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see.
It was in it - Robert Helenius knocked off Erkan Teper: “Robbe is back, ” he said.
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match at Stuttgart's night, so I made my move on a flat sign.
The German was the most initiative party in the ring, but he didn't get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius controlled the match with his hard series, who found it very well.
Finnish was also clearly better in physical condition than Teper.
Finally, the solution came in the eighth round, when Helen struck Teper on the left.
The hit was so hard that the pick-up guy who got in front of the home audience didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was a very moderate fan.
At first, during the field interview, he congratulated the public on the feeling of good feeling and opposition.
Then he changed into a Finnish for a while.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish promoters.
We got a belt taken today.
Helene was happy right after the fight.
It was a great victory for Helen's career.
Perhaps it would be possible to even get to the World Cup, Helen commented on the evening paper before the match.
The killer would have decided the whole boxing career instead.
Of course it's come to mind.
There's no younger one here, Helenius, 34 years old, admitted before the Teper attack.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may be multiplied
According to The Guardian magazine, the vice president of the country calls for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jauf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Severe circumstances
The saviors are looking for trappers as well as dead people in the worst affected areas on the island of Sulawes: I ask the port city and its neighborhood in Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palus, there is still no clarity about the situation in Donggala.
Hundreds of people are missing and around 540 are injured.
There are still people in the sort of buildings that the saviors haven't been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Paluu has fallen.
The saviors report that they heard the screams of the people trapped from the ruins, but the lack of a scallop has delayed the beginning of the rescues.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered an army of rescue and loathing.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as in the disaster area, electricity and communications are in many places.
Fuel reserves are also growing.
Miss Finland's delicate response and long reflection caused the laughter
The Billnäs Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview round, a question was asked to every Misses.
The finalists pulled the question of a bowl of glass on the stage.
In particular, finalizing the number of six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the scrupulous response received at the time of the present audience sweet but kind laughs.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that was read by a misficientist.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a long time before he started making hesitations.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I've read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
A break of thought was granted to the public at the time of laughter, until Anttikoski continued her response:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something about economics.
So the last book I read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttikoski was given an audience with fresh applause in a laugh.
In the past, on a missionary tour, Anttikoski paid attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00 when the crown will be abandoned last year by Miss Suomia Michaela Söderholm.

The statistics symbols do not attract friends - four facts of popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admirable?
The researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two slightly different types of \"coolity\": generally attractive colloquisity and the opposite dissidentism.
According to researchers, attractively Cool people had many socially desired features: they were outward, friendly, friendly, and qualified.
On the other hand, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion and rain for the dissidents.
They were thirsty for experience, and they only cared a little about an external evaluation.
Both types combined a good sense of self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of Kovis on top of the cool: a high status in a teenager does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is how the US study published in Child Development in 2014.
Young people who dated early, were partying, seeking for the good-looking ones and seeking to benefit from others were at an increased risk of using drugs and getting into crime as adults.
In their human relationships, they did less well than at times with their unnoticed peers.
A high-end status with a high-mailing lock on the slippers, badges or bells do not make a person cool or, at least, genuinely attractive to company.
In a study published in August in the Social Psychological and Personality Science magazine, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with their regular market shirt than with those dressed in their shirts, despite the fact that most of the people opted for their brand shirt at the time of their visit.
If you're on a trip from Greece, watch out!
It's about to be hit by a storm of terror, a weather warning calling red.
During the end of the week, there may be as much water in southern Greece as in Finland during a six-month period.
The Zorbas horror storm hits Greece during the weekend.
Book if you are in the areas of Peloponnes, the Jeonian Islands, the Kyklates or Crete.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Embassy of Athens reports it on its Facebook website.
According to the Embassy, the Greek air science service has given the regions a red weather warning.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service in the Forecan blog.
According to that, the strongest hips in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Because of the comparison, Finland from the first week was hit by the Kusma storm.
However, according to the Blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind but rains.
The weekend in southern Greece can come over 300 mm of water.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of a storm on Facebook page.
Zorbas storm has caused floods between Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize Love Island - Anku, a man’s crag?
Played with confusing YouTube videos
It is rare to know that in the Love Island Finland series many men’s chanted beauty Anku will also appear as an abstinence star in the YouTube videos published in 2010.
On videos Anku advises askartists, among other things, to prepare the blue sector for its old economic paper roll.
Anku also shows in her sympathetic style how stockings can be used to carry a silk to which the right peaks grow.
Now the Easter grass is being grown, but let's do it in a little surprising way, Anku suggests and presents sawdust, stockings, and grass seeds from which she makes silk.
You can watch the videos from the bottom or Anku from the YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking your shirt and bit the adrenaline in Sotshi. Is he going to be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was shaking a little more than ten minutes after he was in front of the media.
A fine tour left Lewis Hamilton, the first star of Mercedes, and certainly was an important criticism even for the Finns who collected this season.
Nice turn.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the final round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking, Bottas figured it out.
I have been on the stake only once this year, in Austria (middle), so time has passed quite a while.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good tours again.
It's not easy to get past Sosh's track, so leave is especially important.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he's driving tomorrow's victory, or whether he's in front of the Jeesman of Hamilton approaching the World Trade Center.
My departure to the race is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the stake, Bottas fasted.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis's leader, Sebastian Vettilin, is pretty big and the difference between me and me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, But Bottas added.
Hamilton was truly happy about Bottaks' success after the drive, and the stable boss of Mercedes, Toto Wolff, too, was able to taste it.
Lewis had the intention of winning Valtter, but he couldn't pull a jaw.
Valtter knows he's got to rip everything himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline was bitten out of the ears, Wolff was glowing.
The question is whether or not the stable will give Bottaks and Hamilton time to do the right thing, Wolff replied to the fight.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteleinen Erno Kinnunen reached the Finnish Championship in Rally
The SM series on the race car rarely ended.
Never before have the brothers ended up being Finnish masters at the same time.
Now it was done in the final race around Turku and Salo by Eerik and Henrik St Petersburg, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Keteleläinen Erno Kinnunen ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final race sealed him with Finland's championship for two-wheeled cars from the SM4 category.
Kinnunen, which competes in Honda Civic, and the map reader Ville Mäkelä, started their part competition in Turku, because the starting points were clear: an investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the twin had to give a correction when some of the extra lights were deceived by another special test.
It could've been a pretty blind one, you know.
In a situation like this, it's not good for a bunch of sips.
On Saturday, only the second series was followed by Jussi Tepo, Kinnunen told us.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
My wife said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and that war against terrorists is, as she says, close by.
In his speech at the UN, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But the war that's been going on for seven years doesn't seem to be over.
There's over 360,000 people dead in the war.
On Friday, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel told us in Germany that a Syrian meeting was scheduled for October, involving him in addition to the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions Americans were watching the Supreme Court court-martial TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptionally large amount of people around the squares.
In the United States, at least 20 million people were assigned to the Supreme Court on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, was before the Senate Justice Committee telling his story.
According to the preliminary findings, the consultations were followed by six main channels (ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC) with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
Several millions more were followed in order to increase their online consultation.
NBC reported that livestrims were followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported having done their year's record with 8.2 million live deliverys.
CNN numbers rise by more than 10 million, according to which they are calculated via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital was also able to start 8.0 million.
Digital start-ups are the channel's own, TV viewer numbers come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are, in any case, dizzy.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers usually receive only sports games and great Oscars and Grammys, as well as random political events such as presidents' speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The American football league's NFL final match at the Super Bowl is a trip.
This year Super Bowl gathered some 103 million people to NBC by the side of the squares.
In the last year Trump's first speech to Congress, Nielsen reportedly regarded nearly 48 million people and civilised fairs of 30 million people.
It's a very important thing.
The appointment of Supreme Court judges in the United States is an extremely significant case, as posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scala died in early 2016 and Republicans managed to stop President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was the Republican president appointed by Ronald Reagan, but he was in a number of questions, so-called Va'an, whose voice could have settled the position of the 9th Court.
He was a advocate of abortion and sexual minorities' rights and, for example, solved in 2015 his vote that the same sexes were granted marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his heels.
His choice in the highest court may be to lock down the Conservative force for decades.
Children have the right to receive information to their parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see the health data of their children from Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's strange.
Of course, the situation of Kanta initially was even more worrying: the parents could not even see the health data or recipes of the minors.
A temporary correction was made in autumn 2016 for people under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be repaired, but it has been amazing for a long time.
Now the repair is promised - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the amendment of the legal basis should not have been more than a roll-out.
After that, the understanding of the painting is about pressing the button: when the spray is held, it will be opened.
I'm sure a child can show his parents his information if he's got a bank account or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds do they have?
The ID is paid, and you can't even get a 10-year-old name.
Therefore, undergraduate class data cannot be seen in practice by anyone other than asking them to be printed.
It is not about the right of parents or about the right of children.
It is extremely important for parents to be involved in the care of their children.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be ensured.
Even minors can have family situations where all things cannot be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, of which free care is deeply involved in human rights.
In the United States, the F.B.I. started to sue for harassment in Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating at least two charges of harassment made by women.
One of the women had previously been consulted by the Senate Committee on Justice this week.
Kavanaugh has contested the allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his study.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation should not take longer than one week.
According to Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation into a limited investigation, and it doesn't necessarily become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaan.
The interested exterminator continued to bullying even in kamar.
The police are telling me that he's put a man in a police detention facility and he's not in the mood.
The police were targeted at the suspect's threat on Saturday night in Kajaan.
Officials report a case that started when a decent 30-year-old man challenged a rough fight at the central restaurant.
First, the man abused another customer inside the nutrition movement.
This led to the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the killer attacked another man by pouring him down.
When a third party tried to skip, he still hit him.
The trial in the third grade led to a call from the police.
Partio grabbed a man and took him to the police station in Kajaan, the police are telling us.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the cops.
The police are telling us that they've sent a man into the police prison to calm down.
He's a suspect of three assaults and an official's violent opposition.
Grant organisations are preparing to start work at Sulawes in Indonesia - the most urgent water in the world -
The United Nations Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to assist in Indonesia's island of Sulawes, says Kirsi Haru, Finland's Information Manager, Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading rescues, but the need for additional assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicefi always has a full emergency response, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in ruins, both survivors and dead.
Please, in the city of Sulawes, rescue measures are underway, but the situation in the region of Donggala is a little further north.
Still there are places where the connections are not working.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings are often light structures in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter at first, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in times of crisis.
For the first time, people are usually able to supply water-cleaning tablets that are also stored in Unicef.
Water systems are to be repaired as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is transported, for example by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children will get rid of their parents.
Looking for family members and combining families is one of the roles of Unicef.
Food aid is another part of the UN World Food Programme (WFP).
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected are used for emergency aid.
However, for example, Unicef has already begun the fund-raising process to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
The billionaire Elon Musk will end as Chairman of Tesla's Board - 20 million dollars in tickets
The founder of space rockets and electric car manufacturing companies, Elon Musk, will avoid fraud charges in an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
The billionaire Elon Musk will end its duties as Chairman of Tesla's Board and agree to the fine of $20 million.
The bank will withdraw from this task as part of the agreement it entered into with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing with the Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Muski because of the twins he sent from securities fraud in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing for the withdrawal of Tesla from the stock market by the electric car company, which resulted in a rapid increase in the company's share rate.
According to the agreement, Musk must not chair the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new and independent member of its Board and will take over two independent directors of its Governing Board.
Tesla also needs to set up a committee to monitor Muski's communication.
Misk can still be CEO of Tesla.
In addition to the fines of 20 million dollars per person in Musk, Tesla will also have to pay a fine of 20 million equivalent to the financial supervisor.
The Twiits led the investors wrong
According to the SEC, Musk's twins led investors and Tesla's shareholders to abject.
Musk claimed that he would have ensured the financing by which Tesla would be bought back from the stock market to a private limited company.
According to the billionaire's swaps, the company would have been bought off the stock market at a share price of $420.
Tesla’s share price rose by more than ten per cent per day after the twins, but decreased later.
According to SEC, Muski's claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the financing he claimed.
Nor had he discussed the withdrawal of the stock market with the other board of directors or the board of the company.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14 per cent when the SEC of the SEC announced a fraud charge.
The new agreement is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The last sentence is not a reason
Of course, the clocks of the court court do not ring when the wise men do not move.
It's a technical error.
The clock of the tower of the Helsinki court has stopped.
The wisers show you at 12:00.
The situation is like a mediocrastination: even when the crypt of the church belongs to the exorcism and the urea fight themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has gone down.
There's been a repairer looking at it, but some part's gone down and a new part is expected, Sunliina Jamsen says.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by Kirkko Helsinki -Twitter account.
The account states that the last sentence is not the reason for stopping the watch.
Jamsen says the clocks of the church don't ring for error.
