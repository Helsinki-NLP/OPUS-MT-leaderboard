Changes to company support practices - Region - Regions - News - Karelian
In addition to EU business support, national business support management will be concentrated on four centres starting in mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the South Savo Ely Centre is responsible for its activities in Mikkel.
According to the new Enterprise Support Act, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Funds must no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is a whole new activity.
The subsidiaries of municipalities of more than five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be a great honor.
On the other hand, investments that improve local business conditions can continue to be supported by EU aid.
In Eastern Finland, approximately 30 people will be the strength of the EU and national support unit.
At least for the time being, they all continue to work at their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölöse, Head of the Structural Funds Unit of the South Savo Ely Centre, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine now.
Russia works consistently, even if it does not seem like it always does.
The head of the Department of Defence Strategy, Colonel Torsti Siren, was not surprised by the conflicting Ukrainian news of Monday morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its paratroopers are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhanski Airport, and that the tank department has received confirmations (read more here).
Mr Lavrov insisted that the Minsk negotiations give immediate cease-fire without conditions.
Russia denies being involved and immediately must have the outcome of the negotiations so that they can have their established position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole point of the story, Siren says.
This is the big picture: suddenly we need to start negotiating and specifically so that Russia gets its own grips in the areas of Luhanski and Donetsk.
Finnair externalises cabin services for Norwegian companies, holidaying people
Finnair begins to purchase passenger services under-contracted from an OSM Aviation service company in Norway.
The agreement concerns the first stage of Finnair Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but it is to be extended later.
The appearance of the two routes will result in a reduction of about 100 years of work in Finland, which will be carried out at first stage on holidays, the company reported when it informed.
In addition, the work of some 80 Asian temporary workers ceases at the time the routes are out.
Finnair has already told us in June that it intends to exit some 20 routes of passenger services over the next two years.
The exits were closed when no savings were achieved with the staff.
The exits are due to begin next year in January-March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also be continued with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nervous back pain, i.e. impact pain, for those who are working hard.
In the occupational health system, firemen were monitored for 13 years.
The connection between sleep disorders is surprisingly strong, even though many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and durability conditions of firemen, which are tested regularly, do not appear to protect from pain, says Sirpa Luisa, research director, in the information provided by the occupational health institution.
The work of firemen is an irregular turnout that can take up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health system, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you feel the new causes of water damage?
The damage to other dwellings is easily caused
Water damage Water damage is not always caused by leaking pipes or taps, reminds me of an expert in the host union.
We have been contacted when the infringement of the aquarium has caused water damage in the building company, whether it is possible to deny the aquarium, reports Marina Furuhjjem, a law expert in the host union.
Furhuhjelm reminds us that only pipes and drains are not common causes of water damage, but also more and more new machines, such as ice-cream machines, have caused floods in housing.
Many people do not know that machines such as washing machines or washing machines must not be left on.
Also, water should be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, because the pressure in the tube can lead to water leaks.
A resident may be regarded as insolvent in the event of a failure to fulfil those obligations, in which case the liability for damage shall be borne by the resident.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance may compensate for the damage, depending on the terms of the insurance and the case.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused loss of care, the person is liable.
If the resident has passed into the shower on the floor roof, neglect can often be proved because in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes to the apartment where the deceased can find it.
Furhuhjelm says that due to the general appearance of decomposition on the floors, two floors of the ground have been installed in the shower spaces in many student apartments today.
Water damage has also caused water beds, though not to the extent that they were more popular.
Even a dog’s water cup and a fall in its domestic wine can cause real water damage.
I also know the case where there were many cats in the apartment who had peed on the floor so that there was widespread damage, Furuhjelm says.
The principle of liability for repair always goes in the same way if the company’s company’s corporate order does not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and damage to the building structure and damage to other dwellings.
Water damage easily destroys other apartments because the concrete of the structure really absorbs water easily.
According to the Furuvolt, the pattern leaks in housing are particularly difficult because the batteries are easily leaking to mysterious structures.
Water damage can cause now increased air temperature pumps that produce condensed water.
Water should lead to a solid drain or a rainwater network, not just a container.
The shareholder also has the responsibility to remove the water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, and the lawyer advises.
Furuhjelm states that, although the rules of the building company do not require, for example, permanent removal of the washing machine, the insurance may be subject to a condition for which the compensation is not obtained for that reason.
You should be careful with your home insurance policy.
However, I consider the irradiated water discharge tubes of washing machines, for example, to be a major risk which has caused many damage.
I recommend that the exit doors are always firmly attached to the drain pipe.
The removal of snow and water by the balcony
Control of washing machines, washing machines, etc., while on top of them.
Dishwasher and dishwasher sealing
The cleaning of the ceiling well in visible parts twice a year.
It is recommended to connect the exit doors firmly to the drain.
Check the handles and their possible leaks
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experiences in the comment?
FC Honka disappeared again and poured into a serial god
At Tapiola Sports Park, two of the weakest teams at this moment met the football Hockey League gym on Sunday night.
In June, FC Honka, who celebrated the last victory, won the seven games in the victory of the football club of Vaasa.
VPS took his previous victory just in July against Honka.
The meeting of Sunday with the Espoola team became a good team, for VPS returned for a long time to the winning position by reading 2-1.
The Vaasai head coach Olli Huttunen complained before the game about the inefficiency of his team, but the mixed Honka defense made the VPS’s goal-making problems easier.
Playfully very nervous.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we couldn't hold the ball, Huttunen assessed the performance of his own.
During the first half of Honga's slippers, Milos Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played really uncertainly.
Both horizontal paints were created as a result of the discovery of the cupboards.
After only five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey directed Walter Viitala, a Honka painter who was evaporated by Sebastian Strandval's shot.
I'm sorry about the first half.
By field, the team was doing the opposite of agreed before the game, the Hongan head coach Shefki Kuqi took over.
After the initial shock, the Espoolans won their games together and rolled the ball at the head of the attack.
In particular, the middle field player Carlos Portela and the prodigy Roni Porokara were eager to pick up the scenes, but the last solutions were almost repeated.
The closest goal was the Honga Central Fieldman, Jussi Vasara, whose shot from 20 metres went a little past the VPS.
The VPS was effective in attacking its smart attackers and Honga's confused toppari.
At about half an hour, the Vaasa people made a 2-0-osuma when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through and through.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good game end during the opening period and created repeatedly on the left side situations.
Stewart's speed on the other hand seemed to be too much for the Espool defense throughout the game.
I heard in half time that if we lose, then we lose with honor, Kuqi told us.
In the second period, the entouraged Honka applied for a scalding painting.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third attempt was successful.
Yerai Vilabo, a stimulant, finished the paint in the middle of the penalty zone.
After Vilaboa's goal, Hongla had half an hour to balance the match.
The Espoo team has been taking more and more risks, which has enabled the VPS to engage in dangerous attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got along with Viitala once, but the twirling fights of the Honka painter kept the home team involved.
After the end, Honka did not get any further paints.
With the killing, Honka was the last one of the Veil League to have seven games left.
Journal: Putin threatened to seize Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite loud in the telephone discussion with the President of the EU Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian La Repubblica magazine.
Putin expressed its excitement about the European Union's plans to tighten up sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica says Putin's words.
According to the paper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: You should not irritate Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave the Russian television first channel an interview on the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
In an interview Putin told the Government of Ukraine to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the shooting of civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
You can't look next door to Russia if people get shot to death at close range, Putin said.
Esko Roine admits: The actor’s work destroyed the family
The hard work of the Concarinator and the theatre girl grew to recognize how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actor Esko Roine meets up next Friday for 70 years, but in his case, I think it's a valid saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to one year ago or two years or ten years ago.
The spirit puberty appears to continue, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but still she's got a lot of work to do for many men.
Sometimes there was a joke that there were not many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
Roine currently has the roles of playing the City Theatre in Helsinki How to succeed in business life, the Tampere Worker Theatre Mindmaker and the Tampere Comedy Theatre in Kvartet.
Roine will also be seen in the coming Risto Slayer movie.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
The acting career with the rooster didn't start promising.
I didn't fit a roadboy picture at school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't come down.
The choice of the career was clear, there were no options.
It felt close and loved.
I was so busy in the field that I left school and went volunteer in the army just to get to the theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatre roles and 300 TV shows a little depending on how to calculate.
If work is calculated like the Angelsmanns, that every part of the TV series is its own show, then TV stuff is over 600.
I mean, I was three years in a new day, three episodes a week.
The other spring I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
Eskon’s isoskes Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full strike and the Tampere Worker Theatre is still playing the wild roles as an anarchist drums.
Little brother's gonna be on stage for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
I always have to make a small reservation to come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
There are reservations in Calendar for autumn 2016.
The years have left a man's trail.
She's not coming alone.
The knees have been operated, the hips hate and the arthropod bothers, but when you don't let it bother you too much, you'll get out of these, Esko Roine says.
For the TV audience, Roine became familiar, among other things.
From the pirate radio, and from a glance where he shared hundreds with Antti Einio, a hundred mark notes.
It was Antti Einio, sharing crops.
I tried to make them rain and not crops.
The Reinikainen series, Roine, was a superfluous Lieutenant Rautakallio.
He became the favorite friend of the Tampere policemen, at the facility when he happened to be working on the same condition as the Commissioner.
One of the policemen stopped the car on the street, took the window open, and shouted to me, \"This Rautakallio is great.\"
Workgroup Successful
Some of the theatres have remained in the minds of Roe ande, for example.
The Producer and Master Class of the City Theatre of Helsinki, the death of the Tampere Worker Theatre Trade Traveler and the long night of the Tampere Theatre.
Everyone has to do with the fact that the performances have been popular.
It's not my fault. It's the task force's been successful.
There's been rimanites, too.
The film has one of those roles.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the outcome is not satisfactory to myself or to the viewers.
You don't get to choose your own work as a rival.
It's just nicely done what's been told.
In addition to the theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It didn't come at all when I tried to be the director, actor, and then a food maker of Tampere Theatre at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it turned out that they can't be reconciled in any way.
The typical thing was that when the show was finished or in the middle of the day and I thought about whether to put the sauna on, the restaurant became a call that you have friends here hoping to see you after the show.
Memoirs for Birthday
On the day of birth, memories of Esko Roine appear, dream writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
They've created some kind of nail from the face-maker's memories.
At Zoom's, at times, when I was playing, I was called a face-to-faceist.
That's not what I've known.
It's been written for years.
At times, Roine told me that there's no news bomb in her license, because she hasn't done anything so poor, or if she is, she won't tell me.
I made a small opening statement.
I say that if someone is waiting for scandalous divinations or good gossip, it is worth ending reading here.
A lot of time there is involved in the profession, as an actor as the director of the theatre.
According to the publisher, there is also a tour of a full-fledged theatre school.
It was a pretty normal student life, but it was a lot of fun to do all sorts of tricks.
It wasn't as loud as it was back in Turka's day.
It was very different.
I don't know how much of it I got but confidence that when the school was done so much, it's not gonna be closed if things don't get better.
I didn't have to think how good I'd be if I went to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I made friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Härinen and got to work with them.
After all, there were legends from my first father-in-law, Charles Halttu.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him during school.
The middle boy of the fire, Martti, was in the same class with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttusen.
As a pain, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were split up.
Not in two parts, but in such a way that my daughter went to my mother and son to me.
I did not consider it a good solution, and I believe that children are quite in agreement now as adults.
It's not uncommon for theatre circles to split silver.
In my case, someone was thinking that I did a lot of work back then.
I was in the theater almost every case.
And then there was TV and the radio on top of it.
I did a long day and had a family life.
Well, maybe on a day off, maybe, maybe at the party.
Esko Roine celebrates the Tampere Worker Theatre at the Mielsähtähtő on 7 September.
The party will continue at Helsinki City Theatre on 21st and 28th September.
And there, too, there's a pilgrim.
I worked for 50 years. I worked for 60 years.
When this is an easy - moving play, I thought we'd have seventies now, and we'd get them out of here with a single rhythm.
And according to Roe and I, we don't have any holidays on our birthday.
I think it's free night, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have been doing some work for that day.
Or maybe it's a strange night off, which I'm going to have tonight off, Roine says.
Aviation companies are concerned about the production chain
Some of the UK's smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may combat the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In Britain thousands of companies in the manufacturing chain of aircraft are currently enjoying an unexpected large number of simultaneously implemented aircraft and engine development plans.
Aviation and defence
While some enjoy order intake, warning has been given about capacity problems and price pressure at the hands of the production chain.
“It is quite true that price pressure exists, especially now that the production volume presents challenges, ” says Director-General of MB Aerospace, the major suppliers of aircraft engines such as Craig Gallagher, Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing some 240 aircraft suppliers in North England, more capacity is needed.
–Are strategies and investment plans responding to these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure about that.
Above all, we need more investment in the new production equipment and machinery needed to carry out these production volumes, says Gallagher.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft construction is part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, the CEO of JJ Chrurchilli, who produced gas turbine wings, has a great time behind it, while several new construction plans were implemented at the same time at the beginning of the year.
In the face of the moment, we moved from very low production to a state where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we also had to try to move forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans,\" says Churchill.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing GBP 800 000 in new machines and employing 26 new workers.
Several operators in the sector believe that there is a need for further coordination between investment and small suppliers if Britain wishes to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the United States.
Geoff Ford, the President of Ford Aerospace and the director of Tynesid's fine mechanical engineering, says that the order intake should increase the confidence of producers and desire to expand production capacity, as the work will be sufficient.
If this doesn't happen, we'll lose our competition against other countries, Ford will say.
A few large operators are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The FTSE 250 aircraft company Senior bought UPECA 75 million UPECA parts of the aircraft operating in Malaysia.
Last year MB Aerospace acquired companies from North America and Poland.
“It is possible to buy new activities for creative start-up companies, but in fact the most production is slowed down by the limitations of design and the number of engineers,” says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted from those large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some people believe that the problems of the production chain operators are being exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, director of the GKN aircraft manufacturing unit, also acting as a representative of the UK aviation industry, believes that the production chain has been better addressed than in previous periods.
There's pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
\"The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important,\" says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have taken the wrong steps to learn and are now more cautious in order not to increase the volume of buildings too quickly.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it faced major difficulties when the company lost its production and fought to survive the production chain.
Tony Wood, director of the Rolls Royce Aeroplane Production Unit, says that the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain, which provides most of the 18 000 parts needed for the manufacture of the jet engine.
“You will certainly be smothered, but we believe that we have done more thorough work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and by keeping in touch with suppliers when preparing them for more action, ” Wood says.
According to James McNerney, CEO of Boeing, the company’s production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly towards suppliers, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus’s Airbus’s passenger jet engine manufacturing unit, says that the company will do its utmost to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines per month by 2018.
Perhaps one of the suppliers is not successful, and our task is to try to prevent this situation and to support suppliers and look for alternatives, but there are great problems to be found,\" Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: \"The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is the work of me and Airbus.
Hong Kong protest teams are starting the era of \"national intolerance\" - in the ban on elections in Beijing
China refuses to give Hong Kong full democracy
Democratic activists are spreading to Hong Kong streets following China's rejection of their open elections.
The groups in favour of democracy in Hong Kong emphasise that demonstrations can be marked and sworn to ensure that the city begins the era of 'national non-violence' in order to resist the elections proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of protestors threatened the rainy horizon that would come into Hong Kong when they walked in front of the Council's law enforcement premises by the Occupy Central Group in support of democracy, where the protestors urged people to take part in a large-scale civilisation campaign in order to frame the city's financial quarter.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would prohibit the right of voters from proposing publicly in 2017 at the mayor's elections, thus threatening the monthly demonstrations that would further increase the city's dynasty.
The protestors will take part in the opening of the demonstration of the Occupy Central movement in front of the central government buildings in Hong Kong.
“We want fair and decent elections, ” says a 24-year-old website operator Dion Tse, who attended a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-yi.
The government doesn't respect Hong Kong's voice.
We want the government to listen to us and see Hong Kong's determination.
China's highest lawmaking body, the People's Congress of China approved plans for election changes, with which only two three candidates can participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the proposal requires the approval of the 1200-synchronisation Committee, and the opposition politicians believe that this will effectively prevent the presence of a different political perspective on electoral flags.
In the context of the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, the demonstrations were carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government Building.
Police estimates that more than 2 600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when some 100 protestors led by Scholarism study group were gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where a member of the Communist Party Li Fein was expected to stay after his arrival in Beijing.
Benny Tai, a founder of Occupy Central, participated in a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholalarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, he did not say the exact date when the roads were blocked, but urged the participants to closely monitor the development of the situation during the next couple of weeks, while adding that the city is officially moving to the era of civil disobedience.
Benny or he'll answer the press questions.
\"Look at the person next to you,\" he said, in his Sunday demonstration, two of them in China were standing in front of a billboard representing a character of disobedience.
That man will rule with you!
The 17-year-old collections of Scholarismia Joshua Wong said earlier that the preparations for high school students’ demonstrations are ongoing and are designed to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to demonstrate their minds by refusing to teach.
\"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility,\" says Wong.
In Beijing, Deputy Secretary General Li Fei of the People's Congress Committee told the journalists that the defence of the universal right-to-people requirements is a waste of time, starting with some Hong Kong politicians seeking to confuse and mislead society.
“The unorthodox proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time, ” Li says, demanding that the electoral method should be created in such a way that it fits the real situation and the legal framework of each society.
The General Voting Act can only be adopted if a large majority, i.e. two thirds of the 70-person legislative body in Hong Kong, supports it, which means that 27 opposition members of the Government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might have to have a long-term political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto law.
It would harm business and city development, he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal questionnaire organised by the Occupy Central Movement in June in response to China's demands, and the candidate needs a committee approval.
Even the 172 000 people march on behalf of democracy on 1 July, while the march organised on 17 August in support of Beijing and opposed the Occupy Central movement attracted some 88 000 participants. The figures come from Hong Kong University, although the police and organisers' estimates differ significantly from these figures.
Three injured lightning attacks on the New York bathing area
In a lightning strike on a New York beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, the men were injured on the Orchard Beach Coast in Pelham Bay on Sunday night when the storms crossed the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning struck when the thunderstorms wiped out over the city.
Storm rains, thunder and lightning interrupted the Labor Day weekend celebration and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
Tens of the commercial flights arriving at the city airports were late due to bad weather.
The new idea is not to please
This is the latest instructions from network users to employees and supervisors, and is distributed by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager site.
According to an entrepreneur Seth Godin, it's a good idea to identify comments like, \"I don't like it,\" or \"I don't understand.\"
Unless this is the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – that is, boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so little that it is not worth pursuing.
As a historian, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as head of the university, he repeats the same thing several times so that the message would come across widely.
According to Adviser Bob Hoffman, TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates a supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news about the network does not mean that the internet is good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular means of communication but a bad option for advertisers.
The psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson states that there is one word to motivate workers: together.
In a study, participants were told that they would resolve the problem of cooperation, even though they actually worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not informed of cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a repeat pattern or relationship between two units, the event expert Dave Paradi will advise you to forget Microsoft SmartArt and instead use a Diagrammer.com program where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Casual surgery in Mount Stuart Hospital banning due to safety risk
The specialist has been temporarily expelled from office, and NHS in the UK's national health system ceased to direct patients to a hive operation in that private hospital after the hospital's problems came up.
Two people applied to Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon said that he was in contact with 19 patients who had been treated on 26 July and invited them to a clinical trial in a high degree.
Mount Stuart's hospital was apologizing, and he said that it had been investigated after the doctor's divorce.
The case came to the hospital in Torbay when two patients in Mount Stuart applied for its first aid due to eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all studied on the same day had to have had surgery.
The Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital have not directed patients to treatment since the occurrence of the problems with Mount Stuart.
The temporary director of the South Devon Healthcare Foundation (NHS Foundation) at Torbay Hospital, David Sinclair, said: “We have identified the problem in its early stages and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Every time we direct patients to the service provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider complies with the latest legal requirements and that its authorisation matters are in order.
According to Gill Gant, the patient safety director of South Devon and Torbay Hospital, who is responsible for patient safety, is always at an absolute level, so it is important that these hives are not performed until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe,
Ramsay Health Care UK, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, has asked for “unfortunately forgive all patients who have been experiencing complications. ”
The company was reported to have called all the patients involved since we knew about the potential problem, from us and later from Torbay Hospital.
This specialist has been authorised by Ramsay Health Care since 2005, and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4 537 ocular surgery in various parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he performed have been excellent, and the percentage of complications has been below 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor was temporarily suspended until the matter was examined.
What's \"4chan-\"
The Pahamaine anonymic communication site was first published by celebrities' leaked naked images
What exactly is “4chan”, and why was it the hacker’s first option in his publication of stolen images?
\"4chan\" was established in 2003.
The site is divided into several parts, i.e. communication tables where anonymous users can discuss anything about video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other web forums, users do not create a similar, constantly used profile and their publications are not kept.
On the most popular notice tables comments may disappear below a minute when the latest publications remove them from the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchy and surprising creative atmosphere.
Members of anonymised community have created some of the most well-known measures of the network (such as \"rickrolling\" and \"solcats\"), but the lack of rules on the site has also resulted in a lot of questionable or directly criminal content on the site.
The most popular information sheet on the site is /b/, which is intended for semantic discussions and is regularly published in NSFW (Not Safe For Work).
This may include tame porn, but also raw and shocking images. An anonymous hacker published the stolen images of posters specifically on this notice board during the weekend.
American CytRx invests in cancer medicine research and development
The aim of the CytRx company is to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company producing biological medicinal products in Los Angeles, which became the target of an action for the effective sale of shares a short while ago, is specialised in the research and development of anticancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is aldosorubic, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx will conduct clinical studies in aldosterone with soft tissue sarcoma, AIDS associated capos sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It's as if it's a guided missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to any other body, says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
My Aldocsorubisis contains so-called unit technology, which works like a Troiyan horse.
It binds directly to the protein in the blood, which also collects into the tumours, so that it passes directly into the cancer cells.
The drug is given only by a acidic environment, i.e. in cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to receive more and more doses of anticancer medicine.
“It is like a missile that passes directly into the tumor and not into any other body, ” says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on the development of medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus collected $86 million for maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide in a crucial phase 3 clinical trial for alternative treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissue.
Alternative therapy is used to treat cancer when the initial treatment does not lead to results.
If a clinical study is successful, CytRx is planning to apply for a prescription for the management of US food and medicines already in 2016, Kriegsman says.
The medicinal product could then be approved in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published by CytRx from a previous clinical study in December showed that aldosorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
\"We haven't seen any clinical information about how much it's different from the drug itself,\" says H. C. Wainwright & Co. investment firm analyst Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
Fein says, however, that it is difficult to predict the results and timing of the current clinical study, because it differs significantly from the previous study that produced good results.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Fein's comparing drug development to the mining industry.
The first is to invest a lot of money in finding one of the gold salts, and the investment is going to take so long to find that golden swamp, he says.
The money is spent on research and development for so long as the medicine can be commercialized.
Several shareholders have called for the CytRx company to be courted because they believe it gave a better picture of its success.
It is accused of hiring DreamTeam Group, which, according to its claims, hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and the second biotechnology company, Forbes, Seeing Alpha, Motley Foolin and Wall Street Cheat Sheet, in the articles published on pages such as Forbes, Seeing Alpha, Motley Foolin and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaint, the articles did not show that the companies paid the fees to the writers.
As a result of the news, Seeing Alpha announced that he had removed the articles that were against practice.
Other websites also removed many articles about companies.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the accusations.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to answer the complaints.
I don't have time or energy to concentrate on this, says Kriegsman.
According to him, the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to employ centres of biotechnology such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
This is in many respects from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry, he says.
View of the Analyst newspaper
The price of the shares in the CytRx company rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than $3 in April when the charges for the advertising of shares came to the public.
According to the Analyst magazine, the complaints and negative disclosures have decreased the price of the shares below their real value.
\"It's unfortunate,\" Fein says, \"but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to ignore this thing as long as the idea is valid\"
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of the photos.
In the name of the Law series, which is based on true events in Finland, the photographer died Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident.
The cameraman took pictures of the armed robbery between a local police department and a fast-food restaurant in the middle of the shooting of a suspect when he got hit by bullets.
He died of trauma quickly.
According to theTMZ website, the police reported that in the shooting incident the suspect died in addition to the cameraman's.
The first series of true TV programmes in the name of the Law has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an outsider will rise to a crucial role in the court justice process which started today.
Anneli Auer is accused of the murder of her husband, Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
For the second time, the Court of Justice of Vaasa has dealt with the case, since the Supreme Court has restored it to law as a result of the new evidence.
The purpose of this court is to give judgment on this year's day.
In 2011, Vaasa’s Court of Justice released Auer.
At that time, the right considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening address, D.A. Kalle Kulmala, D.A., reported the state's view of the murder night and of the factors that remove the possibility of an outsider.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether an outside factor has come into the house who has killed Jukka Lahden Anneli Auer in a way and in time.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report, the Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the family dispute had begun, during which Auer had declared that he was leaving home and seeking divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where Lahti was holding onto Auer and trying to stop it from leaving.
One of them took the kitchen knife, Kulmala described the events of the night of the death on Monday.
According to the D.A., several evidences prove that there was no external agent present.
For example, emergency telephone calls do not involve soundings from an outside factor.
The oldest child of Auer's, his daughter, in questioning, told me that he saw the author when he left the back room door.
The release judgment of Vaasa Court in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the D.A., the daughter's observation cannot be correct.
\"The daughter didn't see an outsider in her parents' bedroom, even though she went there twice to watch,\" Kulmala said.
The new witness to the prosecution is about the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has been telling me about what happened since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to a woman, the only thing she told her daughter at the hospital was that she saw only Lahti's body when she was at the scene of the murder in the fireplace.
Auer's defense intends to introduce legal investigation lines whose contribution, according to the defense, has not been sufficiently clarified by the police.
Three years ago, when Vaasa’s court released Auer’s accusation, the court held that the foreign man’s dna was one of the outsiders who had been found cheaply.
The sample later turned out to be the dna of a scientist working in the Central Crime Police Laboratory.
A sample of DNA was taken from 700 persons at mass.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded, the defense attorney Juha Manner said.
Another of the new defense witnesses reports about a possible outsider.
The Uvilian woman told the police about a porous man who, according to what she told me, had confessed to the act.
The police questioned him during the summer.
The D.A. made a decision that a porous man had nothing to do with a homicide.
A woman's prosecutor made a request for an investigation because the prosecutor suspects a woman's lie in her report.
Another of the new Witnesses in defense is a nurse who worked at the central hospital in Satakunta at the night of death.
The Supreme Court of the Land condemned the murder of Auer's life-long imprisonment in December last year.
According to the judgment of the District Court, the outsider’s ability to fight against, among other things, the reports of the Auer children, the absence of the external factor in the emergency record, as well as the time required by the course of the events.
The judgment came with a sound of two to one.
A minority judge wrote that evidence in criminal matters must be interpreted as in the interest of the accused.
That is why the daughter's report must be interpreted as saying that, despite the contradictions in the report, this had found an outsider leaving the back room door.
Two of the oldest children in Auer's family have been invited to the court hearing.
For the first time in person last year, she was heard in the midst of the Supreme Court of Satan.
He never remembered the events of the night of the murder.
The second oldest child in Auer was named the killer of her mother in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the murder-night events behind a closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
The boy has no obligation as a lawyer to say anything in a court of law.
The court proceedings will continue today with the consultation of Anneli Auer.
If necessary, we'll continue hearing the Auer tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently in prison for more than seven years of sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to participate in the G20?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him the number one male.
Putin is to take part in the G20 summit in Brisbane in November and Australia is very much to discuss whether or not it should be allowed to enter.
In the weekend, Pussy Riot called on Australia to ban Putin's participation in a summit involving over 4 000 representatives of the world's most powerful countries.
“This person, we believe, has nothing to do with the G20, ” said Maria Alyokhina to the audience at a full-fledged opera house in Sydney in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned us that he is on the ‘full war’, and Putin calls parts of Ukraine ‘Novorossia’, or ‘new Russia’, so we need to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said, \"He's about to make a decision,\"
According to the director of the G20 unit of the Lowy Institute Research Centre, Mike Callaghan, Australians cannot decide who to attend the meeting, even if there is a meeting in the country.
It's an international meeting, he says.
Just as in New York's host of UN meetings or Washington's host of International Monetary Fund meetings, it is not for the father to deny someone to be invited, Callaghan says.
In the last week, Tony Abbott said that he was going to push the decision, following Russian detestable actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia does not have the right to decide on it alone.
\"But this is an important issue that I am going to weigh a lot, and I think that is what other countries will do in the coming weeks,\" she says.
People attend the anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, East Ukraine.
The event takes two days to participate in a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest emerging economies, where around two-thirds of the world's population live and account for 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as some of the guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was asked to balance the various interests under high public pressure.
He felt that the best way to deal with this is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
\"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions,
If Putin comes to the meeting, it's his duty to give him an explanation of what he's doing, Callaghan says.
There is a clear increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world is waiting for them to bring these things up.
Russian rebels are preparing weapons for the attack on the bases of the Ukrainian army at Donetsk Airport in Eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether to attend Puti's meeting and, according to Callaghan, this is not necessarily known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly states that \"I need to change my attitude towards Ukraine, because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November,\"
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, takes Putin's income to Australia with great reservations, but he understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other States and G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international, not an Australian conference, and I understand that.
After the tragic events following the Malaysian Airlines crisis, and in the absence of proper cooperation in terms of pity, sense of responsibility and safety, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are on the border with Ukraine, I think that most Australians are very prepared to welcome Putin to Australia.
Germany’s business world criticises some of the most licensors in Berlin.
Some of the German top business leaders warn that Germany has become an over-trustive and dynamism because government policy is threatening the competitiveness of the country's hardship.
The criticism against the Government of the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel happens at the same time as the largest European economy shows signs of slowing down, causing concerns as to whether it will be able to run economic growth in a fully-fledged euro area.
The criticism of business leaders is the result of the fierce opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wage and the calculation of the retirement age of certain long-term employees to 63 years.
\"I think that the biggest threat right now is too much confidence in Germany, which will inevitably lead to a sense of self-resilience,\" says Kurt Bock, CEO of the world's largest chemical manufacturer in the world.
EU economy
He said: “In general, it is a feeling that we are doing well, we have money to use and unemployment at relatively low levels.
I think there's a great danger here.
The German Government policy shows that we do not focus on growth and are not a favourable environment for companies, but rather we focus much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain entities.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of BDI, the German Industry Organisation, the situation in Germany is now good.
However, in the next ten years, every developed economy must change. ... [Germany] reform programme will not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, even a slowdown in consumption.
However, the fall in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of the exportable Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2% over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation more difficult and may make it more likely to resumption on a quantitative basis.
Mr Kerber would like to see government spending transferred back to public investment, for example by focusing future consumption on infrastructure rather than on pensions.
Kerber believes that the Merkel Government will destroy the fruit of his social-democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder at the beginning of the 21st century by a strict policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation for Family Enterprises, Germany’s situation remains good compared to other countries.
It is a thank you to businesses and not so much to government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of neighbouring France has shown that spending money on social aid and restricting the freedom to run a business is a wrong way of doing so.
The leading German investment bank described the situation more directly, saying that recent decisions by the government are \"a disaster\".
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has done so much work for, just to please the voters.
This is my main concern at the moment, the banker says.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to solve the fundamental weaknesses of the policy that have caused the industry to face competitive costs.
Ashton Kutcher handshake at the music festival, unhindered access to the fan by security officers.
The actor Ashton Kutcher participated in the Stagecoach-kantrimic festival in Indio, California, where he was reported to have a run-in fight with a tight guard.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to have a run-in fight with a security guard at the country music festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at the backstage at the Stagecoach-Catriot Festival in California, after which the situation came out of hand, theTMZ site tells.
Kutcher was in the VIP room when a young woman approached him to say hello and give him a hand.
When the male star of the series went to say hello to the fans, an over-intelligent security guard went in and caused the wand.
The actor and the security guard ran into a handshake, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to arrest Kutcher, TMZ says.
After breaking up with his ex-wife, Demi Moore, Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is the star of the former '70s show.
The doll happened shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically been removed from the standard cast of the hit series after he published a video in which he calls the series a \"rouse\" and urges fans not to look at it.
The actor Ashton Kutcher participates in the Stage Coach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, Jake, calls the show \"roast\" and urges people not to look.
The Baltic bacteria killed a vacationer
Six people have been affected by bacteria from the Caribbean, a popular German tourist destination.
One of the sick guys is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is met in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, but it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria is most effective in spreading over 20 degrees in burglary.
- Any kind of bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct, Dr. Heiko Will told The Local.
The bacteria can be found in one way in Denmark, Poland and along the coast of Germany.
According to LAGuS, the sick person had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
She passed away at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his legs should be shot.
He went swimming near Ahrensopy with a little wound on his leg.
He went to the hospital after he noticed on his way home that his leg had become blue.
Doctors observed blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus in the leg.
I'm sure my husband wouldn't have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he knew about the danger, the sick wife Sonja Bruehl told Oscee Zeitung.
A serious illness and the damage caused to the patient and his family could have been avoided if the data had been better available, for example, the holiday destination could have been made available to the public.
The LAGuS told the Dpa news office that the doctors were invited to have the next infection at the beginning of the summer, but no official notice was given.
Cool temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
“The results of the [Maantain] test showed that the strain of V. vulnificus has decreased significantly, ” says Dr. Will.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a family of cholera-induced bacteria, is especially dangerous if a person has pre-existing chronic liver disease and impaired immune response such as HIV or diabetes and elderly people.
Men's risk of having a disease is greater than women, as estrogen has been identified as a protective pathogen.
If the bacteria gets sick, it causes blood poisoning and septicism.
The probability of loss of bacteria is about 25 per cent when the bacteria gets into the wound.
According to Dr. Will, this is not an infectious event in these cases, the V. vulnificus can also be affected by eating marine animals contaminated by it.
Food from the sea is more frequent in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, the V. vulnificus bacteria caused poisoning the last time in 2010, when two people died of it.
Vieno Kekkonen: The breast was removed due to cancer
A 80-year-old singer, Vieno Kekkonen, is playing and exercising hard, but he has also had to be afraid for his health.
I can't believe Vieno Kekkonen, who's been ravaging for 80 years.
He himself is amazed at how many years of age can suddenly be so much.
I haven't quite realized I'm this old.
For 80 years, that sounds like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday Vieno Kekkonen is spending time with his family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was held for him by the folk music and retirement association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage in Kekkola, where my grandfather was born.
I was so embarrassed about the celebration, the birthday boy tells me about the occasion where the three hundred-dollar stage was full of congratulations.
A few days later, Muhotus gathered to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers having been with him as a young man.
And now we're both of our age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are only a few aspects that have not been seen in public in Vieno Kekko.
One thing he has never said before: in 2006 another breast was removed from him.
At a point where my breast was unclear, it was decided to be completely removed.
It was not cancer at last, of course, where I was happy.
A new breast was created during the same surgery, so it was a pretty big procedure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought that he has lost his own breast in a way that is in vain, for the knowledge of the unclear finding would have been difficult to bear and cannot be ignored.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen says and points out that the loss of his own breast is certainly more difficult for younger people.

The farmer is made guilty of seafaring
The debate on the poor condition of the Baltic Sea and its link with Finnish agriculture is depressive.
The voices of experts have been drowned in political-oriented opinions.
In particular, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have taken up agricultural responsibility for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea during the summer.
Fast action has been required to control emissions.
The average farmer affects some of his environmental researchers and helps the suppliers who are familiar with the matter compared to the over-representative nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that there can't be a cultivation if the field is sown with the same amount of nutrients as it is harvested with crops.
Almost all farms in Finland are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires close monitoring and reporting on nutrient content.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
The nutrients stored in the field have been flushed into the waterfalls even after the discharge restrictions, but there have been a clear reduction in emissions for many years.
Farmers are willing and ready to continue to work to reduce their nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to zero is impossible.
“If we want to have about the same amount of agricultural production as consumption, it is only acceptable that this is the case – says Jyrki Akkula, Director of the Environmental Research of MTT (MT 29.8).
During the summer, the Finnish Gulf received large blue crowds.
The researchers agreed that the levi received its growth power from the sea’s own phosphorus stocks.
Phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is, in part, a potato from the past decades of the coastal states, but it does not explain the stocks alone.
The treatment of waste water from the growing cities of the Baltic Sea was on the troll until the end of the 20th century.
The problem was also about large-scale waste water and was not seen as a problem as a problem as regards the pollution of our own beaches.
The pollution of shores was prevented by building a waste water pipe on the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of water directed there has improved over the years.
The nutrients that have come to an end in the sea will not be removed, even if the agricultural sector is completely removed from Finland.
Yet every summer's blue debate and the accusations put forward are always directed at agriculture today.
The public debate identifies the farmer as responsible for the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The prosecution is disproportionate, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to achieve political passions.
Greens are driving their presidents, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö, under the leadership of the Niinistö, with major changes to agricultural environmental standards.
As a billboard, Niinistö has been using the summer’s rest discussion.
As far as I'm concerned, the sonars have accused producers of MKK of old-fashionedness and have seen it as the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be some limit on political rhetoric.
Most of the specific water protection projects are based on cooperation between the OCTs, farmers and environmental management.
The Niinistö’s attacking style serves more fishing for city green sounds than water protection.
I think that's what you're talking about.
With tough speeches, the greens are preparing to leave the government behind.
In policy changes, it is the task of the OCT to ensure the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes to farmers unless they find a replacement for their costs.
The only money Ville Niinistö has put forward is cuts from other agricultural funds.
The annulment of the mine tax does not go through: Palmer
The latest attempt by the Abbott government to throw the mining tax into the trash basket seems doomed because Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any change.
The Australian Labour Party is also afraid that the government has introduced a new regulation to limit employers' additions to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in Parliament's lower room on Monday in order to speed up the process of annulment in the face of public confusion and a clear nervousness of the Labour Party.
It set aside the original motion for annulment, which had previously been subject to significant changes by the Senate, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described, first and foremost, relating to taxes, pensions, social security and social assistance for families.
In the first place, this was an initiative aimed at abrogating the 'unfortunated' tax on mining and other decisions, such as a low-income pension fee (EUR 3.6 billion), a bonus on earnings (1.3 billion) and a bonus on school-age children (EUR 4.7 billion).
Clive Palmer, Head of the Palmer United Party (PUP) did not accept the transfer of the government.
The initiative for annulment of the mine tax is not accepted in the Senate without a low income pension fee, a bonus for earnings and a bonus for school-age children.
The government needs support from independent parties such as PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Mr Chris Bowe, Minister of Finance, accused the government of trying to eliminate Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory amount of pension payments, giving the Minister of Finance every decision.
This is unheard of, he said to the reporters in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay other additions, which would allow the Labour Party to move up to 2034 to the 12% target of the pension guarantee.
\"It is not acceptable in any way,\" says Bowen, of course, the Labour Party.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop the forthcoming additionalities.
The man's body was found on Brighton's beach.
Sussex police picked up an unidentified man's body before two o'clock in the afternoon, and the police shut down an area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tour.
The police and the D.A. are working to find out the conditions under which the body went to the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers are going through the list of missing persons to find out if missing persons are connected to the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, with an accidental explosion at the border, there's a death victim.
According to the Piedras Negras police, the explosion in the customs building at the border between Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas acts as operational director of the local police at the Texas border.
He told Associated Press news that a woman who died in a Sunday explosion had skull damage and five others had burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred this morning in the night stays of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion has arisen from the accumulation of gases.
The explosion didn't affect border security.
Three Atlantic City casinos will close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
The male customer plays in the Showboat casino, which is supposed to close his door, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
In September, we're expecting a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table.
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City in the New Jersey state, which means that this neolighted subway, known as a cash machine, is no longer able to count the payouts.
More than 5,000 employees are unemployed in closing up the Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press news firm.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza will turn off its lights.
The expected closure of the three casinos, one of which had only been operational for two years, is the city’s last disaster at the Atlantic Club Centre’s end only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, the New York Times will write.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, suffering from a bad economy, the AP news office writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained much more competitors as casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania read a large part of Atlantic City’s once-in-a-wide casino connections.
Even before the gambling campaign, the Massachusetts is looking at its share of the amount of money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule is difficult to accept
According to the Power of Industry (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by the plant supplier Areva that the Volkiluodon trios reactor will not be commercially available until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, the head of the plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction works are already largely ready and the number of works in progress is known.
TVO will continue to assess the information received from Areva.
Silvennoinen states that TVO welcomes all initiatives to accelerate the project.
Today, Areva provided TVO with an updated schedule of 3 Olkiluoto, according to which the construction works of the three-step reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activities could begin in 2018.
According to the Reva report, the recent delays in the project have largely been due to the approval of the reactor automation systems that were received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with the TVO.
The number 3 had to start in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed once and for all.
For years TVO and Areva have been arguing about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is raised in an arbitration court, in which Areva has called for compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva's requirements unwarranted and requires about €1.8 billion from the company.
Energy and water cooperation is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in the context of the 24th International Water Week in Stockholm, and they urged energy and water actors to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time, to ensure sufficient water and energy production for the growing population.
Energy and water are the theme of the 2014 Water Week.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will immediately affect another.
These two funds are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
In the opening of the water week, Torgny Holmgren, the Executive Director of the Stockholm International Water Institute of Water Week, said that the challenges are huge.
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 50, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore closer cooperation between energy and water actors is urgently needed to find solutions to enable all the peoples of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, who received this year's water prize, described the water as a means of growth, which both society as a whole and other sectors need. Briscoe said that \"the developing countries face great challenges.
They need to mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that \"[the water crisis] does not have a permanent solution anywhere\"
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form the ring.
During the week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water actors during more than one hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Professor John Briscoe, originally from South Africa, will receive the Stockholm Water Prize His Majesty, King Charles XVI of Sweden, at the ceremony in Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
Stockholm's International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that provides research information and information to decision makers so that they can make decisions that are reasonable for water and sustainable development.
Flying home to the dead foreign bodies in Miami: Body flying costs
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees landed in Miami, and 14 were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of times before, and I'm sure this was not the last of its quality.
Every year more than 1,000 migrants die trying illegally to cross the United States border.
Because of the first city, they're ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that when you reach the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until your last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either a refuge, an effort board upwards, or a place of entertainment to wait for a better opportunity.
Few people imagine they die there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
In popular cities, the disproportionate amount of people born abroad and temporarily resident in the country continues to work.
It is estimated that 20% of the dead in South Florida will be flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, short form of professional slang, human remains) are flown to the country from Miami International Airport.
From 1964 onwards, according to Pierson, the largest company in the industry, the CEO, about 80% of this traffic travels abroad.

The more migrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, there's a homecoming.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures in the table describe the airline's human remains that were flown back to its home country in 2013.
Returning bodies to the country is not cheap: prices can vary from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
The religious, cultural and health requirements related to the flight and delivery of human waste also vary.
The colonial communities of the most favoured cities sometimes organise funeral communities to help the cost, because the return of the bodies is expensive, the government does not help the process and the dead are often young people who do not have insurance.
A number of credit institutions and informal health insurance programmes have been born from such entities as were established by Italian, Jewish and Greek - the first colonial groups in the United States in New York.
The new generations of Mexicans, the Chinese, the Philippines and the Bangladeshn migrants now work in the same number of their favored cities.

Death abroad is always a challenge, for few who move abroad are planning to make their last resorts out of the migrant city.
In Dubai, for example, without a will for foreigners who are dead, the Sharia Act is observed, even though the law on the possession of a dead country is different.
The whole property of the deceased shall be frozen and subsequently distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Aer Lingus, a network of Aer Lingus, as its headquarters (
2013) the size reflects the cultural structure of the city and the Irish people.
The airline interrupted the service, but resumed it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from those who moved from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present when man passes through or through the favored city of the migrants.
On the contrary – temporary or permanent migration to the migrant city is an open declaration of the migrant’s way of looking at life, not death.
Death abroad, however, means making the most powerful and irrevocable decisions for the migrants – whether they want to belong to a local or global community, to the universe or to the earth, to a short period of time or forever.
The Centre and the Association of Left ask for gender equality
The opposition parties from the centre and the left are going to ask the government an interim question on the income of low-income people and the increase in inequalities.
The parties want to raise the debate on the problems of people's livelihoods, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
Increasing inequalities are also reflected between the different parts of the country and within the large cities, the parties observe when they report.
In the next year's budget, cuts and increases in taxes are, according to the parties, directed at low incomes, such as students, unemployed and retired people, family and normal employment, while, among other things, food, medicine and housing are still increasing.
In fact, almost half a million people have already been unemployed, the parties say when they report.
The problems of living in the workplace have also been aggravated.
On Thursday, the central and left-wing parliamentary groups will address this issue.
The third opposition party, the basic Finns, has already announced that they have an interim question of the resources of police and internal security.
The parliamentary session will begin on Tuesday.
The New York City West Indian Day parade is about to begin.
The Caribbean culture is once again entering the New York City Lighting, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there are also politicians who see and see each other.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It takes notice of the traditional Carnivals before the Passover, and some of them are dancers carrying complicated, often made of feathers.
Eric Adams, President of the Brooklyn region, is the festival champion for this year, but there are also many other known faces to be expected.
Paraati is a great opportunity for politicians now and for candidates to say hello to the public a week before the elections.
Despite the celebrations, violence has been a part of the past years.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe through additional measures, e.g. by monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Is it worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows the rhetorical questions, doesn't it?
That question should not be answered.
This figure of language, i.e. a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests that in the direction of a particular answer, tastes both high-flight speeches and more everyday words.
The first words of the prosecution of Cicero's famous Catilina are chain rhetorical questions, the first of which is, how long, O Catilina, you're going to take advantage of our patience.
The same applies to my wife's questions: \"Why shouldn't I warm up five days of old chicken for children?\"
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a more fine word for a rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the open question, and the public is encouraged to accept the question.
A secretive rhetorical question suggests that no one with full understanding could agree on that.
David Williams, author of the 19th century book of material writing, described the retort as a reference to words that are admirably designed to make a strong sense of the truth of a subject, and at the same time, the challenge they are facing is impossible to disagree with.
The Skilling Skills
Retortic questions can be asked after all if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several rhetorical issues that have been raised after the end, designed to express grief or anxiety, are called epilepsy.
Job, for example, uses them to draw to the Almighty: “What good is it that you do me down?
Do you have eyes like us?
Do you see the way a person sees you?
The chains of rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife's comments: \"Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do anything right?
Furthermore, there is also a so-called hypofora, which is about when you ask the question and you answer it yourself immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: “Who is the black private egg that is a sexual fear for all women?
Parru!
You're right, you're right.
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: \"What is the only food the children have eaten and from which they may have been hurt?\"
This chicken.
Who fed it to them?
You.
Strangely, the rhetorical question does not usually tend to bend, even though rhetoric means bending skills.
If you are trying to talk to someone around, instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted, or to become discouraged by someone's stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions with restraint.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than trying to obtain one's own opinion.
If the public agrees with the claim that it is not nice to have the sun outside, the rhetorical question is that the speaker is sure of what binds the speaker and the public more together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is certain that there are no differing opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached, instead of reaching consensus, the speaker can be influenced, well, by self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weakness of argumentation.
In the headlines of the pages, the rhetorical question is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: \"Does the use of pyramids of alien beings\"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to an answer which differs from the one suggested.
“Are you thinking of the same thing as us? The British Conservative Party was at risk of a campaign clause in general elections in 2005.
Party's gone.
For some of these cases, there has become a hobby, and so-called QtWAIN questions (the concept of British journalist John Rentoul known as Questions To What Answer Is No, questions whose answer is not) are popular.
A few years ago, one of my friends organized a competition looking for the best examples.
The competition clearly won the song Do You Wanna Be In My Gang, which was sang by the pop star Gary Glitter before he became a child's sexual abuser.
The author also wrote the book ‘You Talkin' to Me’
Researcher: The time of the federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict many countries thought that the federal state could be some kind of compromise in the conflict, says Saari.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier said in an interview with the Russian channel that bringing peace to eastern Ukraine requires discussions on the status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
According to the Putin, it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
According to Saare, the transformation of Ukraine into a federal state is, in a certain way, a priority for Russia's goals.
Ukraine is certainly, for all reason, doubting that Russia would seek, through it, to influence the internal policy of Ukraine, he says.
If the federal solution is not reached, the second option could be some kind of frozen conflict from the Russian perspective, in which Russia would practically control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari estimated.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has challenged the arguments, even if, for example, the rebels of Russia themselves have told themselves that their troops have fought for volunteers, volunteers, Russian soldiers,
Up's Director: The powerful task envisaged for Katainen
Tilikainen reminds me that the job description is new and still emerging.
In his view, it is the idea that Katainen would, in some way, coordinate or even lead to the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the priorities of the Commission's new programme for the period is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is what is at the heart of the Commission's power, Tiilikainen says.
Tilikainen believes that the background, economic knowledge and role of Katais during the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be indelibly, i.e. Katais would not have his own DG under his control.
On the other hand, Katainen should be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment sectors, which would allow him to have portfolios in addition to the economic Commissioner's portfolio in order to coordinate other portfolios in the sector.
In practice, running a team could mean, for example, planning and guidance.
Mothers of soldiers: up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organisation, in the past two months, up to 15 000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine, and there are currently over 7 000 Russian soldiers.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the city hospital in Rostov near the border of Ukraine is currently wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of soldiers collect their data from the soldiers' families.
The Military League of NATO has estimated that there are over a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte's alcohol abuse:
The big brother Jussi and Andte drifted into the BB house on Monday night.
The Jussi, on the side of the basement, was on the trail on Monday night with a gymnastic with Andte, members of the Kartano population.
The twins wondered what their actions looked like in the program viewers ’ opinion.
Not that way until you see it, Andte said.
Jussi feels that most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or assignments make up only a fraction of the life of the BB house.
More than that, we wait and wonder and talk and live.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday night, the people of the Cartano spent the night on wet signs, and alcohol was especially turned on to Andte's speaking party.
So Jussi asked Andtel if the parties had made a man’s life in the house more meaningful now that he had reached a small hipraca to discuss them with other inhabitants.
A little drink, that's when it comes to the case, Andte admitted.
Look at Andte's interview on the ISTV video!
Anna Abreu reveals her body passions in Me Women.
Anna Abreu says in the Me Women magazine that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she stayed on the job break.
At that time, tired Anna thought weight loss would give her more energy.
Fred Montana/Sillash News
Give me a dream a couple of years ago about a body type of Victoria's Secret model.
My body design was Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, and Anna's telling the paper.
Anna, who presents her body with gigs and music videos, says that there is no passion queen, even though she has been named as such.
Viina Kytöjoki
The one in Timm, Anna, who's fine with the gym, and she's doing boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can raise a certain amount of weight on the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes a pop star gives himself the right to make it feel good.
If I'm sensitive, I'm really sensitive.
Sometimes, I'm pulling off some unhealthy nights, and I don't think about more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I hate it if I do something bad for my body.

Anna says she likes her body.
Corporate profit distribution pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Are Australia’s stock companies’ directors today just trying to please a large group by granting shareholders’ wishes for a greater division of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power to move from corporate governments to shareholders served by the government?
The distribution of profit is most important, appeared last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of the companies’ shares that have awarded investors in the form of buy-back programmes and more profits have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with it.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that the consumption of capital is reduced faster than those predicted by analysts, and that is why many people ask whether the popularity of the short term is too much and whether sufficient focus is on the growth of the immediate and long term.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding will be obtained, for example, from cheap stock markets.
From a company's point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, whereas there is no capital.
However, even if the resources acquired from the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear that the generosity towards the shareholders is primarily financed by the fact that the company spends less money on investment.
The net result of the wave of these buy-in programmes (and the cancellation of the profit and loss of investment plans) is the decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls for this over the reporting period for the period during which the companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares down.
As part of the same plan, companies increasingly have less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of buy-back programmes was $3.7 billion and the expected value of unrealised capital procurement programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to keep capital spent in a title of his report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has already existed for months.
The head of the Australian central bank, Glenn Stevens, had to point out a few weeks ago that companies needed a little more fighting to increase their investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects for individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as slow capital consumption generally leads to negative economic growth and employment consequences.
Credit Suisse says that, on average, the own estimates of the consumption of their capital by the reporting companies have decreased by four per cent over the last two years.
Estimates of free cash flow have risen by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick look seems to be good from the point of view of current shareholders and stock markets, but it is also some kind of proof of the obedience of companies.
If I had a coin every time the CEO said that the price of the stock for a short period is not important, I would... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not correct.
The CEOs monitor the prices of the shares very closely and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long bonus packages of suppliers are defined according to the value of the shares, and the position of the directors depends on it.
The CEOs want to say that some decisions (even if they were company transactions, increased investment in an organisation or profit distribution) are not always immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that the investment market has a very short-sighted approach.
Therefore, the current level of Conservativeism seems to be a short-term commitment to the objectives.
In their view, there is no concern about the low stock market and the saving of capital, but it was too clear during the reporting period that the weight was to reduce the consumption of future capital, and the most savings companies were praised.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the number one player in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also acted likewise – part of the escape and part because they were afraid of shareholders’ reaction.
Why, then, do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse's strategy, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other, more traditional fixed-value investment products have been reduced when suddenly the central banks have decreased interest rates worldwide to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors have been forced to look for profits on the capital market, and in turn pressure companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would prefer money on the same road as more and more investors approach retirement age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution had a significant impact on companies' cost cuts rather than on the increase in turnover.
The event of spillage of published minor images appears to be information-pressed or to be hacked into an email account
Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources suggest that the unknown hacker leaked videos to the Internet surprises information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female publicists in a chatroom and said that he has more images of women, some of the photographers have reported that their images are faked, while others have said that it was a long time ago about the pictures removed.
The pictures are a lot, and the group is called Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton, and an American actor Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is the way in which the attack was made.
And were the pictures and videos real, and where were they downloaded?
The main source of news for images – shameless and profound attack on Apple iCloud – is the most unlikely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house, whose task is to try to penetrate the company's own systems regularly.
“A large scale hacking into Apple’s iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim should be correct, points out the Vice-President of the Information Security Research Unit of the company Rik Ferguson, Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for the hacks (and, every day, for less famous people) associated with these persons is the leaking of an email address and password, either by guessing or using jurisprudence, i.e. by fooling a person into a real-looking site, after which this information is used against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used to store settings in iPhone phones and, above all, the backup of images when transferred to the Cloud server.
You can log in to the user's account via iCloud service using this email address and password, after which their image and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account holder has introduced a two-step identification \"two factor authentication\", 2FA), i.e. an additional protection against intrusion into the account, in which case the owner’s mobile phone is sent before the account can be logged in.
However, it is rarely used, either because it is not known, or because it is considered incomplete.
Apple will continue to examine whether all information is based on its iCloud service, and if so, how widely intrusion into the accounts of users was.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this issue at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the \"Do you forget the password\" link in Apple iCloud service by collecting the e-mail addresses of the public, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that publishers have used the same password in several services, when passwords were kidnapped through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's images claims that the images are real, but don't tell us when they were taken.
In his tweet, Winstead said that this could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took to be a creepy trouble.
I feel compassion for all others who were targeted by the hacking, he wrote in his Tweet.
However, the independent information security expert Graham Clley points out that Winstead may have thought he removed the photos from his mobile phone, but removing the image from today's smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Today's smartphones regularly record images of cloud service because they often do not have space for a large number of user-owned images.
Apple's iPhone standard setting is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones to store images for OneDrive service.
Independent service providers such as Dropbox provide automatic image and data storage service.
People take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that they download images from an account, so Clley says to The Guardian.
Mr Ferguson agrees: \"The one who has not always been removed does not always mean that he has been removed,\" he says.
Pictures and videos can be stored for years.
If someone accesses the user's email address and password, they can reload all the photos and videos that have been sent by email.
Apple service can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot that was claimed to display videos and images taken from Windows PC so far unpublished.
Two-stage identification protects against such hacking because it requires everyone who is trying to copy an existing account to another device to give the original user a code, usually a mobile phone.
Without the code, you'll be prevented from accessing the account.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-stage identification account, but it is not yet known whether these public users used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures they claim to be in are not genuine.
The representative of Aria Grande has said that the pictures he claims to be in are \"full counterfeit\".
Victoria Justice, in her tweet, wrote: \"I've taken pictures of the nakedness that you don't understand.
Let me break the roots from the rumors right away.
Well, it's a different option, Mr. Cley.
Since the application was targeted by public authorities, they may have been broken into their accounts by someone who handled their social media accounts or regularly managed their e-mails.
- I'd like to know if there's an actor's agency or some representative involved, he's thinking.
However, these persons do not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems of the victim of the security attack or helped in its configuration, and changed the system secretly so that all the data can be returned.
This happened in the case of Christopher Chany of Florida, who had received the name \"Hollywood hacker\", where the hacker distributed photos of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis's e-mail accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to 10 years in December 2012.
Chaney was accused of entering the e-mail accounts of over 50 entertainment people during the period November 2010 to October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of the star in the name of this stylist and then published them online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions must have been one of the worst violations of privacy that can be imagined.
Chaney was also alleged to have established two persons online for more than ten years.
Well, according to Cluley, \"Chaney, the stars were hacked into the e-mail accounts, and they were modified so that someone sent their data forward even after the password was changed.\"
Cluley says that the coercion of hacks breaking into these accounts reminds the collection of butterflys.
They just want to collect information like this.
In this case, it is possible that someone had run into a list of data and log-in data in these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
The hackers have also been able to try to penetrate for a long time.
or they got access to someone's e-mail account information, such as the address book, and then they were fishing other people's data.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud's safety hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to assist the UN in tracking 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by terrorists in Syria associated with Al-Qaida.
The Terrorist Group, Jabhat al-Nusra, is believed to hold 44 Fijin peacekeepers imprisoned last week and forced UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since the middle of the week, and their location is unknown.
Ministers, such as Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon at the summit, and he has offered Australia's assistance to save the missing peacekeepers.
“I have assured you that Australia will help the UN in everything you can, by providing intelligence assistance, ” he said to the AAP news service in Samoa on Monday.
We're very much in touch with all of the intelligence network's cooperatives and friends -- to make sure that we can locate them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already convinced the Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama and the Foreign Minister, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippines peacekeeper group held in military armies was reported to have escaped in different parts of the same controversial region.
The UN has been monitoring Golan's hills since the ceasefire of Syria and Israel in 1974.
The assassins are trying to steal your money by means of a carbon tax withdrawal initiative, warning the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
The assassins are using the carbon tax withdrawal initiative to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The SCAAMwatch Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses that they are confident that government agencies will be too good in bids offering thousands of dollars of credit.
Snipers may use the numbers seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save goods when the carbon tax is abolished and offer it up to $7,000, the warning says.
The assassins may sound very convincing, as they have identified the victim's personal information, which they use to try to get their hands on bank information or try to get the victim to pay the fee.
They're discussing current topics to trick the victim.
They're using more than carbon tax fraud to access money. Their stories are more advanced, and they're using up-to-date things to build a scam around them.
Also, the MH370 lost aircraft and the death of Robin Williams have inspired frauds on the flight of Malaysia Airlines.
The ACCC instructs the company to contact the company with the information that it has identified, instead of the contact information provided by the caller, if there is any doubt as to the identity of the player representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or e-mail from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation because of the set-aside of the carbon tax, please be on your guard.
If you think you've been fooled and given any personal information or transferred money to a fraud account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, free money provided by the government – it is likely to be.
Financial statements: Lipponen blames the EU for Russia's sanctions
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions imposed on EU Russia in the interview with the economic reports.
Russia's priorities in politics are to serve its own interests.
There's no need for sanctions, Lipponen says in an interview.
Lipponen has started its work as an investigator for the business of the Central Business Union of the EC Arctic Regions.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the European Investment Bank (EIB), interrupted Russian project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
This means, for example, that environmental projects of the northern dimension with clear vision go on ice,\" Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of funding is now hampering cooperation, which Lipposen said could be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Ice Sea region continues to be as high as before.
He is currently conducting an EC study on the Arctic policy and business opportunities in Finland in the north.
It does not affect the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
We'll look forward to the investigation, talk about tens of years, he says.
It is rare that norppa comes to a low level of water or an establishment nearby, notes Visa Heinonen from the study centre of the Museum of the Northland.
On Sunday, Norway was seen in the summer of Vaasa, swimming near the beach.
Heinos said that norppa has probably come after Suvilahti's food.
It's not a mess.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinone tip.
For example, he said that the Sundom Bridge will be seen especially in spring and autumn Norway, which will arrive precisely after the fish.
Still, Norppa is not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Region.
You see norppi on the pay ground at the villas' representations, he goes on.
Norppa lives in the Gulf Sea and the Sea.
According to the South Australian Court, the murdered pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga acted aggressively and violently outside the nightclub.
Murdered south of Australia with a pizzeria owner Robert Vallelon.
In the trial of justice, Robert Vallelonga, a pizzeria owner, acted aggressively towards both his partner and his security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the club.
The lawyers accused of the murder of Vallelonga requested the release of their client against guarantees in the Lower Court of Adelaide, because it was clearly self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been published, behind bars until the trial.
The evidence says that the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the club, he said.
After that, the man who was 40 years old got drunk started to tear up his security shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, one stroke was caused by death, which clearly indicates self-defence or the defence of another.
A 25-year-old man is still charged with murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious at approximately 2.25 p.m. near Rundle St and Synagogue Place on May 4, which had serious head injuries.
He died of injuries in the royal hospital of Adelaide the next day, friends and pizzeria's clients were dying of the local legend of One Tree Hill.
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the murder, and after the incident, he had told the cab driver that he had put someone to sleep for a few days.
But the security camera's video shows something else, Shaw says.
\"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down, and he got his share of tough and violent behavior,\" he says.
Our client has both the assumption of innocence and the evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three security guards who had been present at night had intervened in Vallelonga's behaviour.
They said that other security guards didn't think he was a threat because he was short, and he was using a big man's vocabulary room because he wanted to avoid physical clashing.
They said that the taxi driver, who saw the case clearly, would prove that Vallelonga was hit hard and had no chance of defending himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
The contested dolphin hunt began in Japan - based on tradition - foreign news - East Santomas
Bad weather was expected to be delayed in the world, largely at the beginning of the bad hunt.
In the city of Taij, Japan, the annual dolphin hunting season started again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
Much opposition to yachts around the world is reported, among other things, by the British newspaper Guardian.
In the yachts, hundreds of dolphins are driven to the remote bay, where mammals are slaughtered after the selection of the most suitable individuals to be transported to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The dolphin meat also ends up for food.
However, according to the local authorities, the beginning of the hunting was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
In 2009, information about this practice spread to the world, along with a documentary film called The Cove.
In the past hunting seasons, the hunts have been criticised by diplomats, not only by animal conservationists.
In any event, the opponents claim that dolphin meat has a limited market because of its high mercury content.
According to those defending hunting, including Japan's government, this is tradition.
The advocates have also reminded me that dolphins are not endangered.
The dolphin hunt was already opposed to demonstrations in several countries during the weekend.
According to the Protestants in Tokyo, Japan’s reputation in the world is damaged by the hunt.
Also, on Monday, a demonstration was held in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some of NATO Member States are uncertain about investing new troops in Eastern Europe
The military union within NATO is divided into whether or not NATO bases should be set up in Eastern Europe and the Baltic, in response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military association to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
“Ukraine has given a new perspective to Russian politics, and it threatens to bring European security down, ” said Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute of London.
NATO Member States are on the table at the beginning of the week, and the military union is to publish its new contingency plans.
The key issue of the plan is whether NATO can break the conventional arms agreement signed in 1990.
There the NATO and Warsaw Association agreed on how they invest armed forces in the area between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the agreement.
In view of the tightening situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
The President of the Security Committee of the British Parliament, Sir Malcolm Rifkins Financial Times, must have the resources of NATO in all NATO countries that need its resources.
Matt Guthmiller, the youngest world flying around
When other teenagers learned how to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
The 19 - year - old Guthmiller just became the youngest – and yet alone, reports CBS News, Carter Evans.
South Dakota’s young flight to 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five different parts of the continent.
On his way to Guthmiller was treated like a rock star thanks to its record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
- Too risky. And someone spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little bit of the world and have some fun.
Guthmiller did not have much to say to those who submitted such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it included a lot of work, and I hope that with my record, I will also inspire other people to go to the world and do big things.
Guthmiller's flight performance started when he was young, first he asked his parents to go to the airport cafes.
Later, he insisted on getting to the flight classes.
My parents let me out on a short, 20-dollar-payed, 20-minute trip, but I think they'll think I'm gonna stop getting excited about it.
No, he didn't.
Mr Guthmiller soon then made an agreement with his parents to give him more time at the cab.
I and my dad agreed to share the whole high schooler of the car instead of getting my own car.
I could fly planes at the exchange store.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a flight licence and, two years later, he leased a single-engine Beechcraft for a single flight around the world.
A young man studying MIT high school handled the aircraft itself and made fuel calculations.
Many hours in the top world also meant that he himself needed extra armor –
practically a lot of caffeine and Oreos biscuits.
Guthmiller says he's eaten a few biscuits completely during a long flight.
Flying to the clouds was both amazing and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries had no control to help them navigate the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane and which were up to 45,000 feet and torn to pieces of the plane.
Guthmiller's plane was unpressed and there was no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel would not have been higher.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died of his plane falling on a flight between American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his trip the hardest part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he feels that the rising phase is technically challenging due to the high fuel required for 16 hours of flight.
However, despite the pain of risk and even the high place, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for the ATM training through the Code.org website.
He's a coder himself, and he started his own business when he was 12 years old.
Guthmiller's goals lie in the sky.
It would be great to start the next Apple, but let's see how that works.
In any case, Guthmiller is going to go high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
It's harder to find a real French entrepreneur than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited to join fans in his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after the Canadian W-TV channel began to show The Cupcake Girls-tosi-tv program in 2009.
The inspiration continued until it became clear that one of the French entrepreneurs was not an appropriate task.
\"My French contractor sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers line up outside the store to buy a cup of cake, and he can't stand the situation,\" said Joyce.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the incident, Joyce decided to change the process of selecting French partners to stress the company's cultural management skills rather than the bakery skills.
\"Whoever can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear,\" he says, adding that he's had about a hundred interviews with each 11 French business.
We start six weeks of training, but the workers work in a completely different way themselves in the working environment, so the whole process is rather difficult, and so we have to focus education on the most appropriate business culture.
Finding the right French entrepreneur is vital to the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader can shape and grow an organisation, while a poorly qualified leader can cause costly damage to the company.
Before I thought it would be like a date to find a French entrepreneur, but it's not true at all, you can do a lot to get to know another person before we get married, Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a French partner, an agreement is signed, a guarantee is obtained and a new shop is built.
Getting involved with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a major test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the Franchises and the strong marriages, because they have common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan also believes that the French entrepreneurs should be careful to choose the future French donor before taking up such a long-term partnership.
This is the same idea as human relationships: if a date partner is already rude on a date, imagine what he's like in a marriage, he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and assess future contractual partners and to draw attention to the smallest alarm marks from either side.
McLachlan adds that French teachers such as Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time those who work as a French teacher must be more careful when choosing the first, the most important partners.
On the other hand, the new French donors must conclude on the basis of the expected success of the parent company, the challenges they have faced and the skills that the new French entrepreneurs need when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies operating as French donors can also ask for the help of a French advisor to create a sector-based profile.
McLachlan also reminds us that for the first time as franchise donors and entrepreneurs, there is a lot of help available on the CFA website at loopforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be much easier later, as French teachers learn to better assess potential entrepreneurs, but also because the first French entrepreneurs can provide advice and help in the evaluation.
“The first French partner’s contribution to help Brian (Scudmore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK) significantly in the creation of this company and the French system,” says Erik Church, O2E Brands. O2E Brands, including companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
The Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't create alone, so the first French entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Church has 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a partner of You Move Me's Toronto Franchise.
The chhruch method for finding a real French partner is simple.
\"I'd like to ask this person to go to the weekend barbecue? \"\", he says.
\"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably do not want to spend a large part of your working day looking for solutions to big business challenges with them,
Furthermore, the Church points out that the O2E Brands company is largely thanking its French-structure for its success.
In the organisation of companies, managers often see their position as a short-term and lower level of leadership as very official, while French entrepreneurs are pursuing a partnership with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the company’s success.
\"The French partnership has much more positive aspects than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intensive,\" he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but if it is properly managed, it will produce better results.
Railway delayes lower cereal prices in the northern United States
Delayed rail transport has led to a significant fall in cereal prices in the northern United States centers, weeks before huge crop is expected to be under pressure from the transport network.
Commercial cereals in the North Dakota state offer farmers only $2.7 by bus from around a dollar less than control prices - mainly because of the cost of ensuring the capacity of the train tracks receiving them, by merchants and by agricultural organisations.
IN Raw materials
The problems are the most acute of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway railways and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
The Federal Railway Supervisor will hold a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains need to rely on irons for the transport of agricultural products, as they are far from river networks.
The delay in rail transport increased as the spring of 2013 followed a very cold winter leading to slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from the North Dakotan Bakken oil milling plant has set aside grain transport, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to the director of an international cereal trading company, the costs of ensuring the use of the train have risen from zero to up to $2,000 per year from a wagon.
Someone's got to pay the bills.
\"These costs will be borne by either the farmer or the client,\" says the manager of the cereal trading company.
The United States Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota's soya beans will increase by more than a third and by 16% in the spring crop.
Randy Gordon, Chairman of the National Grain and Feed Association, says: \"We are normally trying to start a new harvest on a clean table, i.e. the harvest has been emptyed with sufficient storage space and grain has been sold and transferred.
Now, however, we are starting late due to the service problems of trains last year.
The railway company, BNSF, has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year’s harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President of the BNSF for the transport of agricultural products, said that the company has reduced long-term transport (ordered train wagons ordered by customers, which have passed more than four days) from the start of April to around 16 500, to about two thousand.
“We have moved almost all the old rain that we were supposed to move, ” says Miller, referring to the surplus grain from the previous harvest.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF grain trains were 9 per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
The Miller admits that the development is \"unusual\" but noted that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year in order to improve the handling capacity of all types of transportable products such as cereal congestion.
The speed of trains in the Canadian Pacific, which has suffered a second sum, is 11% lower than in the same period last year, but clearly higher than the much lower speeds of the first year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Undertaking has told the Railway Supervisor (Surface Transport Board) that changes in its ordering system should improve its ability to handle traffic in the coming harvest period of 15% to 20%.
\"The Action Plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company focuses on the continuous improvement of train speed and the efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more trains every week,\" said the rail company representative.
The crisis in Ukraine may resolve the NATO identity crisis.
The leaders, diplomats and experts of the great countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of the NATO mission in Afghanistan also means the end of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is apparent at the NATO Summit in Wales, which will take part in 60 leaders this week, including President Barack Obama.
The mission list of politicians and diplomats does not lack the world's crises, even to the extent that the exit of Afghan troops, which used to be a priorityist, is no longer the most important issue.
Instead, there is a need for 28 state alliances to re-enter Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that the threat of European independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also transfer troops, promise more money in defence expenditure and commit themselves again to defence cooperation.
In some respects NATO is thanking Vladimir Putin.
\"It (NATO) is looking for a way of doing this -- and it had a rather significant identity crisis,\" says Heather Conley, director of the European Programme for Strategy and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but it has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy for the rapid popularity of the Islamic State's militant defeat in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinion, the President will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his armed partners in a military response, particularly those crossing the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy to win the exemplities, once he has made clear that we do not have a strategy.
Western experts have put cautious expectations at the summit as to whether breakthroughs will be achieved when discussing Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Further economic sanctions are planned as the main means of sanctioning the event called the Russian attack in Ukraine.
The European Union officials dealt with this during the weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries that Obama hopes to be the main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily NATO members.
Two years ago the previous NATO Summit was held in Chicago, when the debate ruled the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates, the leader, took his last speech to say that the organization has reached a point of common military integrity.
U.S. officials were constantly complaining that no other countries had reached their financial targets.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this target last year.
Now, however, officials in the White House say that they have noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff in which they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire to see any threats to their actual composition in the Member States.
After Russia entered Ukraine, the defence promises are more important and more important than ever after the end of the Cold War, says Charles Kupchan, the President of the National Security Council of the United States.
We are rather hopeful that we will achieve consensus between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of his trip to strengthen its commitment to the defence cooperation in favour of Russia's concerned neighbours.
The President will begin his three-day trip with a long-term visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Crimean Crimea this year, and NATO troops will be recycled regularly in Estonia when a new contingency plan, which will be published this week, will be put in place.
The plan aims to shorten the time required for NATO to respond to attacks in the border states, officials say.
The plan will include an increase in air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The changes reflect a small risk for NATO, which abstained from setting up permanent bases for Eastern and Central Europe as a demonstration of the kindness of Russia.
According to officials, the new plan does not actually break the agreement, but it can also be a purely semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to name it in the course of the discussions before the official announcement.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, said the diplomat.
With Putin' an effective-talvage device, is he using it to Ukraine?
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has one step in his sleeve with regard to Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of rebel armed forces in eastern Ukraine and of sending Russian troops to the soil of Ukraine.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine is tightened up, the Western countries are planning harder sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, has a master card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main source of energy is Russia.
According to the American Authority, the primary energy sources in Ukraine are natural gas (40%) and coal (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, acting at Harvard University, writes in Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine in less than four months and the coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country's conflict, the Ukrainians will freeze into their homes when the gas supply from Russia is stopped.
Therefore, if rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin to win the war eventually, Gurbanov writes.
Last year half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
On 16 July, Russia cut off its gas supply to Ukraine due to unpaid invoices.
Previously this month Gazprom announced that Ukraine's debt for gas was already USD 5.3 billion by the 1st of August (approximately EUR 4 billion).
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think no one will think about it (winter) anymore, except for Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
The necessary repairs and reservations must be made for the cold season in order to re-establish the stocks.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat before separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman's Japanese holding company Nomura observed last month that Russian talks on humanitarian matters and on the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine would increase in a few months if Russia could maintain separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay advance for future gas supplies unless the Kiev area pays accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement allowing gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week, Prime Minister Arseny of Ukraine said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies in the EU in the winter.
Later, Russia's Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, told us that the talks are unfailing.
He said that Russia will do everything possible to deliver gas to the EU countries.
The Liberal Abibloggari received 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand freshmen
The Saudi courts have held a ten - year prison sentence for Raif Badaw, founded by the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The judgment contains a further penalty of a thousand stripes and fines for a million shelves (about 200 000 euros).
The judgment was founded on the establishment of a website that despises Islam.
On Monday, Suad al-Shamar, the second founder of the organization, told AFP about the judgment.
Badaw himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was already sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and 600 rapes in July 2013, but the judgment was appealed and retrialed.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when, as regards its injustice, Amnesty International also pointed out.
Madventures Riku Rantalan's childhood experience in Afghanistan: “It was one of the changing attacks of human beings.
Madventures published today a new book World Explanation - Adventure's explanation of everything.
We asked Riku Rantal about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also relates to the most important human attack in his life.
The author, reporter, the second half of Madventuries, Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday there was a movie shop at the Citizens' Square, and Wednesday the second production season of Ylella Docventures begins.
He's been running from place to place since morning.
From Maikkari's morning-to-day TV to the day-to-day home and from there to the week-to-week party.
A face-to-face interview shall be carried over for a telephone interview.
Otherwise, you won't have time.
In the middle of all the rush, he and Madventures have had time to stop and write the World Explanation book, which according to the book's cover, is an adventurer's manual for everything.
All right?
Oh, quite promised.
The book looks at a number of themes, like what our future is, why one culture does worse than the other, why we are here and who we really are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book contains experts, both professors and artists.
We actively worked on the book for about a year, Riku tells the IS by phone.
You've discovered a pretty big piece of the book.
What is the main message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and that it is worth considering, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the idis is to be good at readings, but it is also to get people at home to discuss and share ideas.
The debate may even lead to action, says Riku.
KOVA: Pete Aarre-Ahio
One of the themes in your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We came to the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite the warming of the climate and the current state of the earth, we must believe that at some point we are making decisions to improve our situation.
The world is a kind of alcoholic.
At first, it should be admitted that we have a problem, only then can the change, Riku philosophize.
The crime says that according to some studies, Western mankind has reached the top of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This can be explained by the fact that, when we have enough money and our basic needs have been met, we are happy.
Money doesn't add to happiness.
We want to wake people up and discuss what is good enough.
Using our natural resources will not be enough for much longer, Riku says.
In your book, you also considered the differences in culture.
How does an Indian person differ from Finnish?
People don't differ very much.
Of course, the starting points for education, health care and hygiene are different.
The big cultural difference is that the Community's meaning is much greater in India in terms of both good and bad.
Once the Western lands are prosperous, people live more alone.
Let us isolate ourselves, and it may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
If we could find a proper balance between sociality and loneliness, we'd be pretty close to happiness, Riku tells us.
The crime has faced many different people in the world.
What human encounter has become the best of his mind?
It is my childhood, when I was with my family on my first big trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was there at the United Nations.
I was seven years old, and two of my little sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby.
At home, a big moving car was taken to Finland.
We drove into a war in Afghanistan when there were huge numbers of refugees on the roads.
On the road, a girl my age walked on her little brother's lap.
I was sitting on a big mermaid's bench in the kitchen can.
Our eyes crossed, Riku describes.
You're an old kid who realizes the situation.
It was one changing human encounter I always remember.
KOVA: Leena Koskela
Riku and Tunna at the book fair in 2013.
At that time, I went to the karate to see that other people must be respected even if they are much poorer or they do not have the same living conditions as we do.
The crime already realized that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From adult memories to surface people in New Guinea.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditional people lived there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, not just using money or metal tools.
They live under very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to get through.
It made me think.
And to think about it, he wants to get his new book readers, too.
The idea is that our book inspired people to read, watch and listen to more.
To make people act from warm love to conversation or even from fistfight, Riku throws.
It's about Kahajoki's magazine.
The events moved from the time the couple arrived on the bus to the station and ordered a taxi.
When the cab went off, a man in the yard threw a cab after him.
The driver got out of the car, the same man as the passenger.
The man who had been thrown before him stabbed the man into the head life-threateningly, and his hands and left the place.
The stabbinger is a five-to-five centimetre, short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, light poncho woman near the scene.
They're hoping to contact the police.
The police are also asking for clues from anyone who may have made observations about events or persons involved in the case.
The stabbing happened on Wednesday at 7.50 p.m. on Wednesday.
- Moi - told the brain - the world's first-telepathic - the message passed through the Internet
Scientific publication PLoS ONE has published an article that states that the international group of researchers has been the first to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were:
The test was carried out to monitor the electrical brain curve of the test subject.
The sender was trained with the help of the program to send bits either by hand or by thinking about the movement of his leg.
The pattern of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of the hands was the first.
This bit coded data was sent through the Internet to the recipient.
The recipient was caused by magnetic stimulation to detect light outputs per bit encoded in each one.
The recipient had been taught to interpret the flashes as messages.
Researchers admit that this is still the area of research in their children's shoes, but believe that computerised telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Packages - Point - The Future of the countryside
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening up its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia is fighting in Ukraine and manipulating Crimea.
In international politics, the reaction follows the reaction, act as countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions are only over the long term.
Iran's nuclear programme was only tended to negotiate after years.
For decades, the South African racial government sat in place, even though trade was prohibited by UN decisions.
There have also been sanctions against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to take top electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put obstacles to trade on the world side.
The latter was the frozen raw timber store.
It is clear that sanctions against Russia will not get to its knees.
Russians are used to bad times and Violeta's disappearance is not a panic.
When the EU intends to ban vodka imports from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians will drink that vodka for themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French will be allowed to export air carriers to Russia, but Finland will not be able to export milk.
Gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
There is no major disadvantage for Russia to import cheese or stop export of vodka.
The main problem is the constraints of the financial sector.
They only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on international loan markets.
It has to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Although Russia has huge reserves of currency, they do not last forever.
The credit received by Russian companies is subdued and the money is rising.
Their own banks are not able to finance everyone.
You have to press more money or you have trouble with your businesses.
Competitions are competitions in Russia too, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia's modernisation will stop, as René Nyberg, the Russian expert, wrote in Helsinki's Words.
It wouldn't be the first time.
In short, Russia would return once again to Russia and step in.
In North Korea, an exceptional free button event was organised
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed international press games held in Pyongjang in the capital on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, a Japanese citizen from the Lawyer to a free wrestler, took part in a campaign from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free spins, taekwondo matches for local athletes were also seen.
According to Inok, the goal of the event was to bring the countries affected by sport closer together and promote world peace.
The politicians expressed their wish to improve between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed sanctions for North Korea as a result of the Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, on the other hand, promised to reopen the investigation of those cases.
The latter was seen in North Korea in 1995.
SOK reduces around 110 people from the trade in goods.
The Yt negotiations began in June, when a reduction was estimated to be up to 130.
According to the company, its organisation has now been broken down into overlapping functions and areas of responsibility.
SOK tells us that it is seeking actions with a clearly better cost-efficiency and synergies between the various sectors.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, there is a structural change in trade that has fuelled the trade in goods in particular.
The result of the S Group's stock trade has been a loss for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and directors of the SOK’s service and up-to-date store, i.e. a total of around 530 persons.
Turun Sanomas: Some medicines for self-treatment behind the counter
According to the paper, there are more medicines that can be taken without prescription, but only after consulting a pharmacist.
According to the Finnish Agricultural Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could be subject to consultation.
After an interview with a farmer or pharmacist and meeting pre-defined criteria, the medicine can be given in the background of a counter, explains Kirsi Kvarnström Turun Sanoma, Chairman of the Federation of Farmers.
Finland already has a few without a prescription, but a prescription is required in Finland.
One of these is a post-contraception product.
Corrosion to more accurate causes
Finland will pay greater attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is confused about the lack of divorce cases and prosecutions in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice's working group will consider whether the criminal law needs influence on trade and abuse.
The differences in legislation were highlighted, for example, in the case of Patria in the case of the Slovene-Hara case in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
The sale of influence in Slovenia brought a two-year prison sentence to the former prime minister, but the Finnish law does not know the same criminal title.
The cooperation network against corruption has been strengthened as required by the Government Programme.
According to a survey prepared recently, corruption is hardly studied in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a survey of corruption in various fields from the University of Vaasa and from the University of Police and Police College.

Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he's getting turs for Asian Champions League in Korea
Tony Popovic lacks three key players in Korea.
Many of the Western Sydney Wanderers team players will be banned from the first match, and Coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players at the Asian Champions League in the FC Seoul match.
The Wanderers are at a 10-day training camp in Dubai, which also includes two games of friendship in Abu Dhab so that the team can prepare for the first semi-final on 17 September.
Because of the excess of yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole leave Korea's journey, but Coach Popovic believes in their hives.
Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players in ACL for us – Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned in China from this gesture.
After all, it is a setback, none of the players should be gone, but we had no Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, I'm sure he's done a lot of work, and I fully trust the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone but against semi-finals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovich, which will continue to recover from the ankle surgery.
The defender of the team of Socceros injured before the start of the season, but has continued running, and it is possible that he will play the return match at Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
He's back in the career, and he's gonna be fine, Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is a great news for him because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's already been practicing a couple of times outside, which is good.
It'll take some time before she's fully in order, but she'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanders team has the world's top-class facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also feels that a trip to Dubai will be a good opportunity to get to know each other better after the great changes of the end of the last period.
- We know this will help the players to create ties, says Popovic.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better on both the field and outside it.
So we're using the camp for many purposes.
Elit's hamburger pays three times the employee's monthly wage.
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to belong to the elite of the country.
The Financial Times tells us about the opposites of a torn economy.
In North Korea, informal markets may flourish more than ever.
They provide a luxury for wealthy or saving ordinary citizens, which has not been used to combining the dictatorship state.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: the entertainment center, where only the ticket for entry costs up to ten months of regular employee pays.
You're gonna get burgers from the place that pay $76.
It's 3-5 months' salary for the country's usual duunar.
At the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
The North Korean West market started in the 1990s, when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to be present, even if the prices of materials can be gross at their worst.
Yet in the capital of Pjongjang many have a mobile phone with a door of $200.
Part of the reason may be the ruler of Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create a self-energy and youthful image.
In his day, the regime has stressed the importance of technology in the country’s flowering.

Ormisto House: Stormont Council wishes for sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a building in Ormisto House, Belfast, which cost taxpayers nearly $3,000 a week.
The Council bought a building from the 1800s in the eastern part of the city 13 years ago and paid GBP 9 million for it.
The Council did not manage to sell the building further, when the security and maintenance of the building came to the Council to pay about 400 pounds a day.
The building was sold at around 1.25 million pounds.
Obviously, the building will be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought a 9 million pounds building in Class B of historical value because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was resold at a price of 2,5 million pounds at this time.
The building was not sold, and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbit, the Ulster Union Party, suggested that Ormisto House could be a place for a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork has been completed.
Both the Council and the real estate agent remain silent about the buyer’s identity and the selling price.
The weekly safety and repair costs of Ormisto House are around $3,000.
The Council purchased a building from a police force that promoted Northern Ireland Police Board.
The security costs of Ormisto House by the beginning of this year totalled GBP 885 641 and the maintenance costs amounted to GBP 371 379.
The cost of repair and maintenance professional services amounted to GBP 250,015 and the cost of development and design professionals was GBP 212,466.
The building was owned by Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when Harland’s business partner William Pirrie bought it. The Pirista later became the president of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirrien died, in 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building, sold it to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-70s.
\"Education\": Helsinki plans to reduce school assistants
There's no savings, JHL claims.
In Helsinki, a radical reduction in the number of school-based school-based training assistants is being prepared.
The reduction would not concern the child's personal assistant.
In spring, the Helsinki Board of Education managed to present a total of about 2.7 million of the resources of the training assistants.
There are a total of around 600 school staff in Helsinki.
If the contractions occur, they will enter into force in the middle of the quarter immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to the Trade Union JHL, the decision will increase inequalities.
More and more children need support in learning.
However, it is unfortunate to reduce aid for savings, because the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined in law.
Savings are certainly not born, on the contrary, the working burden of the teaching staff is increasing.
For schoolchildren, savings are a greater risk of falling behind the goals of learning, and for teachers, too, is hard, stresses JHL's head of industry, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki differ from those of schools, because in future resources small schools and students in need of support will no longer receive the assistance resources at all.
The City of Helsinki aims to prevent exclusion.
There is a very high level of income prevention among school workers.
However, the adjustment measures of the educational agency are directed mainly at this group.
This will continue to be suffered by all parties.
In the autumn, the Helsinki City Council will make a final decision on the resources for which I hope to look forward to the future and act in accordance with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel Powers the Earth on the West Coast
The women of Israel are walking in a Jewish home near Bethlehem, called Gevaot.
On Sunday Israel occupied nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank near Bethlehem, a sign of the coming building of Israel in the region, while threatening the Palestinians’ request not to build more homes and threaten the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli-Peace Now Group, which opposed the expansion of the West Coast agencies, felt that Sunday events could be the biggest single takeover in the West Bank for decades and could dramatically change the situation of the region.
The Palestinians' objective is to establish their own country for the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political passion for assessing the situation in the countryside came after the three Israelis were kidnapped and killed in June after their lift in the region.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the main driver of the kidnappings and killings.
The timing of land takeover implies that it was intended as a form of compensation for the population and punishment of the Palestinians.
Near the Jewish Gevaot site in the district of Etzion, South Jerusalem is now officially declared a \"state country\" when it used to be private property of the Palestinians. This was a necessary step so that Israel could, if it wanted to, start planning buildings in the region.
However, Mayor of Surif of the nearby Palestinian City, Ahmad Lafi, said that the land belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinians’ official news office WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published early Sunday provisions in which Israel announced that they would take over the olive and other trees of Surif and the nearby villages, Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led the Israeli army on the West Coast to condemn the Islamic group in Gaza against Hamas, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The tensions along the borders of Israel and Gaza marked a 50 - day war that ended last week in Egypt for a ceasefire.
The land takeover has quickly drawn attention to the Israelis' Western coast and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government which hamper the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
Lapland’s crisis communities are generally multi-poverty
A growing proportion of the municipalities in Lapland are in trouble, is reflected in a well-being survey prepared by the University of Lapland and the University of Lapland.
There are no rapid solutions to the problems of the crisis.
According to the professor, the reduction of municipal tasks by EUR 1 billion is not enough.
The common features of the crisis are, among other things, a weak municipal economy, poor employment and migration loss.
According to Professor Akko Suikkanen, Emergy of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis municipalities are coming from the western border and from East-Lapp.
In the survey, residents estimate the situation of their municipality quite realisticly.
In the study, the inhabitants of well-preserved municipalities even had visualizations.
Excessive expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the present day’s daily life and well - being will survive, perhaps even get a little better.
In this time, you will not dare to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The group of researchers surprised the large differences between municipalities.
For example, per capita expenditure on income support varies from two to a hundred euros from one to another.
The tax revenue received per capita varies from two thousand euros to 4400 euros by Ranua.
According to Suikka, Lapland's municipalities are different.
How much money is spent, how much is earned in state shares and what is the degree of debt, is different in similar municipalities, he says.

Britain may close the borders from returning Islamic fighters
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters to Iraq and Syria.
It's a matter of reference to the government sources of the BBC.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to keep their citizens.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised and it is to be presented by Prime Minister David Cameron.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr is pleased with the immediate release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from a libyal prison
The Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, is expected to be released from a libyal prison today.
The Federal Government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities were expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that \"all goes well,\" and the International Criminal Court lawyer will be released from the custody of the Australian authorities tonight, after which he will get on a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
\"We are delighted with the news that he is likely to be released today,\" the representative commented on the issue to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanked the wider international community for its assistance and support, the representative said.
Taylor will probably fly to Rome before the journey to his home in The Hague.
Taylor and three of his court-martial colleagues were arrested in the town of Zintan, Lilya on 7 June when they represented Seif al-Islam, the son of Muammar Gaddafi, the former dictator of Libya.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took papers that they thought threatened national security.
Senator Carr has been doing a lot of work to free Taylor, for example, traveling to the capital of Libya last month in Tripoli to drive this thing.
Taylor couldn't talk to his husband or his little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short call home to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit of the Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with the parents of Taylor, Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor's parents had bet Libya to free her daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other criminal court lawyers are Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr told me a week ago that as a result of the debate between a lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, the court attorney was sorry and apologized for any misunderstanding.
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to examine the activities of its team thoroughly when its members return home.
In the course of its investigation, which has been concluded by the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that everyone who has acted wrong will be judged in an appropriate manner, when the Court informed last month.
The International Criminal Court calls for a trial for 39-year-old Seif al-Islams against humanity during their father's administrative period, which suddenly ended last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and took the initiative on 1 May in which he declared that he did not approve the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in The Hague.
Youngcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona won its second victory at the early stages of the Spanish football league, but with ease Villarreal did not fall in his home.
The blue-red stumped over the Villarreal watch, Sergio Asenjo, until the 82nd minute finally made it.
He was 19 years old, the attacker in La Liga, Sandro Ramirez, who had made his first appearance, had only come to the field 12 minutes earlier.
In Barcelona, a young man who received an invitation from the second team finished his job when Asenjo had rejected Lionel Mess's company.
Collections of Ferguson Police ended mysteriously after $433,000 overrun
The supervisors closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend for more than $400 000 for the police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old Ferguson, Missouri State.
On the GoFundMe web site open to the general public, two separate pages, bearing similar names – Support Officer Darren Wilson – and –Support Officer Wilson – have collected $235,750 and $197,620 for the Ferguson police who shot Michael Brown.
The similar site maintained by the Brown family attorney had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by many weeks of unrest and demonstrations mostly against the nearly white police forces in the Blacks, which forced Wilson to hide while the local and federal investigations were trying to decide whether he was shooting Brown for no reason.
The network collection campaigns have caused some noise in defence of Wilson, especially since some of the visitors had written a comment on the racist comments that have since been deleted.
Apparently, both pages stopped receiving donations at the same time on Saturday, and no reason was given by the page maintainers.
When attempting to visit the site, he sees a message saying, “No more money will be received!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, the representative of the GoFundMe site provided the Los Angeles Times with a notice that the site has not prevented donations from being made.
“Every GoFundMe campaign organizer will decide when to stop receiving donations, ” said Kelsea Little, a member of the GoFundMe site.
The organisers may also, if they so wish, continue receiving donations later.
“Support Officer Wilson, the profit of which was $197,620, is maintained by the Shield of Hope, a charity group composed of St. Louis police, which is the recipient of donations accepted by the GoFundMe site.
Three police officers registered as official representatives in the Shield of Hope State Collection Register, Joseph Eaga, Timothy Zol and Jeffrey Roorda did not respond immediately to e-mails on Sunday, requesting additional information on the collection campaign.
Zolel is an official informant of the Ferguson Police Department, Eaga is a close member of the Florissant City Council and a member of the Roorda Missour Parliamentary Assembly.
Nor did the Times immediately contact the anonymous founder of the Support Officer Darren Wilson page using the name Stand Up and have collected $235,750.
However, the representative of the GoFundMe site assured The Times that there was an anonymous benefactor.
Little information has been provided to donors about an anonymous benefactor of the collecting campaign, unlike the providers of the second Wilson page or Brown donation website.
Two weeks ago a message wrote to visitors about the website, according to which the page cooperates with the Shield of Hope group to become officially approved recipients of donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
The beneficiary provided additional information to visitors who wanted to receive a Gmail email address using an alias, but did not respond immediately to the request for additional information on Sunday.
In its notice to the Times, the representative of the GoFundMe page said that the anonymous collection page had been removed from the main site’s search results and added that the ‘this campaign no longer met the requirements of the GoFundMe website, according to which a Facebook account must be used:
In GoFundMe information security practices, users are called upon to bribe only users of GoFundMe who know and rely on them personally,
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe is accurate and honest.
According to Congressman Litlä, GoFundMe has, however, been in contact with the campaign organiser and has no reason to suspect his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds collected if it is necessary to launch investigations in connection with any campaign.
However, GoFundMe did not consider it appropriate to hold the funds collected by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page – Support Officer Wilson – who has organised campaigns to support Wilson, told the following page during the weekend that lawyers are trying to find an explanation – why the donors of the GoFundMe website have been prevented from giving up, but the page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page and an independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
