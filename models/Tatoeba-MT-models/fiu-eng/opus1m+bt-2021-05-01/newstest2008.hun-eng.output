European inflation has slipped on food
Speeding inflation in the euro zone is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The rise in the November price in the 13 euro area was higher than expected, with 3.1 per cent of annual inflation registered after 2.6 per cent in October - reported by the Statistical Office of the EU in Luxembourg.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely - announced by Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has, unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, not cut the base, saying that the reduction would lead to an inflationary spiral with rising raw materials and low unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate close by two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is trapped in twenty-two traps: “We need to talk about inflation so that we do not have to do this later.
In Germany, inflation in November is 3,3 per cent as a twelve-year record; Spain rose from 3,6 to 4,1.
Eurozone inflation has been reduced to a high level by rising food and energy prices.
Time-limits for wheat increased by 88 percent, and the exchange rate for soy bean reached the highest value since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the cost of food and milk products in 2007.
The world market price for oil has increased by 52 percent this year, and last month almost 100 dollars have been spent on a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5% this year in 2008, but it will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
It is estimated that the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce its interest twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The support circle of Fidesz has grown significantly since early December, so since 2002, with the largest camp, while Gallup has not measured this low socialist support of 13 percent in the past.
In the case of certain political parties, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71%) support from the MSZP against one-fifth (20%) support.
According to the survey, MDF and SSR are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the entire population is two per cent.
Among the probably voting parties, the supporters of both camps are one per cent more than one per cent.
The economic public opinion is able to further deteriorate to the previous point - it has never been that high, 41% of those who have been specifically considered to be very bad in the country's economic situation, while another 46% say that the situation is rather bad.
After the spring and summer prospects, families are once again re-examined as a slower one.
For the following year, the majority of the population will suffer further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than 71 percent of those asked believed that Prime Minister was doing his job wrong than he did well by the Prime Minister.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the surveyees either trust or trust very much, whereas 38 percent of the supporters are at Viktor Orban.
The Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent at all, the President of Fidesz has 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is that the role of society is that it can be handled dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While 35 percent of the government and the Head of Government thought it desirable to remain in the wake of the shocks last October, this ratio is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees only the solution in defining new elections.
It is an interest in referendums that 60 percent of the people asked answer the question of their intention to participate are sure to leave and another 20 percent say he would probably leave.
As a comparison, in a parliamentary election to be held on a ‘now Sunday’, only 55 percent would certainly participate and another 15 percent would be likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of the intentions of the present.
74 for the study fees, 79 for the visit fee, and 84% for the daily hospital fee would say no.
If we look at the same rates only among those who promise their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reduce the introduction of fees, visits and daily hospital rates.
The most expensive Auchan, he raised Tesco by almost fifth.
In the Budaörs trade triangle, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference that the VAT did not rise this year.
Day Economy article
This year, on average, there was an average 16 percent increase in the daily Christmas basket in the Budaörsi trade triangle, but in each hypermarket, there was an increase over a thousand forints.
Since prices have been passed in the grocery stores since December last year, there has been no dramatic gliding compared to the previous high base.
But it is clearly frightening for consumers that what they received last year was in nine thousand forints, and now they are not getting even tens of thousands.
Daily baskets crossed the ten thousand forints with the lowest 91ints in the hypermarkets tested.
The highest score was 10 573 forints.
(The basket cost 6800 HUF in 2003)
The price of Unicum and the living fish will be almost at last year's level, but the turkey juice, nuts, and livers are very expensive.
KSH's data was followed by the price of flour and bread in the shops, although in Auchan we also found a kilogram bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre repayable bottle Coca-Cola was below 200 HUF, so they also requested only 257 forints for the product together with the deposit fee.
However, this year, however, Auchan showed the most expensive in the sun’s basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, Cora 15, compared to last Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the Sun’s basket by about 18-18 percent.
Compared to last year's most expensive basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while last year's cheapest and the most expensive this year's growth was 21 percent.
Forint was an average of 1480.
Last year, the average price increase came out to HUF 1206, so that at Christmas last he felt its impact on VAT rises.
It was precisely this process that disbanded trade, and apparently they could not decide what price to use in a single product, because they were unable to calculate the effect on consumption.
(If a product's rotation rate is badly designed by the trader, it can be of great benefit to its traffic intensity adjusted.)
The price increase of the Sun’s basket was so extreme that last year it was worth more than 1720 forints in 2006, while only 844 forints were the cheapest.
This extremeity has not been demonstrated this year, since the most expensive was 1630 forints than last year, and the cheapest was 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, disaster price increases showed a more than 30 percent appreciation of daily consumer goods in the hypermarket during less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily justify KSH data: the statistical agency has estimated a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months for some basic foods.
Like flour, too.)
According to the Day basket, this seems almost impossible in the latter, since the price level of the products was already rather expensive last year compared to the base, in the worst case, the price increase of less than 10 per cent was generated.
The suppliers of flour seem to be in a stronger position than the eggers, and the dramatic price increase has been perpetuated on multiples.
In the gold triangle of trade, hypercrites don't complain, they keep reporting about a good year.
According to our experience, in the three shops visited, the customers no longer care about prices.
They buy lots of food from everything, they bring plateau food.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores developed serious lines of money prices, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we are aware that traffic is growing in the countryside, and that many researchers complain that even their plans are missing revenue, not only for food, but also for durable consumer products.
In many places they save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The conditions of the hospitals' hygiene, the complexity of the beds, the overburdening of the staff does not favour stopping the infections, states the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They save a lot of money on disinfectants.
The recent MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of John's hospital.
After a serious accident, a bacterial bacteria has been shown to be resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was separated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the same year.
A serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon thereafter, he had to return with an MRSA infection and had not been able to perform any major surgery since then due to the bacteria in his system.
By December 10, 1094, hospital infections caused by multi-responsible disease were reported to the National Nosocomial Survey System, said Böröcz Karolina, head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-responsive pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, the others are not known.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, which is resistant to phylococcus aureus meticillin.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried in one third of people's nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, alkaline inflammation, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics, can be well treated.
However, if antibiotics are used too much or not properly, the highly resistant bacteria that respond to antibiotics will develop rapidly in an inadequate hospital setting.
In particular, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently poor, severe hospital infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning may occur in patients with a weak body, elderly or low body weight.
According to the medical director at John's Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be mixed with the driver, MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the disease is not examined.
Resistance to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, the nursing staff delivers the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment, ” said Nyulasi Tibor.
Patients entering the hospital will be examined whether MRSA is present in their system, but not always infection can be avoided.
The sampling is not good.
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, but the current hospital conditions and circumstances are not favourable to preventing the development and spread of multi-responsive diseases, says Börécz Karolina.
Once this infection is typically occurring in hospitals, in elderly homes, hospitals should check patients who are inflamed and patients who are taking MRSA should be separated immediately.
However, there is no microbiological sampling in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
Most of the cases thus come to light when the patient has an detectable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological centre’s head of department.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and pathogens.
The aim should be to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. to conduct microbiological tests so that no resistance to medicinal products can occur, but hospitals do not always observe this.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the care and basic care of the patient, Böröcz Karolina reported.
Isolated on disinfectants
Scientific evidence confirms that MRSA covers one patient most frequently from one patient to the other through the transmission of healthcare personnel.
Therefore, handwashing, gloves, mask use has a very large role to play, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA spreads through a drop in contact, but in domestic hospital conditions, there is no possibility to separate the infected patient.
In fact, the hospitals are often suffocated, often very close to each other, while patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, Börécz Karolina also noted that in hospitals in unprofitable material situations they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, so there is even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Börécz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, such infection may be demonstrated or the spread of the disease may be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
The management of MRSA infection is causing huge costs to health insurance companies, so they are fighting them everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government Programme included a reduction in the prevention or occurrence of MRSA.
According to the program's success, reported data indicate a decreasing trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) shall include the prevention of the development of multi-responsible pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
There was no drunk in the death row police captain.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the XXII Police Commissioner has been prepared.
It is impossible to rule out that in DUI or decommissioned condition, he was resigned from his post in the meantime, the XXII police captain who gasped a pedestrian on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Capital Prosecutor on Friday after an expert opinion on this matter was prepared.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which has already found that the former chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
He hit a 55-year-old man on Tuesday on the road to the other side of the road, not at the designated footpath, in the XXII district, on the street of the envelope.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian does not cross the Zebrand, in accordance with the rules of the CRESZ, must also give priority to the Canary Cars.)
The pedestrian lost his life after transport to the hospital.
Because of what happened, the district police chief resigned from his post and asked for his rest, according to the police, because the case was so shaken.
The case is under investigation by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also stated that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigating prosecutors from the outset.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
Three loans, worth a total of EUR 400 million, were signed on Friday with the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental projects from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been concluded by the parties with a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the agreement now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The projects related to education also provide budgetary funding for the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be spent later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, 50 million euros of contracts were signed by the parties, which are primarily used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Andorra.
Metro 4 was also discussed in the meeting.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the financing details of the metro with the EU, it would return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Veres, this may take place in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of 8,4 billion euros since 1990.
Loans shall be covered by an EIB with a grace period of 8 years for EURIBOR and without a maintenance commission.
Bulgaria is the EU Real Estate Paradise
The development of the Bulgarian property market is amazing - Europe's attention is focused on a few countries in the Balkans.
What, where and who are buying the EU in the most expensive but expensive market?
Analysis of the distribution of Re/Max Bulgarian.
The most captivated property purchase target in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and coastal houses.
Between the mountains are the most remote regions of Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the coast of Albena, Arany Beach, Napospart, ancient Sozopol and Neszebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts in Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will eventually attract the interest of investors - including Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are buying in the specifically cheap area of Rusz.
The capital, Sofia also attracts attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best path to become one of the most attractive European golf parades, so that next to the summer and winter season, the other two seasons will be a priority.
For this reason, forward-looking investors already buy a large amount of money, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate customers in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
The investors in Malta and Cyprus are also present, and Russian buyers are traditionally present in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign customers can be listed in three groups - says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Renovated properties are purchased at between EUR 50 and EUR 100 thousand or covered houses for EUR 5 to 15 thousand and then refurbished.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, important to them is the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category was included in the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations (Bulgaria was added in December).
The third group is composed of business investors who buy in the hope of medium or long-term increase in value.
The expensive properties in the capital are continuing, as demand is increasing.
Real estate prices in Bulgaria are the lowest in the European Union, but they have increased by 21% over the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially beyond the increase in payments.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
According to the Minister for the Environment and Water of Mr Fodor Gábor, expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and after the formal opening on Wednesday, the negotiations of ministers will continue with the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Road Plan, which includes efforts following the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At present, there is a sharp debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently wish to negotiate precise figures, although it tends to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The second major issue of the conference is whether developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also undertake to provide both material and technological assistance to those countries that need it.
An agreement has also been reached on aid to developing countries.
The Fund, which is provided by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by the Management Board of 16 members, is expected to be read in the context of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) - Market and Profile.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water, Mr Fodor Gábor supports the EU's efforts to maintain the role of the flag vessel in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the post-2012 Convention, and is prepared to reduce it by as much as 30 percent, if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to commit to their responsibilities and capabilities.
In 1997, Gábor Fodor referred to a reduction of 5,2 per cent in total in the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol, including the EU 15 Member States, at that time, by minus 8 per cent.
In Hungary, the obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period 1985-87 will be met by Hungary. - the Ministry of Environment's press release.
It is high in Bali, as long-term international climate policy agreement has to be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be post-2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction system, which would be necessary in its latest report on the UN Nobel Peace Prize, Climate Change.
This would delay emission reductions and make it inevitable to increase the average Earth temperature above 2 degrees Celcius, which according to scientists would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruitment on YouTube.
In the video division, British military units are publishing footage of Iraqi and Afghan activities, with which they promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was first assigned to YouTube: the special developments in Afghanistan have been downloading videos of their anti-salib activities since March 2006 - the BBC has announced.
These footage of the mini-tape camera are checked at the operations command of the Air Force Candor and will be sent to London, where the Hungarians upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already recorded 139 recordings on the Internet in this form and “channel ” have seen more than 75 thousand.
The British Ministry of Defence, registered in spring 2007, publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan activities, while the British Ministry of National Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi international peacekeeping movements (CNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Action in Afghanistan
The Air Force's original intention was to use the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to explore the real purpose of the military's foreign presence with the public.
The propaganda published in such a form does not cost almost anything compared to the traditional television commercials - he said to the BBC, Gordon Mackenzie's defense expert - but he makes an unfailing transfer of political messages, as it proves the existence of military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans played a game
The army also has a problem with the distribution of amateur videos along with carefully edited, censored images, which also show the death of soldiers: in the slightly graphic, “official, ” propaganda films, officers talk about the maximum loss but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos of the military space in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released to the Internet, which has been prepared for sharp deployments, but the British army has only recently received it.
The Americans are doing a little differently, using a shooting game called America's Army for free to download, in which the player can hide directly into the soldiers' skin in the context of a more or less lively simulation.
It's going to be a bubbling and gingering Christmas at the ministries.
Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika does not seem to be insensitive: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold an annual work conference for her colleagues who can welcome her with pogacas and coffee from 2007.
There's a department where there's going to be a live music party, somewhere else, they're gonna put a Christmas mood in the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts, and a buffet - so amusing power.
They're ready for Christmas, too.
The biggest ministerial Christmas party is held this year by the defense wallet, but the HM does not wait for the Ministry staff.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts on the Christmas Eve, and the family members of the soldiers currently serving foreign missions will be invited, but they will also host a press reception.
The wallet is worth 25 million for the rest of the year.
The National Development Agency (NCA) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) will fire you from the skin compared to other wallets.
The GKM party is held in the Future House, with a total of 4 320 000 forints, and about three hundred and fifty guests from six hundred employees.
They're going to stick to the Christmas mood at the wallet party, but there'll be performers and drummers.
Christmas of the NFU cost 4 700 000 forints, and the National Council for Justice (OIT) was also held on Wednesday - concerts and dinner.
The field was spent in one million forints, more than 400 invitations were spent on the rest.
We know that one of the NFU's departments is also official for another Christmas celebration: it is organised by a company managing a tender, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development, from EU funds.
The building was rented for this purpose.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the competent person.
You don't need a suit.
The building of OIT was not only a guest of the NFU, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Luca-day ball instead of Christmas on 7 December.
He didn't ask for money for the use of OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's toast, and it could be a live music after dinner.
The question [origo] was asked: the ball was not bound by evening dress or suit.
Puritan party is organized by health care, labour and municipal wallet.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and celebration for workers for HUF 400 000 in its own building.
On the other hand, Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika is officially waiting for a Christmas party, but is waiting for her staff at the end of the year.
They expect 100 guests - reported by the press department - only coffee and pogács will be given, so the party will be taken out of 350 000 forints.
On the other hand, Minister of Local Government of Bajnai Gordon will simply have a drink with his colleagues in the honor of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas meeting in its own big room, for which 436 workers are waiting.
Each guest wants 2500 for the Christmas party - a buffet bet and a drink can be included.
Since János Veres is the minister, the PM workers have been equally Christmas each year.
But it won't be the party voice, it's not only the minister's speech, it's the afternoon time.
On 20 January, the farm wallet will give you a new annual reception, and the Ministry will miss Christmas.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyadvár, in the City Village, and according to the wallet, the hundred guests receive 1,000 forints per head.
This, according to the Press Department, will be a very simple standing reception, which is only official foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary.
These annual bets begin with a short welcome from ministers and finish with a restrained display.
There is no Christmas party at all from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education and Culture - they have announced with [origo] in the competent press departments.
The price of Christmas in the environmental wallet could not be found in the press department.
More than 400 people were invited to the party at the Museum of Applied Arts.
Powers of the giant strike are growing
On Friday, their National Association of League Trade Organisations and Labour Councils will be formed by their official strike committee on Monday, an indefinite date.
They are holding a large meeting on Saturday, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - which is to begin with.
The action in transport will certainly cause a significant threat, as rail transport will almost completely stop and strike at BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Organisations will present details of the Monday strike organised jointly with the National Labour Councils Association.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also begin, which will coordinate Monday’s activities.
They're holding a meeting on Saturday, and from Monday to Monday, the organisations that join the strike will cancel the job for an indefinite period if they can't reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been indicated, on the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Insurance Act, the date on which the strike started has been completed.
If the National Assembly did not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
If, on the other hand, the legislation is voted, the strike committees will meet and decide on the follow-up.
According to the agenda of the Parliament on Monday, it is possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted late at night, perhaps in night hours.
Due to the strike on Monday, significant threats can be expected in transport: work will be stopped on the railway for an unlimited period, a part of the public transport in Budapest may stop before noon, more than half of the Volán companies.
At the same time, there will also be a semi-field roadblock in many parts of the country.
Many trade unions and NGOs have joined the strike call, and these list are constantly updated on the website of the League.
Some organisations have indicated an indeterminate period of strike, others have announced temporary termination.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on a sufficient service, while the Christmas holidays are approaching more and more railways.
According to the announcements, the BKV, Budapest Airport, has a four-hour strike between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA Electricity and Heat Industry Associations, 2 and 2-8 hours of service, and the Democratic Association of the Pedagogues and the Democratic Association of Pedagogus have been called for a four-hour strike from the start to 13 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will strike in national, changed times, a two-hour warning strike by the Democratic Association of Health and Social Sectors (EDDSZ) of SZEF.
The most important of the four claims made by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal for reform of the health insurance system and puts forward a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new method of pension accounting from next year.
The third is that, in the case of a senior pension, the possibility of entering the scheme should be ensured in the case of decent jobs before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers belonging to the League of Liga (VDSZSZ) does not accept the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport's offer of railway lines, other offers are pending.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard founded this year in August have raised the political risk of Hungary and the region according to the Political Capital Risk Assessment Division (Risk Analysis Division).
The company’s risk warning said that the biggest political risk for the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that ‘with the growing ethnic tension that exists between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, even in the short term, there may be violent ethnic conflicts.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at prosecuting such an act - the research institute has added.
As it was written, this is due to a major failure by Hungarian political actors: “The public debate on Roma was handed over to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings who were able to build a political strategy for the anti-Gypsy Hungarian opposition.
This deepens the problem, makes it impossible for normal dialogue, strengthens extremes and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have been influenced by the large domestic and international media surveillance, which has significantly affected Hungary’s image abroad, especially its stability and democratic development.
It is recalled that since the autumn 2006 the organization of radical and extreme-right-side groups in Hungary has become more and more public and boosted in Hungary since the summer of 2007.
“A common feature of these condensations is to define themselves as a civil society organisation, while they openly declare the preparation of their members, whether armed, for protection (catastrophic defence, defence, law enforcement) and, in addition, the police, the army, or the State, on the grounds of incompatibility.
It has been noted that this is done in accordance with a method based on the political and party nature of society with a view to putting various political aspirations in civil robes.
The emphasis on civil society and the form of association, therefore, are not only intended to avoid legal failure in court records for these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also an increased risk factor for the neighbourhood relations.
\"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, and the ultra-nationalist political actors from some neighbouring countries wish to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased for the entire region.
As it was written, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union on the outermost side (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian dam, there are massive Roma riots that broke out in one quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
By exploiting this, BNU decided to set up a dam, saying that the organization’s aim is to “national self-defense. ”
In the past 17 years, however, there has been “little terror ” in Bulgaria, but the state remains in vain and indifferent - reminds me of the Political Capital.
They added: the initiative has brought an intense debate to the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, the increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts indicates that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that resistance is created by their own inhibition.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities with the functioning of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary respond to the threat of their own self-protection - it can be read in the risk warning of the Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, told me about the interest of telegrams: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue their risk analysis every year, and if they experience an impact on the risk change, they will inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holiday is not everywhere red.
In Hungary, the law clearly describes the red days, and around the holidays it has become a general practice to reorganise the working day, which will be less than in the future.
In the EU and America, the holiday is not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and holiday days.
Working holidays are mostly linked to church holidays, with prominent historical events.
We celebrate the new year: the last day of the old year and the new first day of work - the latter are just enough to allow the New Year's New Year to rest.
All year round, we have a total of eleven red-word holidays.
The National Holiday is March 15th and October 23rd, the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the establishment of the state, on 1 May, we celebrate the work, and on 1 and 2 November we remember our relatives and friends.
In addition, we have a two-day holiday for Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or even religious holidays rarely fall for the weekend, the work day shift has become practical in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-word holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we will not stay away from work and school on previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately preceding or following the holiday is exactly when to be worked out has been regulated by the Minister for Labour for many years in a special regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and employees employed, civil servants and those in public service law.
It does not, however, affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and, as a result, operating on business days.
This year, the schedule is only changed around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December, life stops in the country, as the majority of people have experienced their Christmas and New Year’s experiences, or use their rested freedom for this purpose.
Next year, we have more holidays in the middle of the week or the end of the week, so there will be less workday placement than this year.
First, the calendar turns around the holiday of work, so that workers can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day in exchange for Friday, Friday, May 2.
The second transfer is linked to the 23 October holiday: on 18 October, you will have to work on Saturday instead of 24 on Friday.
The end of the year can, however, be full in the celebration, as from 24 December, they will hold a nonstop break almost everywhere, even if it falls on Wednesday of the New Year.
Six hideous little things that you can piss off your colleagues.
E-mails we forget to send, audio mail we never receive, innocent lies that we almost no longer notice: these are “colored ” to work every day.
A question of whether you get used to minor inconveniences or wear gloves, and avoid situations that are consciously misleading to others.
Tips.
“ Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for the marketing department, ” says one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
At best, you're sorry and you're trying to make it right, maybe you call the marketing department to tell you you forgot to give you the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, an apology is done.
Before there is a embarrassing rescue, it is worth considering what it is to get your colleagues a few unpleasant moments and to make an conscious effort to avoid it.
You gonna borrow something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, an office device, or your phone, and it's nowhere to be found.
Do you remember that you put your fire machine on the table last night, but he liked his feet in the morning?
Perhaps you will reveal your lost pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they will be rightly angry at you to ride their property.
Don't pocket the office envelopes, post-it, because it may be unpleasant if you run out before time, and you need it right away.
You're asking about my colleagues' privacy?
There's no good way to stop the rumors that already spread.
Who, who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Do not bind everyone's noses about the privacy of your colleagues.
If one of them shares the most intimate secrets with you, don't live back with your trust.
Bury those who have been heard, and do not negotiate with your colleagues in their absence, even if others know about their work.
Are you reporting an unindictable patient?
When you call the office, and you're talking about a patient with a fiery headache, because you feel bad about it or you feel that you're going to rest that day; think of your work, you're going to have to do your job, you're going to have to do your right-hand job, you're going to have to do your right job.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know that you're not going to go into the office the next day, or you may come up with something to stay home for, you'll have to tell your colleagues and your boss not to face your absence the next day.
Dildo, vibrator, phone
Did you get involved in the job, but that's what makes your colleagues squeal?
Have you been an unscrupulous earpiece for a phone call that would have been better to hear?
Do not disturb your fellow workers with drowsy, singing, loud talk (which you continue above your head) or with footbrows, constant perseverance, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be disturbing, even if they do not get involved in a project (signature, design, organisation).
Are you blaming other people for mistakes?
If there's nothing to do, you forgot to send me an important letter, a message, so don't blame me for your memory.
Do not refer to any chaos in the office, your loudspeakers!
Admit it if you made a mistake, and the disadvantages of it came from someone else, and eliminate the sorority.
Ask him how to make your mistake right, make up for the delay.
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Machose and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not for the office!
Don't wear a comfortable free-time suit if your job permits you.
Don't be smug, your colleagues, and respect yourself by going into the office if you need a job, pretty and elegant.
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting.
Car parking in the usual breakfast traffic.
There's a special tune from the radio: the sound of a violin associated with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The music has changed and arrived next to the previous sound colours in the bass, and then as a real jewel, the female choir is connected.
The number of Zagar Wings of Love is on the mr2.
Domestic music life has been a little uncomfortable with high-quality electronic poppy for a long time.
But now it looks like it's a whole lot different when you listen to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting productions from the Hungarian digital underground change slowly in the overall image, and even though they are fashioned again by guitar garage rock, the Hungarian electropop is proof: there is new under the sun.
You started off from Balázs Pecs, and you played in Yonderbo's band until, perhaps, because you didn't get married in a czarde, you went on your own.
With her project (Zagar) and music, which combines jazz, electronic dance music, pop elements, however, she started to break through when film soundtracks were being tried to be composed (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Sezon).
The formations at the beginning of the smaller clubs were discovered by a wider audience when the Swan2 magazine in 2002 was listed as their first album among the 50 most important domestic records, and Zagar, in Yonderboi's company, was exclaimed by domestic trends that were marketable on the very only west side.
No doubt, Zagar and the band became “trendi, ” but they were not asked, of course, whether they would like to wear the label.
The band responded as it should: made a new, better record.
Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new ways for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity in the early years of Becsi.
This was one of the old orchestras of the Zságer Balázs.
The airman, flying reference, but besides the air of music, he has just appeared, according to his age's spirit and trend, the loudest guitar, the effect of rock and roll.
In these songs, at the Millenary premiere of the album, the singer, George Liget, currently working with the Puzzle band in England, showed himself.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and from morning to evening, Mr. Petőfi started to emulate the great songs of Wings of Love with the six Hungarian singers.
So everything's okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked about Züser Balázs.
hvg.hu: This new hit now raises the question: how many pieces of music you play?
Balázs Zúser: The definition of being a layer music means not much to me.
I think there are two types of light music castes; it is not a mainstream and underground, not an alternative and pop, but a comedy and honest one.
The so - called alternative underground music can be flat, nothing-tellers, and they can be prepared for mere sale, which makes them comedy.
But with a good pop, you can get it out of your honest motive.
The attitude of the host also works in this spirit, regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
Zs.B.: There are greater traditions of light music abroad, especially from us.
It's not just the twelfth grade that comes to concerts, it's the older ones.
They are more closely monitoring the changes in light music around them, as they are also a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good to see more and more of our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
We have music not for purposes, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is more visible at concerts, where it is already working on each other, but it is only reflected in the unsatisfied changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that if you wanted to answer to the audience, you were no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's working on solo, and he's building his career more west of us.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his path, regardless of sometimes trying to explain this to our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts in the other music presence and lets it break out.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi's music, since more of them were removed from his band and started on another road.
hvg.hu: On the top list of Mr2 Petőfi, the Wings of Love was first placed.
A lot of people have heard the name Zagar for the first time in this song.
Did you know that you opened up with a more popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and sell the album.
This song is about more than that.
We were meant to be the finale of the album, which we were trying to remove from the disc the audioorgia and difficult topics that have been done so far.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why are they - what was the leader?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when the idea came to create this choir from the sound of our own home music scene.
This was how the six - member choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who was then baptized in the name of Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that how you designed or formed the song?
Zs.B.: The number has been in an instrumental version for a long time, and then when the record was assembled, we thought we needed something else for this number.
The chords attracted me to make my voice sound.
I was singing the song that girls later learned that night.
It's almost at first and intimidably spontaneous.
I remember he was very excited back then, but of course, he needed the Divas.
It wouldn't have worked so hard with my voice.
hvg.hu: All the girls on the record and the concert seemed to be in the background.
No solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), no part of them, they're all singing together and they're not louder than music, so music isn't just accompanying their singing.
They were on the stage too.
Is that deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back was just because of technical problems.
But it's clear that we didn't want to share solo roles.
The song also tells us to forget a little bit about the ego from where it came from, where it goes, just let those certain wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one was the most work?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of them were more difficult than mixing than the musical creative process.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play for a race band, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where they didn't want to work for a long time, then pretty everything was in place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: Which of you is your favorite number from the new disc?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and letting the record go.
Now the Prophet Is The Foot, the Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor risked billions because of the minority feeling of the broker
It's an infidel squeaky.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociée Générale banker, thus calls his employee Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel lost almost five billion euros because of it.
However, Kerviel seems to have been just a big player after his colleagues.
Unlike the other banks, he recognized in time the crisis in the American mortgage market.
“He has reduced his spiritual ability, ” he spoke of his police officers.
However, as stated by French Le Monde, Kerviel's testimony shows that at the end of the last year, he gained €1.6 billion from his businesses.
Event not only in America
“I just wanted to make money for my bank, ” she says in her statement.
In summer, he managed to search for half a billion euros in the American crisis.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, news shows that there will be problems with the so-called subprime mortgage provided to low-income customers or customers with past repayment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and he did a good horse.
The year-end profits reached EUR 1.6 billion.
“When I was looking for the first half billion I didn’t know how to report it, ” admits Kerviel, adding that he didn’t keep anything to you.
He admits that he forged his reports in such a way that he could not find out.
Even when the Eurex stock exchange started to interest you in your transactions, you managed to fool your bosses.
The risk was a profit
Were you afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
“I thought it was just the fact that I was looking for 1.6 billion for the bank that calms them down, ”
How did you get your powers to risk so much?
He has achieved his position gradually.
He worked at the Societa Générale Bank since 2000 after the execution of the University of Lyon.
His annual salary moved around 51,000 dollars.
Two years later, he was a brothel-sponsor, and he became an independent broker with $90,000 a year in 2005.
Still, he knew he'd never make as much money as anyone else.
“In 2005, I knew that I had a bad eye on me.
As a result of my completion, my professional and personal development, Kerviel told the detectives.
The first great success came soon after you entered.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he made half a billion euros of these shares in London's bombings.
And it started a lavina - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
“This is like snowball, ” he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know about everything, or they knew more about it.
\"When I was making money, my eyes were lost.\"
Only there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
He was going to shower this weekend in mid-January.
When he started working Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that he lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find out?
He's become suspicious of his freedom.
\"I only took four days in the last year.
The broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his reports, ” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion dollars
Ministers of the Czech Government signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could make 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount available by the Czech Republic from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
In the regions, around 125 billion crowns are spent on seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most money, 150 billion crowns, is for transport.
The Transport Programme represents the largest operational programme and 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the State base for Transport Infrastructure, which will raise next year with 98.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme will help entrepreneurs and companies to win instruments for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also raise resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research and the introduction of more efficient methods of organisation.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful in the new countries in obtaining funds from EU funds.
The ex-President of Nicaragua approved the 20-year prison sentence of the court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua approved 20 years of prison sentence to Arnold, the former president of the country, for which 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion kroons) were sentenced in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in domestic detention in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will return behind bars, according to the AP news agency, it is not clear yet.
According to Ileana Perez, the President of the Court of Appeal, it will depend on the prison administration to allow Aleman to be released at home or to go back to prison.
The court proved to Aleman four years ago that he regularly referred government funds to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These fiduciary companies and their accounts actually belonged to their relatives and nearest supporters.
He then made some of these funds at the Foundation, which was set up to finance Alemán's election campaign in 2001.
They approved our budget.
That's right.
They've accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget of the coalition majority, which was drawn up by this government, without the support of the opposition.
This year, he went through with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Socialist Party could not accept the non-acceptance.
Unlike the lack of confidence in the government before the vote, there was no drama this time.
The House has generally ignored this, though the most influential law.
That's a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with some chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but the powers of the government and opposition are hidden behind the struggles.
This is more grateful for the press, which is why the media gets a lot more attention.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The public budgets of the recent Socialist Governments have been struggling with three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget is unable to solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of compulsory, so-called 'consignor' expenditures' law, which means not only pension but also social benefits, which last year are approved before the elections by the silent 'coal of ČSSD and KSČM'.
The second is the result of the first deficiencies in the deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the budget deficits for cities and regions.
However, the highest risk is not the deficit of the public budget.
This is under public and relative control.
Timed bombs are the budget deficits of cities and villages.
Several mayors can also raise money for investments other than taxes, taxes and bank loans, often inextricably issued bonds with which their city halls have been disproportionately sold.
In recent years, these debts have been offset by the massive sale of shares in the energy and other distribution networks from the state to privatisations.
Right now, they don't have that kind of source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, it is concluded that:
Like the rest of the world for a few years, our economy has been going through a growth phase that keeps on boasting the Czech Social Democratic Party.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public funding in place.
Instead, the country has increasingly been brought into debt.
The other countries produced two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, much more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is primarily the huge shame of the former governments.
We belong to countries which are at least at risk of poverty in global standards.
For example, there is no need for massive social programmes, which unfortunately have become totally unnecessary in recent years.
Although this year we have managed to eliminate part of the meaningless popular expenditure approved before the elections, even if there is no future retirement limit and pension reform, in this country there will actually end any policy, and whoever is in charge of it, this will only be a job interview.
It is a bit too much to say that from the governor politicians most of the money that is taxed tend to become mechanical distributions of pensions and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop it from being cut off by extraordinary expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would have been totally unnecessary if the former governments had not implemented everything that could have been done in the last decade.
If we do not really want to be a mere government official, then we need to be patient and calm in preparing further reform legislation for this unsatisfied coalition government, with the understanding that the state will only be able to pay as much as it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
This is the only way to achieve a balanced budget.
Ms Krejí
The banks are trying to solve the crisis.
The central banks of the US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis in the money markets.
Money markets are thus costing hundreds of billion dollars over the stock exchange.
These exchanges raise interest rates on the bank for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will put 40 billion dollars on the stock market and make another twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central bank.
After the attacks in the 11th of September, it is for the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed to a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest economic problems, i.e. the increasing lack of free capital that banks could lend, ” wrote Bernard Baumohl, a consultant from Economic Outlook Group, to their clients in his report.
“The coordinated action by central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of recession from 65% to about 50 percent, ” he added.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in non-refundable loans in the United States in the first place.
Excessors are still worth billions more of losses.
“The central banks may indeed be afraid of what might happen if they decided to take such a procedure, ” said Kieran Davies, head of the public administration of ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad, he did.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves are having difficulty accessing their loans, they will also lend more expensive loans to their customers.
This would reduce the need and put the American economy in recession with the potential consequences of global economic growth.
The central banks decided to reduce the interbank rate of the so-called LIBOR, which is used in the interbank market, to rent money.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual loans, even though central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain had reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
“There will be a similar effect to the further drop in interest rates, ” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting to the Reuters News Agency.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' move will contribute to preventing the crisis, as it does not solve the basic problem, the fall in the US real estate market.
Klaus: Unbelievable debates by ecologists
Global climate change is most likely to threaten developing countries.
The president, Mr Václav, has again expressed an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticised the international conference on climate change held in Bali.
The book Blue presented in Vienna, not the green planet, stated that the discussions of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is a special mixture of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also a fundamental difference between this accompanying rhetoric and reality.
“The debate there is absolutely without the structure, ” said Klaus.
In presenting the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important to him and that he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book would appear in German translation, because, as he said, “I often meet the karates of my opinion, ”
So now the interested parties can read an undistorted opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he considered that he had sufficient grounds to write such a book.
Since he is able to follow and judge professional meetings as an academic in statistics and in public administration.
At the end of the book, he noted that the climate is constantly changing, i.e. normal changes and that there is no agreement between all scientists on the warming of the planet that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so there is no danger and efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, unproven opinions are considered unacceptable to others, which is perceived as a dangerous freedom restriction.
Again, he explained to the present people that “it is not against reasonable environmental protection, but against militant envirentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits. ”
Similar topics were discussed in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 000 people couldn't change their licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old driver's license in due time, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for replacement so that the agencies can issue a new license in good time by the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, is not afraid that after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers would leave without a valid entitlement.
According to the agencies, the license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the tours are an interesting fall in the area of the driver's licenses, the capital offices have been flooded with requests for exchanges of rights which have increased this week's interest.
The Master’s Office will receive around 2,000 clients a day.
You have to be in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers did not replace the license.
The issue of a new license lasts 20 days.
However, the new licence may also be required with a shorter period of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver still has to pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who are unable to undertake a compulsory exchange of licenses by the end of the year and who are on their way with an invalid driver's license, will be liable to be punished as of January.
The guilty must pay up to two thousand crowns.
The police, however, may also arrange for exclusion by agreement.
In the case of maladministration, the penalty is 2500 kronor.
According to previous information from the city hall, you can also get the fine that goes nowhere.
They say you can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry called on the offices earlier to be misleading and to impose up to a thousand crowns of punishment.
However, according to Karel Hanselka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
He believes that a driver's license is a document where people can choose to decide or not.
This is not a personal identification card, which must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should cancel the driver's license.
Enough to take it or recommend sending it to the appropriate office on post.
By the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace the other types of driver’s licence.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 may be replaced for a further three years.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million further documents.
The court reduced the punishment of the Berdyclel-cooperative detectives
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík were police officers suspected of being joined by David Berdych's criminal conspiracy, and were sentenced to 13 and 10 years of imprisonment.
This is what the Supreme Court in Prague has determined with final effect, which has reduced their penalties for one of them two years.
The detectives of the Prague Organizational Crime Division were originally threatened by 14 and 12 years of prison.
No longer can we appeal against today's decision, review before the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in the same case, he is only waiting for his first judgment.
In other proceedings, he has already been punished for more than 16 years.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found that 19 people were primarily guilty of assaults, of which 16 appeals were held today by the Supreme Court.
The majority of the defendants have turned down the accusations from the beginning of the investigation by rejecting the case of speculation.
According to the Central-Czech Senate, in addition to the agreement on Berdyccl, criminals were provided with information from police sources, covering each of the robbery attacks and helping the gang to avoid being involved in criminal responsibility.
So the band gave Opava 30 percent of the robbery to Koňařík.
The prosecution is about the crimes of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
First of all, it is a robbery that has often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of public authority and non-authorised maintenance.
Because the police found illegal guns, steel-faced bullets, laser direction or machine gun during home investigations.
The band has accused him of stealing tens of millions of crowns with robbery.
A band of 20 members has already been declared legally guilty in this proceeding by the courts of other kidnappings of Berdych and many others.
Further members of the Berdych environment will testify before the court even in other proceedings, some of the cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first stage of the trial has so far prevented Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are under prior arrest in Ireland waiting for a final decision on their expenditure in criminal proceedings with the Czech Republic.
Child exchange account: 12 million
For children who are divorced, Igor Veleba, a lawyer of injured families, requires 12 million crowns of pain from the hospital in Třebíč plus court expenses.
Three million each for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostalt, has essentially disagreed with the proposal of Veleba.
“We reject this claim because it is too much, ” said Dostel after today’s trial.
“In order to obtain an opinion on the proposal, we need an expert opinion from the opponent.
We'll find out if there's any value at all.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measurable for all hundreds of thousands, ” said Dostal.
According to him, the amount should be 100,000 to 200,000 Kč between the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month until they were raised by their own biological daughter.
Veleba was awarded a fine of experts on the basis of the compensation negotiations, developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
Children’s parents, according to psychologist and psychiatrist experts, suffered various degrees of mental harm and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even when they met with such an increase as they did not prevent the exchange of newborns.
Women cope worse with the current trauma that has been experienced and what is happening right now, they put together the content of Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the birth of Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their blood - Nikola Čermák in Přibyslavica, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloňov.
Vysočina's district manager, Miloš Vystrčil at the end of October, gave families 100 000 crowns to replace their expenses, which were due to the failure of the hospital in Třebíčské, under the control of the trip.
All hospitals in Czech Republic have compulsory insurance under the law.
In the event of a mistake, they shall extend to the reserve base and may, exceptionally, request assistance from the founder.
So far, the courts have left relatively low compensation to people, the amounts being calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand tables, exceptionally a few million crowns.
Polika lost her kingdom in Vášsko
Bolek Polivka lost his address for the Kingdom of Vášsko.
According to the Ostrava District Court Court, although he used the name of King Valchi for the first time, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabish, cooperating with the coloring.
Políka didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
“The debate is about Mr Harabish and his team living on the popularity of Bolek Polívka, ” said Polík's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks that in the words of the King Valach, everyone comes to mind by an actor-comic.
Harabish shares this view.
“There is almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding money and making things up, ” he said.
He thinks the argument is the reason for the money.
“In the years, they realized that the project was successful and could win something from it.
They want to live out of our work, he added.
Future business
According to the court, the King of Minoch first used the name Políka on television.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobohatý was crowned.
At that time, however, this did not depend on the purpose of building a fissive kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing the Mintchi passports.
The original student scheme became a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, followed by Harabish based on the creation of a society of the Kingdom of Vášsko.
In 1997, by stating Polivka's consented name and signature in the passports, and even by visiting his farm and theatre performances, the owners of Polivka.
Who's taking the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabish himself had only used the idea of what Polívka made public in Manes.
“Boleslav Polívka’s popularity has certainly helped the Valach Kingdom project, ” said the judge.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was Harabish and his team in intensive care.
The co-operation of the today's collapsing parties continued until 2000 when it organised formal co-operation for the Harabish Polík in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been discussions between Polívka and Harabish, which “has been confounded in the salvation of King Boleslav I forever. ”
In the kingdom, the leader of Harabish took over Jarmila Šuláko as the mother queen.
In 2002, Polishka Harabish and his partners were then sued by a court order, which was rejected today by the court.
The battle planned by Harabish could bring light to the debate for the throne and half the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
The details and the date have yet to be betrayed.
“We don’t want to catch anything.
This is supposed to be something like a king process in Slovacko.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Políkka may continue to apply, he added Harabish.
Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: excellent prejudice
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
There are no special features of the method, the quality of the change, the driving and the production are often below average.
But the successor on the market, Peugeot 207, is significantly better.
And the guy named SW goes a little further, so there's nothing left for me to think more about.
When I tested 207 classic sixchbacks of Peugeot, for example, I complained about the place left to the head in the back seat.
This time, the complaint is now over, because the combined armour means that no more are two-metre giants suffering in this regard.
In the world
I'm going to get through the inside early so I can't repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively successful design where my only excuse for the poor console is.
I'd appreciate some more designer inventory here, if the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times in which we complained on the short side of the seat or on the arms.
Side management has also improved significantly in relation to the 206 model.
As far as the field is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the bodywork.
In the coma, the head disappears with the already mentioned few places.
I'll put my hair in the trunk.
This vehicle is therefore the main package.
This is very well available (also thanks to the conductable rear window) and should be assessed as wide space.
The empty seats are equipped with seat tires, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they can be pulled out, and they can handle harder things.
But let's just stay at the volume.
On the basis of the tables, this is 428 l, which is rather the average value for competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought out of such a class - Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation product of the mlada boleslav, then we can conclude that Peuge is significantly behind a large number of 52 litres noticeably.
This value is almost critical when you are on holiday abroad or when you place a baby.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I have to mention the almost totally straight floor after taking down the second line of backs or the very low threshold.
120 hrs in four rows
The car tested by us was operated with four cylinders of 1,6 l capacity, 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how you should look at a thousand thousand hundred who runs the family's sixchback.
It's quiet, it's small, and it's mainly drawn.
If we compare it to Škoda's proper one, which often affects you as though you've packed a rag in your exhaust, that's all I can do.
The price is high
The price of the car is not cheap.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a large indoor car with a very good engine.
The car's leaving for 329 900 Kč with four cylinders.
Car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is a lot.
The tested Premium equipment will throw up to 80,000 Kč.
Just so we had our headgears, our automatic climate, our automatic window wiper launch, our rear windows were electric remote control....
That means the car costs 531 900 Kč by road.
This is a lot, but calculates Fabia's accessories and gets very similar results.
So there's nothing left but the decision for the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is unsuccessful
In British schools, there are an increasing number of children in Eastern Europe who are concerned about the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is now faced with many obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases of violence in disputes between children of immigrants and domestic residents.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well reflected in a case in the North-East, where disputes between their seats and Slovak immigrants are growing.
Conflicts between students and ties are already in character with parents.
The situation was that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman saying a ten-year-old student with a iron gun.
The guilty man defends him by insulting him with racist secrets.
The police had to go after two twelve-year-olds attacking the Slovaks on immigration.
The girls say the man was filthed with racist notes and thrown with stones.
“When we were on our way home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and began to spit at us.
When I told him to stop with apples and pears and then reveal his naked back, “the mother of Slovak students described the new unpleasant case to the Times.
Both sides have complaints.
One of the local residents classified the debates on migrants in Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above mentioned cases indicate that in British schools, the mood between the locals and immigrants becomes tense.
Slovaks looking for 70 thousand jobs in Britain are apparently kept.
About 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, indeed, freedom is an island.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
The golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza on the beach, ice cream or masculine cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a full and even richer list.
However, there is much more to be found on an island, and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antiques.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was a rosary of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by human eyes.
Havanna has become a treasure store and re-serving wheel that the Spanish have robbed and transported to Europe in America.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the American mafia's chiefs built it, because everything that was thought to be a crime in the U.S., was welcomed in Cuba, and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Hawaii, tower houses were built; on the broad distances, cars became a symbol of cultism in the last century's 50s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Hawaii, and was his own yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated by the signatures of the stars and politicians of American showbusiness.
What about today?
You can also supply the wall of Bodeguita in Havana with your handmark.
They'll mix you a cocktail at the dear Nacional Hotel bar, as you wish.
And the cars of the '50s are going to go up to this day in Havana, because the once-exported crypts and boys in these salty and wet airs have long been decomposed.
Although the oldest part of Havana in the first place is significantly exposed, there is no such beautiful colonial monument anywhere else in the area as it is there.
Other places are getting nicer, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the necessary money, its development has received a green path.
For the last 15 years, not only have new hotels been built in Havana, but also Varader, the coast of Holguín and the islands such as Cayo Coco, Cay Guillermo and others.
Cuba in the world offers a unique taste that is appreciated primarily by train lovers.
From their widespread plantations, your sugar cane was delivered to sugar plants by steam and motorcycles.
Their motor parks have not been renewed for decades, so they are seen by machines operating there, whose peers are seen only in museums.
Where are we going?
The most well-known places are not borne by most visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write too much about Varader or Hawaii.
Perhaps just remind us that there is a museum on the Hemingway birts mentioned earlier and that who loves the author does not miss the visit to this museum.
One of the most picturesque parts of the Viňales Valley Cuba is the west of the island.
It's growing out of a stupid vegetation.
Forest formations, sawdust-highs and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and in their caves arbitrarily croped up, making it a dense crop that covers the spreads.
The valley is a place where maybe the best quality of Cuban tobacco is produced.
They can meet with their final form when visiting one of the tobacco producing plants in Hawaii.
Some might also find it interesting that Major Zeman's episode of Chile was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city, founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
The trade in slavery and sugar brought fame and glory.
The economy is the body of the beauty and monumentality of a non-great city.
The Spanish architecture in Gyarmati, which had been significantly affected by the later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the Escambray plains and the sea, is so much wrong that there were no roads in the last 50 years that would have tied this region to the rest of the country.
That certain isolation helped him to stay outside.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break down, everybody was happy to have a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon time for Trinidad, it's worth watching the interesting places around the area, like the Playa Ancón Coast or the Sugar Factory Valley.
And tonight, it is appropriate to go to Casa de la Música, which, after dark, will rise to you, where the music will be quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some view the city as the most beautiful city in the eastern part of Cuba.
This opinion must have been influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo need to overcome high and stratified mountains, and are driven by almost barely affected nature by human activity.
Thanks to the inviolable nature of Cuba, UNESCO has included the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is prepared here, the church has Columbus Cross (in reality after Columbus's shipping) and the hill, where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo Hotel stands, some of which are the most well-known El Yunque.
The coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Gulf of Disno and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabara of Tropicana, the Caridad del Cobra Patronus, the Santeria, the African religion, which the offspring of former slaves, can be written a lot of.
I mean, the way they say it right, it's better to see it once.
The Afghan allies are passive, claim the Americans.
There are also few soldiers and the lack of equipment to influence the United States' mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline concrete plans for the next few years.
The Afghan mission does not follow the ideas, agreed with the leaders of the countries of Scotland in Edinburgh, which have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to increasing resistance to the Taliban movement, eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates called for greater activity this week for NATO troops, Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance to be a priority.
“At the same time, development in Afghanistan is tangible, but the military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is allowing the population to start the further development of the economy and security themselves, ” said the BBC Minister for Defence Des Browne.
Ninety percent
According to the American government, the activity of Afghan rebels is the strongest in the last five years.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and in the southern helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about one quarter of them in southern areas.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of the teams.
They specifically asked for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We need to think about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them, ” said Gates.
In a similar spirit today, Jaap de Hoop spoke to NATO's secretary-general.
“I am not pleased with what is in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of soldiers and equipment that we need, and this is not enough, ” De Hoop told the Reuters news agency at the end of the three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Over the past few months, there have also been discussions between the participating countries as to whether all all all all allies offer the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for its passivity.
“The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where the least violence and fighting requirements are so not as high against them as against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country, ” Gates said.
This week, the Sun British bullboard called German soldiers lazy.
“ Afghan Poles have been discovered: The Germans play while our sons are fighting, ” wrote Sun in the material supplemented with the photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched an attack and published a photo of the Rögbymecce in the southern part of Afghanistan by a British team.
State debt will reach the same bill in 2009.
Each Czech Republic has 84,000 crowns of government debt.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by a crown of EUR 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic reached 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months this year, it rose by 40.2 billion crowns.
From June, however, he fell by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has thus today verified the state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic has more debts than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state has taxed over 11 billion crowns.
“For now, it seems that the lower deficit next year will only make it possible to go beyond the one-billed crown limit in 2009.
The following year, the debt will move around 900 billion and a trillion crown, mentioned the Patria Finance analyst, David Marek, the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, she sees this Next Finance analyst, Vladimir Pikora: “In 2009, we can move through a trillion.
Exactly when, depending on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation were to change in the area of politics, politicians would have been prepared to hide more, it could be overrun by 2010.
But I don't assume that change, he said.
Growth in debt
Public debt is the debt of the central government, which is mainly due to the accumulation of government deficits.
State debt is financed through bonds, public loans, direct loans, or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The State's internal debt-to-equity has now increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroons this year.
The state's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
By the end of September, the so-called available government debt reduced the crown of 803.3 billion and the crown of 13.7 billion from June.
The average duration of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
“The debt between the first quarter of the year has risen by 13 percent, which is indeed much compared to the progress of the economy.
It is interesting that the increase primarily generates in loan bonds, where the rise is 20%.
It is bad that debt is increasing, but on the other hand it shows how much it will be traded when the pension reform is here,\" Pikora commented on the data.
You'd better wait.
The funding strategy and the management of the state debt in 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by a crown of EUR 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the public budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the expected 91.3 billion crown.
Furthermore, the Czech consolidation agency is talking about the maximum planned amount of 13,3 billion kroons, ten billion reserves for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroons for public loans and 1.8 billion for loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher will appear in front of a court of Cardoons today because of the name he gave to a teddy bear.
On Thursday night, a potato court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and to leave the country because of Islamic violations.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to name a pendant as Mohammed, but Islamic religion prohibits any illustration of his prophecy.
Such an act can be punishable by sprinkling.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was a teacher of the potato Unity High School, was arrested on Sundays in her own apartment. According to paragraph 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, she was accused of Islamic violations and rebellion after the parents of the students filed multiple complaints against her at the Sudann Ministry of Education.
The story began in September, when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
“A total of eight names were suggested: including Haszan, Abdullah and Mohamed, ” says Robert Boulos, school principal.
Finally, 20 children from 23 votes chose the first name of Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but also a very common first name in Sudan.
After that, the children made a log with the photos of the bear and “My name is Mohammed. ”
The problem lies in the fact that the image of the Prophet is a violation of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues teaching at the same school, Gillian Gibbons, said that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never do anything that would offend any religious conviction.
Many students agree with this opinion. They think that the teacher is “very well treated with the children, ” and “he never speaks of religion in the class ”
Remember that in Mohamed Great Britain the second most popular first name, and there are 14 different writing ways in English.
This Muslim family has so often chosen a first name to express respect for the prophet. (The first - born child of the family is given this name.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can you get the name of a game, for example?
It's obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province during the last Vienna trial on Wednesday.
End result is failure.
The sixth and last meeting between the Serbian Albanians and the Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the Separatist Province has ended this Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
“It is a shame that the parties have not reached agreement on the status of the country, ” said Mr Ischinger, EU-diplomata at a Vienna press conference.
The U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was at stake, and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
“It is not necessary to avoid violence in the near future, but it is a very difficult period, ” he stressed, “the existence of tensions that occur ”
Intermediation Ends on 10 December
Last visit to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday is a brokering troika involving the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
The future of the Albanian province can be clarified in 90 percent after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator, Mr Bocan-Harchenko, submits his report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The 6th and last meeting of the negotiations was announced by the meeting near Vienna in Baden, since the UN entrusted the troika with another transmission in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation task will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already rejected Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, will insist that the negotiations will continue after the deadline has expired.
“Russia was committed and remains the negotiated solution, alongside the compromise, ” stated Bocan-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of sovereignty under the control of the United Nations, Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina informed me that she was willing to make a unilateral declaration of independence if the Security Council did not decide for her benefit.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
“We have not been able to reach an agreement, ” said President Fatmir Sejdiu of Kosovo, who has been attending the Baden hotel since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising, and future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
He added, however, that the idea of Belgrade's autonomy would be “a continuation of the past of murders and deportations ”
‘Domino effect-
The Serbian President, Mr Tadic, believed that the compromise was still possible, and the Albanian majority in Kosovo warned about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is still in an unstable area because of the war on independence in the '90s.
\"For Serbia, this does not preclude the possibility of compromise,\" Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation re-expressed that the decision would be made exclusively to the Security Council, where the Russian ally had the veto right.
\"The last word will be for the Parliament in Kosovo,\"
\"For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council was acceptable – announced by the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
“The negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end at the same time as they started in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that “the last word of the Kosovo Parliament’s will be the last, ” he added, that the Albanians’ unilateral exclamation of independence would be based on the ‘agreement’ of Western powers.
Bush urges an agreement between Israel and Palestine
President Bush announced on Tuesday, at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis Maryland, that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush stated that the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmer, and the Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbes agreed to immediately enter into negotiations between their peoples in order to finalise the 60-year debate.
Bush, in the presence of the two presidents, promised to support them in all possible ways so that they could sign the peace agreement in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must eliminate the ‘terrorist networks’, and Israel must abandon its colonial activity, Bush, and remind the two parties of their obligations in connection with the ‘bitter plan’ adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the goal of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel was to ‘the signing of a peace treaty with which all pending problems will be resolved, including central issues’.
The latter concern the three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: Palestine's future borders, Jerusalem's situation and the fate of Arab refugees from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived in the territory of the country of Israel today.
Abbez, who spoke after the President of the United States, maintained that future negotiations would be “global and profound ” and that they would affect all areas of regulation, such as ‘Jehovah, asylum, borders, colonyes, water and security’.
After that, Olmert, on the rise, promised that the future negotiations would be “intermediate and continuous, ” and he will strive to “be concluded in 2008 ”
Bush set out by the end of 2008 the implementation of the horizontal between Palestinians and Israelis.
Saudi Arabia said Bush had made a promise before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which was recorded as Washington's success) has initiated a plan to guarantee Israel peace with the support of all Arab countries if it withdraws from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is the answer to the history of Central East, especially because it has a problem with its roots and focuses on central issues, says the Saudi Prince in his interview with the Saudi Arabian daily newspaper.
The D.A. doesn't think the police are responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As usual in this kind of news, the official position and the rumor contradict each other.
How was the accident?
According to the first data of the investigation initiated by the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN) on Sunday, after a few minutes of 17 hours, a police car moved on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
“The car was patrolling, so it wasn’t in action. It moved 40 to 50 km/hour without sirens, ” we learned from a police source.
The two without helmets, at high speed, were driven by a green engine, not in the official register, which is therefore not to be used in road traffic (see below) with a brand of Kawasaki.
“When the right hand rule was not observed, the engine hit the left side of the police car, ” says a police officer.
The alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the crash, that the front of the car was horned, that the windshield was broken in the form of a star, and the bumper went down.
In his extraordinary report yesterday morning, the State Attorney of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that IGPN and Val-D'Oise County had been entrusted to the Public Security Directorate for the investigation, which was initiated as a result of the failure to commit murder and assistance.
During the afternoon, the D.A. said at a press conference that the police's responsibility can be excluded at the current stage of the IGPN investigation.
According to the D.A.A., three of his surveyors questioned the accident last Sunday night confirmed the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.
On yesterday's day, a strip, which, no doubt, was drawn by the pedestrians on the road, has been shown that the two vehicles collided and went together for a while until the police car could shut down.
The vehicle is reserved for technical testing.
The body of the two victims was subjected to a medical examination yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, the rumor that the police had left the scene quickly without providing assistance to the two young people.
In this context, IGPN is cautious, but it is ruled out that the police “any more serious mistake ” would have been committed.
“This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation, and it requires increased caution, ” we learned from the police source.
The Libération met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of his windows is right at the scene.
“ My cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, immediately went down to try and revitalize them, ” says the Witness.
\"We couldn't do anything now,\"
Then he noticed “a cop who was totally confused and reasoned. ”
The other two tried to relive one young man, and the fourth called,
The tension among the present ones has increased, as the two young people have become increasingly hopeless, so the incoming police drove their colleagues away from the scene by car.
Also, we know from the witness’s report that the ambulance “it arrived about 20 minutes after the police left. ”
They used a heart massage, but they didn't do it.
“I would not say that the police did not try to help young people.
Young people did get help.
Firemen have arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them, ” emphasised the D.A.
The tension in Pakistan is growing
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first protests two days earlier, after the state of emergency brought in by General Musarraf.
According to witnesses, about two thousand lawyers in the eastern part of the country in the city of Lahore were wounded by the tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces against measures introduced in the event of emergency.
In response, they threw stones at the police, several of whom were injured.
They made at least 350 lawyers.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rafalpindi, where the police attacked lawyers and injured them.
More than one person has been produced.
In Islam, lawyers registered to the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and protests have been reported as a result of the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
There were also more demonstrations in Multitan, the central part of the country, and in Peshawar, Northwest.
Since Monday, the great alliance of Dedihida Majlis-e-Amal, which is condensing religious parties, has also supported the movement of lawyers. He “soldier encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of need and to filth to those who have sworn before Musarraf, ”
“Musarraf promise no longer valid”
The exceptional measure notified on Saturday night directly affects the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
In the days to come, the Court must state the legality of President Musarraf's re-election with an indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Itftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and has been replaced.
“What we are witnesses of is illegal, unlawful and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, ” said the President to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise to leave the army to play the role of the civilian president after the introduction of the state of emergency, announced on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem.
By 15 November, until the end of his first presidential mandate, Musarraf had to withdraw his military uniform.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani Government has otherwise challenged the rumor throughout the country that President Musarraf would have been appointed as the deputy general for forced residence.
More than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This results include unwanted (24%) or unplanned or not.
Even today, more than a third of pregnancy (36%) is not planned - 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalises contraception, the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined).
This results include unwanted (24%) or unplanned or not.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as tablet or bee ring, have failed in 5-6% of the cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made ‘congenital regulation’ more effective – the study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 have taken birth control pills in 1970, but this rate has now been 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancys are planned.
Every five months is planned with precision and, if possible, spring, as this is the most favorable season for the reception of the child.
Visual improvement at the space station
Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work in space for more than seven hours to carry out the spectacular improvement of the station's scientific activity on a broken solar board.
This dangerous space mix proved to be a record in several respects: the repair had a very long time to plan, and it had to be done with the \"barked\" tools away from the living modules.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylindrical element, which will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see the box).
This module is a kind of a way for laboratory modules.
However, there is a need to take care of their electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to transfer to the final location a module producing electricity using 17.5 tonnes of solar panels, which was already on ISS.
Then the crew started opening the 76 m wide solar panels of the module.
This is when one of the harmoniously condensed tables damaged one of them in about one meter length with a stranded cable.
In order to avoid further injury, the board was not opened.
The function of the astronauts was originally to monitor the Discovery space shuttle and to correct another solar panel with a malfunctioned turn. Instead, they had to devote their full time to repair the damaged solar board.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the act on his 30-metre robot arm that was reinforced for the ship's crane.
He's one of NASA's best “film walkers ”
High, strong, highly skilled, muscled upper body and long arm.
So the 46-year-old doctor had to operate the “damaged ” solar board.
After a thorough assessment of the damage caused, he cut the broken cable and fixed the damaged area with a few “silvers. ”
In Munka, he also helped another “space walker, ” who remained near the safe passage, as well as the other astronauts, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey robot, which was used to isolate hundreds of volts of solar panels, the spaceships of the station took out and “barked. ”
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates opened the board completely, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had a half-day rest, then seven days later, the Discovery space chlorine returned to begin the scheduled return to Wednesday.
Low exchange rate of EADS shares
The EADS share price fell significantly on the Paris stock exchange after the aircraft and defence company announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in additional costs of EUR 1,2-1.4 billion.
The EADS stock exchange rate is currently at EUR 21,96 after a 4% decrease.
The company had to review its 2007 operating result forecasts, since the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is why the landing of the aircraft is likely to be delayed.
The delay in the transfer of the combat carrier, which was announced in October, will amount to between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, representing more than 1 billion of which affects Airbus,\" reported the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
As a result of these costs, EADS will have to report new design figures for its operating result in 2007 on Thursday when it will report quarterly results, including the company but did not submit any further figures.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’ operating performance decreased by 86%: this was largely due to the delay in developing another program, the A380 giant engine, which also has a high financial burden on the company.
The company originally designed to transfer A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Leaves a statusquo
They do not promise a big surprise for the Sunday elections: a large majority of Russians will vote for the State Prime Minister Putin, the One Russia.
In this context, the Russians' need for stability, to say that self-government is being demonstrated after a powerfully manipulated campaign.
Today, i.e. three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin spoke in a television message through public service channels to the voters, which have already been recorded, but the content is still secret.
Putin will lead the Kremlt Support Party, the One-Exist List of Russia, which will be expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
When the foreign ambassadors were adopted yesterday, the Prime Minister's behavior did not say anything: he only took another run against the interventions of Western countries, which was a subject he liked during the campaign.
“We know what the price is for real democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open choices, without any kind of violation.
However, the opposition says that this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they consider to have put pressure on the voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gen Nagyij Zjuganov, claims: “There was no dirty choice in Russia even in the days of Jelcin, ”
After the beating of last weekend protests, the former chess champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorised demonstrations, and according to his lawyer, he is still unable to visit.
“The Russians still think of 'homo osteeticus', ”
The predictable election results raise two even more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the head of state?
The official paper published yesterday the date of the first round of presidential elections, which will be 2 March 2008 and the candidates will be able to indicate their intention of starting until 23 December 2008.
As Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate should no longer be extended.
But there's no other successor on the horizon.
- What role does Putin play from March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and on the President as a leader of the Almighty One Russia and the majority of Parliament?
Whatever happens, leaving power wins both in Parliament and in presidential elections.
It's now turned into an atom.
“The Russians are still thinking of a \"homo ovueticus\": they do not feel that they can control their fate, ” considers Lev Gudkov as a sociologist, director of the independent Levada Centre.
Nikolai Korosov, historian of the University of Saint Petersburg, goes even further than this: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, “Putyin went back to the Paternism model, which was perfect for the people. Ananal, as this new type of Paternalism was not accompanied by a determation but by certain economic prosperity, ” says Maria Lipman, a colleague of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “reject personal responsibility from their own hand, ” which was quickly shown after the fall of the Soviet Union.
\"Why should we think about it?\"
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of individual Russia are led by 65 governors from the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often involves chaos, as has happened in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cseredniki, a 54 - year - old teacher, concluded: “Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, why should we replace them, ”
Pressive memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of 17 and half million victims of the Hitlerian regime.
The 47 million archives document, covering 27 kilometres of polcsor in Bad Arolsen, Hessen, had so far been researched only for humanitarian purposes, i.e. only for unique and name-specific victims or descendants of Hajdan.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, who manage the library agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After each state ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen Library enables historians to carry out research, to “report those imprisoned, to the residents of the camps and to explain to them the state of health of forced labour, ” explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of documents, since they also contain names and therefore confidential information.
For example, it may be the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some vulnerable victims.
The list of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to search civilians who were deported or judged as forced labour on the basis of these, and possibly serve with evidence of their interndition, which would be liable for damages.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in processing tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not see the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive as outstanding.
\"These documents basically contain nothing new,\" said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semiticism at the University of Berlin in 2006.
The EU-India Free Trade Agreement was signed in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching EUR 60 billion on an annual basis.
The EU's first trading partner in India and its external trade account for 18%.
The European Union and India hope that the Free Trade Agreement will be signed in 2008 - announced by the European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Minister of Trade Kamal Nath India.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers have already agreed that the European Commission will launch negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is now nearing EUR 60 billion.
The EU's first trading partner in India and its external trade account for 18%.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is the EU's 9th most important trading partner according to the European Commission's figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that “a free trade agreement could have an economic recovery effect for both parties, and “India could thus increase its presence in a flowering market with 450 million inhabitants ”
The 10 most important products exported by India have been identified by the European Commissioner for Primary and Secondary Imports. Every year, the two giants, Europe and Asia share a total potential of €47 billion – and €10 billion – each other has been replaced by Danièle Smadja, Head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi. However, he expressed his regret that bilateral trade – still has not achieved its full potential – the President of the EU and India will meet on Friday, New Delhi in the framework of the eighth diplomatic summit in Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, the President of the European Commission.

Answer the concerns: The Bank of England offers 10 billion pounds to the money market for five weeks.
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the concern about the credit conditions, so it announced on Thursday that it would pump 10 billion pounds of English pounds on the money market, which would be made available in a five-week period, unlike the usual one, with a 5-7% base interest rate.
\"We wish to remove concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would also like banks to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period; therefore, the Bank will offer a significant part of its reserves in the context of an open market operation in the framework of a five-week open market operation on the international money market,\" says the bank press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) are put on the market on the market on December 6, local time at 12:15 p.m. The tender is valid for the underlying bank and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England will issue liquid funds for five weeks in the framework of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In its press release, the Bank of England added that it was “ready to take further measures in order to adapt interbank loans to the central bank interest rate.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: at present, it stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer money market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant criminal interest rate on the money market, preventing banks from taking advantage of their use.
According to the rumor, many people would be more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have obtained with more favourable interest and greater discretion.
The MP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UPMP and Nouveau Centre group closed on Thursday to discuss articles of socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
The text negotiated at the meeting initiated by the Socialists included about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Social Party Office, including, for example, a 50% increase in employment replacements, the recovery of variable fuel taxes, the introduction of travel cheques and the restriction of rental charges.
Since he voted against the examination of the articles in the UMP and the NC 180:115 ratios, the discussion of the Government Party and the opposition finally broke off, only a few hours before the television speech on President Sarkozy's purchasing power.
The Head of the Socialist Delegation, Jean-Marc Aylault, announced that his group would resubmit all its proposals in the context of the amendment of the corrective draft financial legislation, which would be on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
New Festival Born
A number of rumors about the new Philadelphia Music Festival to be held by C3 Present. However, the organization and promotion company of the event announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in collaboration with Melvin Benn's British producer, Festival Republic.
“It is an honour for us to be able to work with people who are launching today’s American festival movement, ” said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 also organises the Lolapalooza Festival of Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey will be held in summer, so there will be a way for tenting.
The festival will be held in a 500 acres private area about 40 minutes from Philadelphia between 8 and 10 August.
Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's greatest honorable festival organisers.
In 1989 he started organising with the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80 000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn continued to expand his range with the organisation of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, he invited the Latitude Festival to live in the Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival production, licensing and organisation tasks. This festival has been able to receive up to 177 500 people by now.
The C3 team, Charlie Jones, named the Glastonbury Festival “the most inspiring event he ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn are working parallel to making the region rich with a European-style festival.
“We’ve already selected the philadelphia site, and together with the Fairmount Parks Committee, we worked hard to improve this festival in the centre of Philadelphia, ” said Charlie Jones.
“We continued to negotiate with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, because of the political maneuvers of the city management, the organization failed, Charlie Jones continued.
“We knew how to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and we are now preparing a huge festival at another unique location, which ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia.
The C3 Presents re-entered the Lollapalooza festival at Grant Park in Chicago in 2005, after having proven their exceptional talents with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars.
Both festivals were held at urban sites.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on a rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, thereby creating a European rural mood and a common sense of city life in America.
Vineland is located about half-way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland’s population and even the mayor’s own support for the event are very much supported, ” says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not speak about the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favourable enough to enable such an event to be invested in a venue that hopefully gives home for a long time to the festival ”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will have a huge capacity of about 80 000 people at the Bonnaro Music Festival in Cannes.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will basically be a rock festival, but we are planning a variety of musical offers so that everyone can find a place to like it, ” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Att, are together with the C3 company, which received recognition from the latest Billboard Touring Award.
Montreal is facing the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator...
The temptation is one of the tasks of the montreali.
The mission is politically difficult, as the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is opposed to rolling his own production abroad.
I wonder if it's really hard to pick up the fight with the “Terminator Governor ”
“We have to be careful, because the film industry itself decides which is the best location for the film industry.
If you find Montreal in favor of terms, you'll go there.
Our task is to offer the best possible conditions, which will be decided upon, ” says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for the Festivals
But Denise Turcotte is now the most focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for Oscars has begun.
The goal is to present and promote more Québec films at every American film festival, be it Sundance Film Festival, either Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival. You must also strive to allow directors to hold hearings.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres received a favourable reception a few weeks ago at the Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, the Palm Springs International Festival will also be exhibited.
Shakespeare Hands with the Devil is also featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in Santa Monica.
Québec also represented himself with four short films and four toy films this month at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will it be the end of the year rally on the stock exchange? The experts' opinion will be shared by the \"subprime\" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are losing their hands and looking forward to the end of the year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will really happen.
According to Banif, “from a statistical point of view, the stock exchange is generally positive in December.
However, only statistical forecasts are not necessarily sound, and even in the current situation there is uncertainty about the market, at least in the short term.
Experts do not agree with the end of the year of the stock exchange, although it is stated that ‘the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this gives an opportunity to invest, as there are no alternatives with the guarantee, in particular the fixed yield, which has a negative impact on the return to quality securities, as long as in the short term.
For this reason, the stock exchange will be characterised more by lateral, not volatility-free movement, especially since the effect of the reduction in the Fed will not yet be known, the price of crude oil will be high and the inflationary tension will also be threatened.
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain agrees with this, i.e. it would also be risky to declare that there will be rally.
According to the expert, ‘the situation is generally not rose’.
The loss of Ibex is nearly 4 percent compared to the highest values recorded on 8 November when the index was closed at 15.945.7.
Despite all this, not all experts are so horrid.
According to Juan Solana, InterMoney's analyst, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16.000 points due to the reorganization of the wallets and to the normal pension fund.
However, the expert points out that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be shifted by the second week of December, after the long weekend of the Constitution's Firm.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, the Inversis Banco analyst, we are close to the technical level and can see a decline in the stock index, which may also rise depending on the news from the USA, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on what will be the securities aimed at achieving the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that “the line is now on the big securities, ”
The expert would put two large banks on the list and some construction companies on the list, with which the electrical sector would be very expensive by then.
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally can also be positive for the construction companies, if any, of course.
“The ACS has been trying to recover its positions for several months and we hope that the construction companies Ferrov and FCC will also follow this path, ” says the expert.
Cycle consumption will be the main component of the rest of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also function well, although in this area they are not too high in representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years only two times the December exchange rate has occurred.
The real year-end rally could be observed in 2003, when stock markets have come out of the crisis caused by the loss of technology bubbles.
This year, when Ibex adjusted 35 28,17 percent, a 6.68% jump was registered in December.
So it is still open to 2007 to be the fifth profit year (i.e. it shows an increase of 8,36% in Ibex since January) and whether the final rally could occur.
Banco Popular Español opens a drawer open from 200 Monday to Saturday for 12 hours
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change for the bank.
However, for other Spanish institutions, this is the first group, whose branches are constantly open until 20.30 p.m., and even on Saturday from 10 p.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it is planning to open its branches for extended opening, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's been making an agreement with the trade unions about closing 75 % of his accounts in exchange for an afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, since it will be decided on this basis whether they will join a more favourable open-ended initiative.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
In those places, I want to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The Bank wants to operate 200 branches across Spain for 18 months with the said opening, because it is not a new opening order but a new one, but a new one.
To this end, the institution modernises its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of customers on each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new kind of thinking of the nature of the branches, a more modern, colorful design.
The commercial bank manager, Ánge Rivera, points out that there is no need for a large investment in restructuring, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
Non-financial products will also be sold to branches where even traders who have been set up for SMEs.
Beneficiary Experiences
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in its three Madrid branches.
According to Ánge Rivero, experience was positive.
In Madrid, Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets, the choice was made, and Rivero found that the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2500 accounts.
Another 60 of Mundocredi's activities are called Mundocredi, specializing in immigrants, and also having a very favorable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax does not use the BBVA model in these units, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We do not want to create competition for our customers, ” points Rivero.
They agreed with Telefonica at the moment and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles its rival Antena 3 stock exchange value
\"We did it,\"
This sentence expressed satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the market by Paolo Vasile, a consultant from Telecinco, when it turned out that the TV broadcaster that he was driving doubled the value of Antena 3.
Yet, one of his delights was: “It’s just that it’s not because we got up more, but because we fell less, ” he said.
Even so, he placed great emphasis on the weak market “we fell less ”
Telecinco closed up by 2.54 percent yesterday.
This increase places the annual loss to 15,66 percent.
52 per cent of the company belongs to Mediaset, 13 per cent to Vocento, so the stock exchange value according to Bloomberg is EUR 4.488.88 million.
His rival Antena lost 1.52 percent yesterday and recorded 40.5 percent since January, making half of it worth 2.193.46 million yesterday.
The value of the other registered communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is considered to be comparable between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can meet on the same market, at what costs, and how this will turn out in terms of discretion.
The Telecinco announced last week that this year, he wanted to be a TV channel over 1 billion advertising revenues, said Guiseppe Tringali, Telecinco and Publiespaña, a senior consultant.
If the notified fact were to be realised, the TV channel would increase its revenues from advertising by 3.6 per cent in the financial year 2006 compared to 965.4 million recorded in the financial year.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (as it reached 734.4 million), while the net turnover of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors that led to Telecinco’s stock exchange rate is the high payout that has been maintained to date: in 2006, 100% of the profits of the company managed by the President of Alexandria Echevarría were distributed.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio may change after 33% of Endemol has been bought with the parent company, associated with Mediaset.
“We have a great deal of guarantee of minimum 50% payments, although we have always shared much more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, since 33 percent of Endemol have already made us feel welcome.
According to the analysts, the market is currently characterised by some loss.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced Telecinco's yield estimates by 4 and 7 percent in 2008.
According to their statement, the estimated increase in turnover in 2008 is falling from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
According to the same company forecasts, the profit of Antena 3 is reduced by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and by 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high level of taxation resulting from dividends and its long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favourable than Antena 3 (maintenance) due to its more attractive and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, underweight is proposed for the \"acquired risks\" (super-market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the takeover of MiFID in force on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary procedure - which today has been the end of the Congress vote approving the amendments of the Senate - the government has initiated a social dialogue on the law-based regulation so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups have consistently highlighted the efforts of representatives and senators to negotiate and conclude agreements that served to create the most favourable norm to protect investors and to regulate the activities of companies in detail in order to ensure efficient market functioning.
Mifid, which amends the Securities and Markets Law, will allow the modernisation of money markets, while at the same time strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities and Markets Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new approach will allow financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also natural or legal persons, as well as to securities distribution companies, securities agents and portfolio management companies, to establish a new form of financial service providers (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the execution of financial operations, thus adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems that compete with current stock exchanges.
Furthermore, the Law requires investment service providers to be informed about the essential aspects, risk-taking and risk management of their business profiles and to keep a register of all operations carried out to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Congress Committee on Economic Affairs has tabled a number of amendments, which are of great importance to the fact that securitisations are treated as a \"combined instrument\" because of the high risk to the investor, which has been proven to be a high-risk American mortgage credit (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the Directive was also used to legalise the scope of the activity of those with economic and entrepreneurship qualifications, which was 30 years after the Royal Decree setting out the professional functions only applicable to the public authorities in 1977.
The Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the intermediary who works for another account, does not need the authorisation of the CNMV, and at the same time may market products or acquire customers for more investors.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data comparable to that of the United States, both in terms of the time and nature of their emergence.
The method of calculation for the preliminary indicator is the same as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modeling method differs from the assessment of information that is not yet available at the moment of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator was purely indicative and could therefore be different from the final data published on 14 December.
\"The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value –
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Government and the Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4,1 % in November was only of a ‘temporary nature’ but, at the same time, indicated that the price index would be expected to show a ‘high’ value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Mr Solbes confirmed that, although the indicator is not very positive, the inflation rate in Spain remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also added that the November month brought “less surprises ” than the previous month, when the Government did not account for such a great increase.
\"We expected a value of around 4 %,\" said the Minister of Economic Affairs, who published data during today's period.
Northern Rock wants 42 billion euros over the three years of Virginia.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently only £12 billion (16 billion €800 million) since he was in crisis in mid-September and had to raise urgent loans from the English National Bank.
At that time, he still had a record deposit of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to a loss of confidence in customers, despite the government's promise of 100 percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virginia will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name, called Virginia Money. Virginia will have to earn about one quarter of the British banks' revenues in the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds and reach the 30 billion targets.
Richard Branson's group of high-profile businessmans in England has become aware of the campaign of advertising that will spend around 50 million pounds (i.e. 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing so that it can reach the target.

Mayor of Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case
The Peacekeeper arrested the mayor of the City of Totana (The People's Party) in Murcia at dawn because they suspect that he was involved in the urban corruption scandal that broke out this week.
Besides, they arrested one of the city hall's secretaries and the city's chief of police.
The former town representative, Mr José Martínez Andreo, took over Juan Morales, a representative of the People's Party in May, who, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, could be the head of the corruption network.
The police are further investigating the city's offices, as well as the City Development Council, and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect of the corruption scandal this week.
According to the information from the SER radio station, Juan Morales of the People's Party was arrested when he left Morales in his bag with the documentation on corruption.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing a city development agreement with a Galician construction company on the re-securitisation of 200 hectares of land.
Currently, there are eight people under arrest.
Mr Bono will accept the nomination of PSOE in Toledo and the Parliamentary President if they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's offer to lead the list of PSOE to the next parliamentary elections and fill the parliamentary office if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the POSOE Secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party's federal center this afternoon following a meeting with Zapatero at noon.
The Prime Minister justified his election to the former minister that “we have to account for the best in politics, and Bono is among the best. ”
In addition, he added that, probably, the Socialist Party in Mancha will be nominated for the President of Parliament if the Socialists win during the forthcoming elections.
Bono would take over the place of President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he was not intending to enter the next elections and to give up his political career, rather in scientific circles, to fight against climate change.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister was constantly omitting to return to politics since he left active politics two years ago.
He also added that since the voters are aware of who will be the Vice-President in the event of the socialist victory, the party in the term of \"observability\" would also have liked to inform them who will be the President of Parliament.
If it were really Bono to fill in, Parliament would like it to be “responsible and not the scene of insult or screaming, ” and it would be more like the home of citizens.
Unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid, where it is not possible to speak freely, since the Prime Minister's speech was suspended 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he showed the current president Manuel Marín, “a fine job of his work, ” but he did not want to be announced as President-in-Office, so that his opponents would not ‘ be considered a dominant one. ’
A campaign for the climate
Since the movement of climate change is unscrupulously pursuing both sceptical behaviour against their forecasts and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
In fact, you must put on your side a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero, who says that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declares that \"we must conclude a new agreement with our Earth\".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the government’s activity or inactivity contributed to Spain’s presence in the EU in the non-compliance of the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why did the Government not seek to avoid this?
It should also explain clearly what measures it intends to take to control climate change.
What are the companies that will be affected, the population's habits to change, what individual and social energy saving should we expect and what economic consequences will be?
So who's gonna have to sacrifice it and who's gonna have to pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get an explanation, and we won't even get an explanation of these questions.
Exactly because it's sacrifice and money.
Climate change has always taken measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the public.
Even PSOE’s gas sales would have meant a lack of popularity before the elections, that Zapatero quickly withdrawn it.
That means the Earth must be saved with mere propaganda texts, with empty password free of actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new posts.
The agreement with Earth is made, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so well in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, does not even destroy election meetings and makes us awake.

One of your colleagues informs us that the Penal Code contains a violation of Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered a mistake and can be punished for one year from six months.
However, if you steal records of less than EUR 400 in a shop, it is a violation (Article 623.1ly).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, theft is already a sin, but your penalty is still not good enough for the amount of fines imposed on you when you download the Internet (Art. 234 of the CRD).
C. If you steal a car, but return in 40 hours, the penalty will still not reach the level of penalties imposed in case of online download (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than you copy CDs.
If you are involved in a mass struggle, you can receive a penalty from three months to one year (Art. 154 of the BTKK), but a penalty of six months to two years for copy CDs.
(BKK, Art. 270)
According to article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. Marketing of copyright-protected films is more difficult to punish without the consent of authors than selling pornography materials to minors (Article 186).

My doctor gave me an article about strange research: “The money causes brain activity, especially if the others have fewer.
So the feelings of the workers depend on how much the others received on the day of payment.
The experiment was carried out by the Tomography of magnetic resonants at the University of Bonnie, and the results were published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the director of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, of the Neurocognity group: “The strongest activity was measured when the participant responded correctly, but his partner made a mistake –
Researchers found that if they both received the right answer and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, activity was strengthened.
I have no idea why such a simple conclusion had to be so great.
The Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been abhorring the Balkan war criminals in the Hague for eight years and from the Prosecutor's office investigating crimes in the area of former Yugoslavia.
The mandate is down at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste, as the responsibles of rebrenica's bloodshed, during which 8000 Bosnian Muslims have been slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and the Serbian leader Radován Karadsich are still on the loose.
Their name is on the list that the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach chose as his documentary title: Carla's list (2006, Spain has not yet been presented). Like the true crisis, the film follows the work of the Swiss attorney from Belgrade to New York, as he tries to put pressure on the governments concerned to impose loops around the refugees.
What kind of insurance is my insurance?
Car insurance, which is a safety issue for car owners and also depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of acquisition of a license, family status, type of car to be guaranteed and the nature of its use.
Buying the car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often harder than deciding what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company is liable for compensation in the form of fixed premiums in the event of a loss.
The insurance premium is practically the amount paid for insurance, determined by taking account of various factors, such as age, gender, date of acquisition of a license, family status, type of car to be guaranteed, its use and so on.
Insurance companies set the insurance fee on the basis of the statistics, i.e. they pay a higher amount than those representing a higher risk of accidents.
That's why they're over 25 years old or women pay less because statistics say they're lower risk because they're more careful.
Similarly, on the basis of the statements, insurance companies have concluded that married people are causing fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency for the car type is the pivotal.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
Insurance companies take a number of factors into account when establishing the insurance premium.
Therefore, the owner must carefully review his profile to select the most appropriate form of insurance.
In the following, we present the main factors of choice so that the guaranteed needs can be best adjusted and acceptable prices developed.
At the time of the conclusion of the insurance contract, under the age of 25 people have a number of disadvantages, such as the lack of driving experience and the freshness of the driver's license.
Although the most ideal, if we are protected from all threats, there are more economical solutions.
The more cautious drivers can make a complete insurance with confidence, thereby ensuring against all threats and making the price affordable.
For this type of contract, the insured person pays part of the damage.
“The amount of own funds to be paid by the insured person depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the self-financing, ” says Luis Noguera, the manager of First Europa in Spain, the online insurance intermediary.
Another option is liability insurance extended to third parties when the client guarantees himself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, it will be secured against theft, fire department and car loss.
A good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible because this affects the bonus and thus reduces the amount to be paid in the future.
Discounts granted in relation to the basic tariff for the insurance company are known as Bonus.
And we call the fined penalty for the base price a pig.
‘The amount of the bonus and the balance sheet depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If it was a good year for the company, you can allow yourself to increase the level of the bonus, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year age limit has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to make adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
That's when we advise you to make a complete insurance policy.
“In recent times, young people are not able to properly apply their experience in one accident or even in driving, ” says the director of the European Insurance Company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur during the second year of driving, when drivers have gone beyond fear of starters.
If the insured person is already married, but has no children, it is best to have a complete insurance policy, of course, if his financial options allow it.
Insurance companies are keeping married couples with the lowest risk to customers, so in their case the price to be paid is also lower.
In this case, the best thing is complete insurance by self-employed (you can reach 300 euros) or if you have a higher bonus, you can extend insurance to the damage caused to others from the third year of the vehicle.
\"They drive more calmly, but they have greater customer power and can allow themselves to be higher self-inflicted,\" Luis Noguera confirms.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend a complete insurance with confidence (around EUR 150) or, in the case of a higher bonus, an extension to liability insurance.
Motor insurance is a very important thing, not only because it means protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it means a great deal of expenditure, it is therefore essential to choose the appropriate form of insurance for the person.
Celtic wants to get a score in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic are measuring their strengths in the San Siro stadium to get the missing point when the League of Champions is closed. Italians can be the first to be qualified and Scottishs can qualify.
The Italians have ten points in total, and in the fifth round, they have guaranteed progress with a tie in Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but there's one more thing to do, Shakhtar, who's going to fight with Benfica four points.
The two games of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play at the Club World Championship in Japan, where he will try to fight for the 16th finals on the 13th anniversary.
With this, Group D will close earlier than the others, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be the tie, the two teams will strive for victory, because the Italians do not want to miss home, while Celt can first start at a better place in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan's team has even lost enough to qualify for it if Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be certain, because if there's even equality, the Ukrainians will get on with the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night of the Scots miserable, who would like to join twice in the eighth finals of the United Nations League of Champions once there in the previous season a goal was released from the Kaka in the 0-0 post-commendation (1-0).
The “Rosserik ” victory Shakhtar would be most happy because if he loses the Celic will be in the eight-finals and stayed in the UEFA.
Since Benfica is currently in the last place and is in a position to remain in the European Championship, you can still get the third place with a victory that you can play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to participate in the first concert of the Spike Girls tour.
Spike Girls in Vancouver (Canada) started its tour, the first time they had appeared before 20,000 viewers since they broke up in 2000.

Some 20,000 people changed tickets to be there at the concert, where a video film was also presented in the 1990s with huge successes in the history of the band.
At the same time, the EMI launched a new album on the market in Spain, including the bigger hits and the two new songs, Headlines and Voodoo.
The five members of Spike Girls went to stage on stage with the British footballist David Beckham, the husband of Posh Spike.
The athlete was also on the scene until GM Place squealed, although he was banned by Victoria a few days earlier.
During the presentation, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star “he didn’t see our dress, so I’m nervous about what she would think of the performance, ”
'Sporty Spike', was the reason why the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 'cause the members didn't understand each other. He also seemed nervous at the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
“I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people felt the feelings they felt about Spike Girls have changed.
Now I am glad to have decided, ” Chisholm said about the group that divided nine years ago.
The singer also added that during time, “the things have been arranged and we love each other very much ”
But there's been a lot of things going on since Spike Girls last played in 1998.

More fears about the Russian-Ukraine gas dispute
The gas price has been renewed between Ukraine and Russia, which could affect Russian fuel to be delivered to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations are always of great importance.
Kiev stated that if Moscow raised the price of gas to be paid by the Ukrainians, they would also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, supply to EU countries has decreased.
The most recent debate between Kiev and Moscow on the attempts of the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom to agree on the level of gas prices paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that a 50% increase in gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan was to be made in comparison to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to the analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of shipments from Gazprom to Ukraine.
“It is important that during the negotiations we should argue to one of the most important transit countries for natural gas, ” said Anatolij Kinah, Ukrainian Minister for Economic Affairs of Reuters.
\"At all, changes in gas prices should be linked to our debate on the scale of the costs of transits to Ukraine (and to Western Europe) -
As a result of the recent significant gas price between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas pipeline to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has resulted in a dominant fall in exports to Western Europe, which has also significantly increased prices.
A quarter of the European Union's gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the largest reserves of natural gas in the world, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own gas supply by natural gas from the former Soviet countries of Turkmenistan and other Central Asia.
NHS is obliged to check foreign workers –
The Committees of the Scottish NHS must improve the monitoring of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe - a supervisory body has stated.
The proposal led to the presentation of a foreign-country doctor in Scotland following the attack on the airport in Glagow in June.
Black also expressed its concern about the lack of accurate data on NHS Scotland's employee numbers overseas.
At the same time, in its report - through the five samples of health authorities - it also pointed to key controls that have been carried out properly.
Following an attack on the airport in Glagow, the chief accounting officer checked the list of staff deployed outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullahot, an Iraqi doctor from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a Jap hit the main terminal in the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey court through a video link in October in charge of attempted bomb attacks in the UK.
The NHS Committees shall, in the case of employees from overseas countries, verify the existence of the qualifications and working experience of the workers concerned before starting employment and their availability in the United Kingdom with the permits for employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees are using Disclosure Scotland to check the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain information of this kind originating outside the Great Britain area.
Among other things, the report of the accounting officer has proposed that committees introduce guidelines from the Criminal Register Office, which facilitates the monitoring processes with the various overseas countries for the employer.
“Although we have found evidence of such checks among the staff records, they are not regularly carried out, ” says the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own investigation procedure prior to employment at a high level, adding: “Our report highlights the areas that can be developed so as to provide up-to-date information on NHS’s overseas personnel’s presence.
According to Dr. Peter Terry, the president of the BMA Scotland, “it is extremely unrealised that pre-employment checks will enable us to identify potential NHS staff who will be able to carry out terrorist acts in the future.
“The report adds that pre-employment checks are working well in the NHS Scotland and that the value of the proposals has not yet been transparent.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of employees from doctors and nurses in most of them is 1161.
However, the accounting officer pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, partly due to the problem for committees of identifying workers on an indefinite leave.
The investigation has also shown that the control procedures in the Ayrshire and Arin, the Grampian, the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, the employment permit and the evidence of professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the NHS Directive and guidance for checks on workers from overseas countries prior to employment.
Nicola Sturgeon’s health secretary said: “It was very pleased to see that this task was carried out after the attack on the airport in Glagow.
It added that, in cooperation with the Health Committees, the Scottish Government will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the updated version is published in the next month, the updated version of the updated pre-employment guidelines, including those from overseas.

208 people in Saudi Arabia have been arrested for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militans involved in terrorist cells were arrested, designed to carry out an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as more attacks on religious and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one cell tried to smuggle missiles.
The Al-Qaida supporters launched a campaign against the Monarchia, which has been active as an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
According to television reports, an eight-person cell led by a foreign citizen is intended to launch an attack on an oil plant in the Eastern Province.
Following an attack attempt by Al-Qaida in 2006 against the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqiq, Saudi Arabia has begun to build a rapid response force of 35 000 to protect the facilities.
According to the report from the Minister of Home Affairs, 18 of the arrestees belong to a cell that is led by a person specialising in violently crossing the border.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the Kingdom territory.
On 22 of them, plans were made to commit attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government called for a tougher action against the Taliban leaders in Iraq, who are joining the Al-Qaida warriors, who are fighting against the federal forces and the American-backed ski Muslim government.
The soldiers of Al-Qaida are considered to be a significant part of the Church leaders in Saudi Arabia by the authorities involved in the support of the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
Fighters of the organization - encouraged by the attack on foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, from his call for the target of the Western-friendly Saudi government.
“The security forces have made a huge effort in the last five months, ” said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Home Affairs to public television.
During the arrests, Medina also caught a 16 - person media cell whose goal was to spread “takfiri thought.Takfiri thought is the ideology of the sulnita Muslim radicals, which supports the violent action against the unfaithful andpostate Muslims.
Among those arrested were 32 persons accused of financial support from the militia.
The climate of Venus can provide an insight into the future of the Earth
Scientists found that Venus could once provide pleasant living conditions.
The data of a European orbiting spaceship suggests that this planet is much more considered the Earth's sedentary twin than we thought before.
Venus is Earth's nearest planet issue.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbits are similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, millions of years ago, there could have been very similar living conditions on Venus to Earth, and even housing relationships could have been given.
However, due to the subdued high carbon glasshouse effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by sunlight and the lower rotation rate of the planet, Venus has moved into a different developmental path in a hole.
Today the water is evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of Venus Express, based on a study of the planet for a year, provide an elucidating picture of how similar disastrous climate changes can develop on Earth as well.
Fred Taylor, professor at the Physics Department of Oxford University, who is also the leader of the Venus Express mission, reported: “Make sure that the climate of Venus is so much different from that of Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar.
“Our new data enabled us to develop a script about the emergence of Venus’s millenniums earlier when they had living conditions similar to the Earth.
\"Produced uranium\" arrested by police
A kilo of radioactive material - the reported uranium - was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether or not it was uranium, but claimed that the material would have been sold for $1 million (480 000).
Covered gates
According to Mitt Romney, it is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republicarian candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters put their questions on video and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the questions left on Wednesday night of November 28 proved to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on the other party on YouTube.
However, these questions and answers reflect the situation of the Republican party approaching next year's election.
The production managers of CNN co-financing the debate are not known for the time being, on the basis of what they selected YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue in the first half of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of Republicans' wedding parrots.
CNN has asked some uncertain voters to make a phone call if they have heard a question about the border: the intermediary experienced a strong agreement when the candidates spoke hard about the issue of borders.
The liveliest and longest debate was held between Rudy Giulian at national level and Romney, a pre-breaking perspective in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giulian is trying to change the image of him that he has dealt with the issue of illegal immigration too lightly during his mayor in New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The war between them became particularly intense when people were interested in supporting \"amnestia\" (which would provide permanent status and citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes - such as Duncan Hunter's Californian and Tom Tancredo'scolored representatives - have been able to go into the subject in depth.
And although none of them are likely to be on the mark, their remaining on the track may be explained by the fact that they started to congested the bell on immigration sooner and more loud than the others.
At least in the area of immigration there is broad agreement among candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to act hard against illegal immigrants.
This issue, like fear of Chinese toxic games and other worrying factors from the outside world, helps the Republicans to absorb or minimise the distribution between the liberals and the Christian conservatives within the Berkes.
However, when topics of a different nature have been brought forward, the debate has been very unpleasant.
Giulian had to face the question of why he supported the arms control earlier.
John McCain and Romney debated whether the simulation was torture.
Another questionr was wondering if candidates would believe all of the Bible’s words.
In this area, Giuliani finally got to the point where she looked at the Bible as her favorite book, and she might not literally interpret the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was the first place in the Iowa elections that had just come to this - who had been able to win because of Christian conservatism - responded to expectations that death punishment was painful, but needed.
When they expressed concern as to whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, laughing at Jesus ’ wisdom was more wise than to go in the elections.
Competition continues to be unusually open.
Huckabee's momentum in iowa coincides with the action of the Liberal Ron Paul and the keen support of the Wednesday dispute.
The sudden break-up of the two candidates is explained by the fact that the two sides of the party have not yet been a common candidate among the aspirins representing better known and more traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party in time and with conviction for the winning message of America's size and found the voice in common with both sides of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and its consequences are not yet obvious.
Working party pain
Another gap before Gordon Brown; the way out unaltered
Compared to the British political scandals, it does not seem too far-fetched.
No one sold his honor, no politician was found in Paris' hotel accounts, no one committed a scandal outside of marriage.
But discovering that a wealthy businessman, under the name of others, has spent over four years contributing a sum of £650,000 ($1.3 million) to the Labour Party in the Governor of Great Britain, and that this party has not reported any of the things without which the circumspected Gordon Brown would have been well found.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with the election, and when he expressed his statement - that the opinion polls did not affect the outcome of the decision - and thoughtlessly questioned the intellectual ability of the British, people were still hoping Brown would ensure a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the vice-president of the Liberal Democrats noted, who had become Mr Bean, once feared, became Mr. Bean.
The failure to save a penitentiary bank called Northern Rock has crucified regulatory weaknesses and judgmental shortcomings.
The patient proposals for amending the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to bring together the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authorities revealed an unpredictably high level of administrative failure.
In the House of Lords, three quiet generals gave a demonstration against the reduction of the military budget, claiming that the position of the Minister of Defence is part-time work.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious contributions; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labour Party (former Administrative Director) has resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where governance is impossible.
People don't like politicians and they don't even trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
As it becomes clear, however, that the Prime Minister is very unlikely to be able to advance things and perhaps not stay on his post for a long time, the end of the suspended disbelief: the civil servant arm begins to leak out, the cabinet ministers are going to make adjustments, the press looks after bad mouth news; the government will start to defend itself and will not be able to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, as unlike other political leaders, he does not count as “fresh blood. ”
As much as you want to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, you still had your right hand.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax authorities records, for example, are linked to decisions made during Brown's Finance Department.
And although Blair's failure, such as the long-term examination of the relationship between money and political party funding, has not been directly involved, voters may have the right to assume that it is the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is really unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The gunshots that were committed are not as scary as those that the throats indicate.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
The compensation, however painful it may be, can be the creation of promised orientations by Stalin Brown: reliable, firm and slightly hard-handed governance.
For example, it serves as a fidelity around political donation.
The cellular Abrahams, who compares his gift to charity, claimed that he did not want to spread his favour to the public.
Perhaps so, however, making the decision was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the anonymisation of large political supporters is clear and clear: the population has the right to know who knocks on the door of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his statement, knew about Abrahams' measure, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweating during the interrogations; just as Jon Medleson, founder of the Labour Party, who was informed in October of the confusing donations.
To Brown, however, for now, there are no leads: there is no indication that he knew about these tours, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, half of the Prime Minister's duties have been met.
However, he quickly condemned the infringement by his party, but his firmness was glad that he had extended to a known device; he had appointed a committee under the leadership of a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case, in the interests of security.
In this story, “the lesson to be learned ” is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation, the police are competent.
Brown also needs to take other things into account, such as the appointment of the President of an independent committee negotiating administrative rules six months ago or the need for effective reform of political party funding.
This would require a hard-fishing Labour Party to cooperate with stories and break up with special financial relations with associations - this would be a tough wall for the partner Brown.
But you should face some of the party-related facts.
According to surveys, the Conservatives have a serious advantage at the moment; Brown has two years to win the voters back behind him; the only way to make the win is the impenetrable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Does the second market mortgage credit crisis threaten America's credit card market?
If blood comes into the water, it's natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is failing, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage credit crisis also infects other forms of retail loans, the credit card market's loss could reach up to 99 billion dollars.
The tensions are clearly visible.
Both the figures for the rate of interest rate and the default rate for late payments beyond 30 days have increased.
The HSBC reported a loss of USD 1.4 billion last month in the US consumption finance segment, partly because of the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is still early.
The ratio of descriptions to late payments remains low.
The late payment rate of 3,89% by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is a percentage lower than the historical average.
The decrease in prices can be explained in part by technical factors.
The change in the U.S. rules of individual insolvency has resulted in a sudden decline in the number of insolvency reporting agents, but has caused a large loss in the credit card market; a new increase in the number of bankruptcy claims (and thus the description ratio) is expected, whether or not the total of the terms and conditions for borrowing are impaired.
The payment rate, which reflects the monthly credit repayment rate of consumers, is also stable on the market.
Furthermore, trust in credit cards is also rather strong, despite the deterioration in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at the TowerGroup research firm estimates that 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
The effects of the mortgage market crisis are clear for the credit card market: consumers increase debt on credit cards to pay housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers mainly monitor cash flow and not asset value, so the fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation that has arisen may be beneficial to creditors.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage, consumers will be encouraged to pay off the credit; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will be a priority priority.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt more quickly and more efficiently to changing conditions than mortgage creditors.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of the sudden flooding of assets.
“It’s unlikely that one day we’ll wake up fully reassessing the loans, ” says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
If a subprime sudden crisis on the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual downturn is much more likely.
If the decreasing housing market prices and the decline in lending lead America into a recession, the industry will undoubtedly look forward to a big future.
It's worth watching those predators.
British bankers declared themselves guilty of the Enron case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought to justice by Enron's former financial director, Andrew Faston, for the purpose of investigating their role as a fraud.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially declared innocent in the charge of the seven-time fraud, which is believed to have cooperated with Fastow in a secret fraud in the year 2000, which they wanted to gain at the expense of their employer.
Their trial started in January.
But at a court hearing, before Ewing Werlein Jr., all of them admitted their guilt in a single-time fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Greenwich NatWest have become known during the two-year extradition process in Great Britain.
The closure of the investigation after the collapse of Enron in 2001 in the United States is still waiting for you.
The first prosecution against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
According to the charges against them, the three brokers baptized “NatWest Three” went to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare fraud with Fastow and Michael Copper as the right hand of Fastow then.
Fastow, responsible for designing numerous fraud in Enron, also controlled Enron’s subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank did not know about any of its existing shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew that the interest was very high.
A company managed by Copper bought the bank a share of $1 million in the subsidiary.
Bankers paid Copper $250,000 to raise a stake in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow informed Enron that the energy company was buying the 20 million dollar subsidiary shares from Greenwich NatWest.
But actually, $20 million hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution believes that the bankers reached $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others reached $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow declared her two-fold guilt over the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow currently holds six years' sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
It's three years for the Kopper and a month's sentence in a prison in Texas.
The three English men were able to travel to the United States with $1 million bail per head while they were sued.
Enron, the seventh largest U.S. company, reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks applied over the years could no longer cover the millions accumulated as debt and the profitable, but actually loss-making companies.
The collapse has led to the loss of jobs, the market value has decreased by more than $60 billion, and the value of pension funds has decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former Director General Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted last year for their part in the company's bankruptcy.
Schilling is currently in prison for over 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges imposed on Lay ended with the death of the man last year.
No poverty in Moscow
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with Rolls-Royce engines will start without interrupting the trip between Moscow and Los Angeles.
But this amount is only a small amount for some Russian rich.
\"18 passengers were able to fit in,\" said Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
“No one has so many seats in it because they buy machines for private families or corporate leaders, ”
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day exclusive Milliomos Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury items deliverrs rented a stand at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian entrants will be interested in all, from mahogany-coated yachts to 50 cents of diamond refrigerators.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange Porsche on the side of the stand.
“It’s a nice car, but it’s not even worth our products, ” he said.
After the US, private aircraft have the largest market in Russia.
It seems that the Russian capital swims in money like Dallas did it during the time of the oil auction.
“We also went through a similar process in the 1890s when some Americans went to Europe, and these Americans were considered materialists here, ” said Marshall Goldman, the Senior Scholarship of the Davis Centre of Harvard University, Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Japanese gamblers of Saudi Arabia and the 1990s, Russians have now become the world's most prominent poets.
The most exclusive brands follow their share of the gold fever.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH shared his views on how to sell products of high value on markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times.)
According to the list of the richest people in Forbes, there are 53 billion people living in Russia with a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian Muslims reaches 103 thousand, who can account for a total of $670 billion, has established a study carried out by the public owners of the former Centre for Economic and Financial Research, which analyses the personal welfare development of the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank's data indicate that in 2005 the number of people living under the minimum was 15.8 per cent in Russia.)
“ A hundred million people live in Moscow, and that is why we are all here, ” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London’s David Morris jewelry store.
Nicole took part in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women all have gone through an impeccable path, and men are a real treasure mine, ”
In the rooms on Sunday evening, two real estate agents in the evening clothes, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, were both considered to be a millionaire.
“I watched the cars and tried to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche, ” said the young Yumatova, who had been in a tumultuously-edged, custom-made dress, as if he had been used to this exercise.
The fair was directed primarily for the registrars, for brand-oriented Russian buyers who, after hours, were willing to go around a watery, cifran-decorated venue where you can find Catillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mőnpick ice cream, regular bulliard tables, dubai apartments, and Gund-pants masks.
For average people the ticket costs 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best, ” said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotic with regard to the location of the Dutch china producer Royal Delft stand, compared with a copy of Rembrandt with a wall size, hand-painted blue change.
“The Russians are more interested in visible things, of course, ”
Indeed, the sellers here said that long-term Russians (based on Russian standards, this represents 10-15 years) have already been devoted from the expropriated logos to the Bagatell, limited copies that would not enter a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, were appointed by millions of millionaires, and tourists spent the room every day maiming.
And some of them bought it.
The first day of the show, on Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the King Koil Beds, told me that he sold two gold medals of silk, cashmere and cotton each day.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales agent of A1 Moto on the modern alarm for high-quality cars, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian million.
Andrei Karapetian, a luxury car manufacturer with unique needs, president of L.A. Connection, sold three refrigerants to Rolls-Royce Phantom by Sunday afternoon.
The reporters also presented a garden for the owner of a Russian casino, which he said was involved with Swarovski crystals to make the appearance of a roulette wheel.
Price of a set of four pieces: $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants a picture of his wife’s face from a circus cube is not necessarily going to use these items, ” Karapetian said.
“He'll keep them in the 30-40 car garage, ”
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are rich, Karapetaan says that the term “orus millalomous ” today is not a great privilege, given the sharp rise in real estate prices there.
“The guy who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is probably already a millionaire, if not in cash, but at least in paper, ” he said.
“ They’re more than you think ”
Those of you who are non-millionaires, at least could have created the appearance of wealth in front of the founder of the Russian trust company with Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style telephone booths, which were accumulated with millions of counterfeit dollar bankers.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager told me that his team printed 500 thousand false banknotes on the Milliomos Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped playing with money. Many took photos of themselves with a mobile phone as they were in the money ring, or just put a few million in pocket.
“See, everyone in Moscow can feel like a million people, ” Karryev said.
They're suspected of having a fatal accident in New Jersey.
It happened on the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked at the flat glass window of a restaurant called “only a little healthier” and saw a lifeboat stopping at Cape Cod with two doors down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car arrived shortly later.
Then another one.
“After that, I saw the doctor’s car stop, ” said Wednesday, Mr Livingston, one of the supervisors working at the restaurant.
“When I knew someone was dead, ”
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo. She worked earlier as the head of the director of the Newark Police Department.
There's currently an investigation to find out if death was caused by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon, not identified by the police, working under West Scott Avenue 212.
So far, the authorities have failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the Toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks' time, will light up this mysterious death that has affected the high-ranking staff of the Newark police with great pain.
Arroyo, whose voice has been known to many people in the department, has worked as an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
“It was loyal, urgent and reliable, ” he said about McCarthy Arroyo in a Wednesday interview on the phone.
“. He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector.
McCarthy told me that Mrs. Arroyo was currently married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer, currently working on the SSA, and he left two 14 and 11-year-old boys and a step-daughter.
Mr Walsh, prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, reported that the investigators were working on the discovery of whether Mrs. Arroyo was the victim of an unauthorised surgery.
“The probability is up, ” Walsh said.
\"The investigation is currently under way.
From the authorities' accounts, it turns out that November arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m.
On the 21st and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
They've already declared him dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and the police have been selling very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro was being heard from by the detectives.
In the study, participants are investigating whether part of the house is functioning as a medical clinic.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door in Castro's home, where a dreaded rosebok stood in the narrow front yard and a songtip was barking from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the basement, a blue container in the driveway was marked “Etil Vanilin, ” which is used to replace vanilla in foods and perfumes.
Turn from hooks to two mountain bike sides.
McCarthy recalled that after 25 years at the New York Police station, he first arrived in Newark, Mrs Arroyo, was an invaluable help by helping him to adjust to the unusual and unscrupulous political culture of the new city.
“ He always said, With this and with it, he’s better to look after, ” he recalls.
“He was always here when I arrived this morning, and he was still in there when I left at night.
It was embarrassing.
Expectations of the Fed’s interest rate reduction lead to the collapse of world stock markets
On both shores of the Atlantic Ocean, stock prices jumped yesterday, after the US Central Bank’s Deputy President’s reassuring statements have increased his hopes that the Fed will try to facilitate investment opportunities by further cutting interest rates.
Share markets both in London and in New York and across Europe were abandoned after Donald Kohn, who declared the head of the Fed President Ben Bernandke to be his better hand, the leaders must respond “sufferably and pragmaticly” to the constant unrest on financial markets.
In addition to the clear purpose of Kohn to reduce the markets in the midst of the signs of the resumption credit crisis, Kohn stated that the present unrest “in part has restored the development on the market at the end of September and in October –
He said that if increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions in households and companies.
The declarations were interpreted by investors as being prepared to inject fresh capital on American markets or even further interest rate reductions to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements have also restated on Wall Street, which has recently been receiving many bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of the number of American housing sales.
The financial anxiety effect was also confirmed by the announcement of the Bear Stearns Investment Bank that, in order to compensate for the loss in the US second-market mortgage sector, the cost reduction of 650 employees and 4 percent of its global labour force.
A total of 20 jobs are affected by the measure.
In New York, Dow Jones' industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The FTSE 100 index in London increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6.306.2, and increased the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 fonts.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The market failure in credit was renewed after the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank had been charged at a price of 4.7 per cent to the European banks, which had not been seen since April 2001 for three months.
After the interbank interest rate in English, Libor reached the highest value since September after a steady increase after 12 November, all the pressure on the Bank of England became more difficult to follow Fed and the ECB and to allow additional capital for the cash market in London.
They're following the decision in England between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who's got the English team in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in an indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, who makes the decision is no less important?
The latter question is on the one hand because David Graveney, the president of the electors, who temporarily performs this particular task, will assist coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughn in the decision.
Among the two players, the shortest one that won't get the sixth punch point, but as well as known, life and especially sports are often unfair.
It's never easy to tell us how to reach the top of someone's calling, while other people can't get past a lower level.
It is not only a criticism that is difficult to make - often subjective - selection.
Has the time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question could be raised in other areas of life, for example, when John Edwards and \"Tubby\" Banerjee were put in front of decision-makers, two young young people with excellent qualifications, who are well-known in the business, while only one of them has a place for him.
Who can tell us what level a croquette player is on without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, data has a major influence on the decision, but opportunities are equally important.
In a team, the player needs to catch the captain's look at it at the moment in the croquet hat, and a player needs to have a chance to become a big player on a regular basis.
The look of the pickers is much more complicated to catch.
More than James Anderson has played better in the past season, for example, but he still thinks he's a sure team member on the first test, even though Stephen Harmison's own words say he's in good shape and he's doing a good shot.
Anderson fought 32 first-class goal blows and 33 runs to take part in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but they both had successful moments at the highest level, and they hope that they'll be like this in the future.
If Shah or Bopara will play in Asgiriya Stadium, well, this will be decided on the basis of the opinions.
This decision may be averted or broken by anyone's career, but it may also have no particular impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played well in all the tests and carried out with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet Paul Collingwood, who was then emerging, became an outstanding and decisive test critic, who may still be underestimated even today, even though in Australia, has acquired double hundred points against the Australians.
It is possible that when listening to the conservative instincts of Graveney, Vaughn and Moores at their meeting in Asgiriya Stanion, Shah will take up their voks, against Bopara's young life force and dynamism.
I'm on both sides of the argument.
Next to Shah, he's a bright and successful decorating test in the districts of Bombay 88. He's seven years younger than the six-year-old Bopara, who also has an excellent screw, he's got 32 first-class hundreds.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player in Shah in May, the Lorda test, ran only ten in two quarters against West Indies, and that Vaughan, who fought for it again in the next game, faced immediate opposition to the selections, seems to have reduced the stamina that still seemed to be present in Bombay.
In contrast to him, the universal talent of the Essex is a life-giving and inexplicable player.
There's nothing to be upset about on the cruise track, but he described his behavior outside the field as well when he was involved in an exhibition with a four-wheel drive to the team's car sponsor, the Volkswagen.
Nevertheless, the first thing she did was get the phone of Vodafone (naturally sponsored) and he called his remote teammate Alastair Cook to ask him: “You saw this.
Bopara is a better court player with classics. It creates an advantage for its long-term steps, and its punches are confident and skilled.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe it's the real art of choosing.
Personally, I'd give Bopara a chance, which doesn't mean that I think Shah wouldn't give a high priority if, as the tea leaves in ceylon suggest, he'd be the one to play this weekend.
They're transporting the refugees home to work and fighting the Al-Qaida.
Since yesterday, they have arrived from Syria in the first buses with the Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or have expired their visa, or actually those who hope that the city has restored its order.
There are also those who have returned to fight with the soldiers who have taken them out of their house.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filled with dozens of buses.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Bagdad, ” said Dr. Sabah al-Qubasi.
“Today I returned because I saw what happened in Bagdad on TV and in the newspapers and that the city was safe now.
“It is said that the Mahdi army stopped killing people, ” he added, referring to Reverend Moqtada al-Sadr Milicista, who has now stopped his ski army.
Mostly the 38-year-old ski teacher from Amaryah, who lived in the saunas, Qassim al Atwani returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqis from doing their work.
Amarii’s ski neighbors called him and urged him to return, saying that the American-backed troops were able to cut Al-Qaida out of their rosary in the western part of the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a sauna and ski tribe leader who fled from a grenade attack from home in Sleikh in northernbagda, after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
“ Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had created an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed the support of my sons and mine.
That is why I returned today, ” said Sabaah Alu Obedi, 62 years old.
Many have talked about the fact that since the American troops took part in the capital, they have been lured home by armed civilian forces working with the American troops.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai voiced the refugees with the widespread view that Prime Minister Nouri al-Malikii asked the Syrian government to reject the refugees’ visa application to force their return.
They think that more than two and a half million people have escaped death squads in the country.
“It was all right until Al-Maliki's visit to Syria did not put pressure on the government not to issue more visas for Iraqis to move home, ” said the sunnit retired.
“I cannot trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I escaped ”
One of the reasons why the violence was reduced is that the saunas were removed from the ski areas, while the skis left the sunnite areas, resulting in a decrease in tension in many countries.
Many people are afraid that the sudden appearance of refugees will re-invigorate the customs, which can lead to more battles.
Small Saarlands - Curriculum
The smallest federal province plays a leading role in vocational training and has international orientation in higher education.
Only in one field of training are island regions struggling with the same deficit as the rest of the country.
“On the other day, 50 times, I explained to an outside country of Saar that we are not French, ” says the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province on the posters of this self-ironian slogen.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saarland education system, which can boast on the fifth place based on the IW surveys of the Kolni German Economic Institute.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, even because of traditions.
The University of Orphan was founded by the French in 1948.
Today, students can be closed with two degrees or even three.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent higher.
However, many of them do not have high school education, many of them also do not have upper secondary education.
“In the Saar region, the opportunities for vocational training are exploited, explains Axel Plynecke, an expert in education at the German Economic Institute.
Young people earn higher than a fifth vocational school with higher education rights than seven percent of the total federal average.
The combination of professional and higher education has also been well developed.
The infrastructure for double studies, given the number of the population, is located in second place in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing interest, the number of senior engineers has decreased in recent years by a third.
The Ministry of Education in the island has therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign whose focus is engineering.
“We have initiated a number of reforms in primary schools following the first Psa study, ” said a spokesperson at the Ministry of Education.
For this reason, the government has conducted comparative tests across the country.
To start learning early, the last school year is free of charge. It is a model which, in the meantime, began to copy into other federal provinces.
Only comparative studies in the future will respond to the continuous improvement of student performance.
Based on the Psa survey conducted in 2003, the proportion of students at risk was reduced from 29% to 20 percent.
However, overall, the performance of the land in Saar did not improve to the extent that other federal areas did.
Bajorans count better.
The greatest revenge of the islanders during the Psa survey will not be taken into account for the foreign language recognition - otherwise in this area they would otherwise be able to reap beans,
Because the language of neighbouring countries in high school is a mandatory object - even if the island people are not French.
Chávez transforms clocks
In Venezuela, hours are different from the rest of the world in the near future.
On December 9, the president of Hugo Chávez will turn back half an hour in Latin America.
Meanwhile, Chávez in Spain became an object of laughter.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela stated, according to a new law, the clocks are turned back four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
Anti-US Chávez has, among other things, justified his decision to force the entire hours-based time zones in the United States to the world.
Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia for a hostage.
The nationalist on the left stated that until the Conservative Alvaro Uri remains President of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian government will be in touch with the government.
“I can’t do this because of my own dignity, ” said Chávez, who called for a constitutional reform on which citizens of the country of oil should be given an opinion on Sunday in the context of a referendum.
It would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for this debate was Uribe’s decision to withdraw from Chávez’s mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe’s decision was “achul spit ” on Venezuela, giving his criticism of Chávez’s Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new mobile ring voice came out: “Por Qué no te callas ” (Why don’t you shut your mouth) - that is how more than half a million people spend themselves on the Internet.
The sentence originates from the king of Spain, King János Károly, who was so upset at the last Latin America Summit by the constant public appearances of the Baltic populist politician that he had cut into his voice.
In 2007, the Germans were threatened with wage cuts.
According to a forecast, real wage reductions threaten German workers this year despite a strong conjunctural trend.
Experts supported their pesticide forecast with a bunch of reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler-Apployee calculations, employees can actually account for less in 2007 than in the previous year.
“The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in the general turnover tax as well as the rapid rise in food and energy prices is, ” said Gustav Horn, the School for Macroeconomic and Conjunctural Research.
As far as unemployment insurance is concerned, there may also be additional burdens on workers.
In his statement to the ‘Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung’s Minister of Finance, Mr Peer Steinbrück stated that the reduction in the right and reasonable unemployment insurance at the beginning of the new year was 3.3%.
At all times, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply to the Union for credit or support, they quoted the German Socialist Party, the SPD politician.
It became known Tuesday that the price explosion of food and mineral products resulted in the highest inflation of 13 years of age.
In comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 per cent per year.
Venus is the devil's twin of the Earth.
Despite the strong atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than it has been assumed so far: in its atmosphere, it has discovered lightning discharges of the European \"Venus Express\" space probe, and on the polar slopes, as has been the case in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus will flash.
The European-Venus Express space probe provided evidence that electromagnetic waves were discovered at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus spread round from cloud to cloud at 56 kilometers, reporting the \"Nature-scientific magazine Hababin Christpher Rusel, a colleague from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the well - known theory, the creation of life on Earth was caused by lightning: According to the theory, the zivatars have initiated reactions in the ocean that led to the development of amine acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was a life there, it could have been very early, ” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, living organisms can barely exist on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth, and temperature levels sometimes reach 500 degrees.
“ It may be that Venus is the hell’s twin brother of the earth, but still his twin brother, ” Russel nailed it.
The main issue of the Esa mission is why Venus, in its mass and size, is going on a completely different path of development.
The launch of “Venus Express ” in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus investigation, because since the beginning of the 1990s no probe had been able to express itself on its way to explore this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results presented in several Articles of Nature are not only proof of its uniqueness within the Venus solar system.
“It is also pointed out that the familiarity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we assumed at first, ” said Esa.
Researchers discovered, along with the already known northern-sarcist swirl, an even more rapidly moving cloud vortex on the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds me of the air currents of the winter hemissphere of Earth, states the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spazaale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the second supreme planet of the solar system is almost the same as the Earth, and with its 12.100 kilometres of diameter, it is almost as sized as the Earth.
The heavenly body, also called the Evening Star, will avoid the sun in less than 225 days.
However, you will turn a much slower turn around your own axis: one Venus Day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although the 460 Celsius-phos surface temperature, combined with Venus 92 bar, hardly reminds the Earth, scientists are starting from the fact that both planets were born under completely similar conditions.
Both of them had water that remained as an ocean on Earth, while Venus went to the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth was bound in the carbon exchange, Venus is a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler is defending Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, President of the German Republic, demands the conclusion of a debate between parties about the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellorial office.
Indirectly, he was critical of the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
The German President of the Republic Horst Köhler is concerned about the German authority and has called on the large coalition to conclude a debate about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this question, we should not show ourselves as a divided nation to the outside world, ” said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding of the acceptance of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“ Human rights are universally valid to me, even if I respect the diversity between cultures, ” Köhler underlined.
Everyone is aware that Germany needs to balance its foreign policy and that the President-in-Office of the Republic stressed that Merkel would defend himself against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
“The Federal Chancellor did not break up with a traditional China policy.
China is also aware of this, ” he nailed Köhler.
In an indirect way, Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD) gave his voice over the reception of the Dalai Lama, and therefore became a target table for attacks in the EU.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about EU policy on foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the Cancellary Office, there were intense disturbances in the German-China relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership rejected not only the invitation of the German Minister of Finance of Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL's information, it also frozen the so-called Strategic Party between the Foreign Ministry of the two countries.
Wen Jiabao's Chinese Prime Minister has now called on Angela Merkel's Federal Chancellor to confess that there was a mistake in the reception of the Dalai Lama.
China rejects European politicians accepting the Tibetan religious leader in their official capacity, confirmed the Chinese position, Wen Jiabao.
The works and words of the Dalai Lama have shown that they are trying to break out of China the additional Tibetan territories that include Tibet and other today’s provinces.
The Schäuble protects from disturbances similar to those of the French people
Street collisions with the police, shootings, flaming cars: Mr Schäuble is protected from disturbance similar to the French people.
Everything must be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from falling into street violence, demands the Federal Minister of Home Affairs.
The barricades were on fire, the randoms shot the cops with a beer rifle: After the serious disturbance of the young people in France, the Federal Minister of Home Affairs (CDU) is afraid of similar developments in Germany.
“We need to be careful not to build up the social explosives at our disposal, nor to be forced into violence.
We must take this seriously, ” he said to the Neue Presse newspaper in Hanover.
Not all young people apply to rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to resolve problem cases, said Schäuble.
This affects not only the integration of immigrants.
\"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes already occur,
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that German suburbs have no urban and socio-economic problems such as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, young people fought serious street fights with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
In view of this, the Federal Government called for more activity in terms of integration, Kenan Kolat, the head of the German Turkish Communities.
In France, Kolat warned about the dangers of follow-up.
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
However, action is necessary.
Kolat referred to the fact that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families was higher than the average.
We should take care of more educational places first and foremost.
Kolat stressed: “We need to provide young people with a prudence –
However, the Turkish Community leader added that “social supervision within the family is more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: “We still have to be alert, ” he says.
For young people, \"the faster they need to ensure that they have a job and receive education,\"
Meanwhile, in Paris, at Villiers-le-Bel, there was total peace during the night.
Hundreds of policemen were ready to go in, and a helicopter was scouring the area with lights.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and a few burns and a car.
Since the reporting, a security unit of 1,000 people has taken care of peace.
The police are ready to take action as long as necessary to report to the Home Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after his visit to the city.
During the night on Tuesday, 80 policemen were wounded on round due to the shocks of the wilders-le-bel.
The next night the riots spread to Toulouse.
The revolutions have broken into a traffic accident during which two young people lost their lives Sunday.
The State Attorney General's first findings indicate that the police are not liable for the deaths of young people.
Cloudsaw in Angela's realm
The action of the Chancellor, which is stricken with reality, is proof that the coalition is going to end and that nothing is expected to happen.
Which country, in fact, does the Federal Chancellor live in?
It is necessary to conclude, in the light of its unfavorable and unspeakable action in the general debate of the Bundestag, that he does not live here in the country whose governance would be his concern.
He rejected Angela Merkel with a very ambitious sentence that he was too focused on foreign policy.
It's constitutional, it's answered, and in this way it's just saying that he doesn't want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how ingenious the mutilations are.
In the meantime, neither specific interest nor empathy could be felt in the country's problems.
Instead, Angela, who is a multifaceted politician who runs into foreign policy and has only the uncertainty of himself.
The example of climate protection: Heiligendamm praises himself unbridledly for his dealings, but listens to how the country should achieve its climatization goals.
In any case, as far as self-esteem is concerned, this level of modesty would not have been allowed by the CDU president two years earlier.
Now he's getting into that pharaoh that prosperity has a positive effect on humans.
By doing so, he is the cause of his good news as a pragmatic personality who, instead of the flowers, solves problems.
However, in Angela's empire, the problems of domestic politics are only secondary.
Child poverty and low income problems?
It's just a few semi-sparkling words.
There is a lot of talk about how frequent you are when it comes to family replacements.
Three times Merkel's got to stick around to get a semi-mix.
When it comes to specifics, it's in a foreign area.
An attack case class
During the debate of Republican presidential candidates on Youtube, the two favorites, Rudy Giulian and Mit Romney have been hit hard - and they have to keep one external candidate.
The tension of candidates has already surfaced on the first subject.
Mitt Romney to his opponent, Rudy Giulian, said that he made New York as “a rescue for illegal immigrants. ”
One who is experiencing serious facts on his own side: “I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants, ” he cuts back to Giulian, and the number of the former governor of the Massachusetts has been employed as a private person for immigrants without documents.
The candidates are under attack: As the Republican camp still has no uniform support for its favort, the eight presidents expect to use the debate on CNN first and foremost to undermine its opponent's credit.
30-second videos sent by Internet users through Youtube are barely more than short summary.
“ We put Hitler in power with this kind of isolationism, ” says John McCain, under his opponent Ron Paul’s nose, who is the only one of the participants in the circle demanding an immediate exit from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed on the Vietnam veteran when he chooses to condemn the so - called Waterboarding as torture, the interrogation method during which the flooding is simulated.
In the meantime, the important issues of the campaign are not only set aside for discussions on torture in Iraq and torture, but also the reactions of St. Petersburg, Florida's audience.
There is a loud touch in the room when the conservative values are praised and the future tax rises are rejected.
Meanwhile, the two candidates are increasingly showing weaknesses.
“I was wrong about that, ” he laments Romney and apologizes to his supporters and television viewers for putting the voksa down in 1994 for the interruption of pregnancy.
Giulian, however, is moved to seek his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governes as a civilian
One day after the military's reinstatement, Musharraf, exercising authority in Pakistan, was defeated.
This will put an end to eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's President, a further five-year suspension of his term of office.
Pakistani television was broadcast live from the capital, the President's Palace of Islam.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution, and to do the work of his people.
Wednesday's military leadership office was handed over to his trusty Ashfaq Kiyani, and so he allowed the international pressure from the United States ahead of all of them.
The former general now reigns as head of state for the first time, eight years after he broke into power in the form of a military coup d'état.
Musharraf, acting as Commander of the Armed Forces, has complied with a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important requirement is the abolition of the exceptional condition announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Chief Prosecutor-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will close the extraordinary state of play with which to meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf planted legalists sympathizing with him at the beginning of November, following the publication of the extraordinary state, has rejected all protests over the past week regarding the re-election of the Prime Minister on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal area, five soldiers were killed and four more injured as a result of an assassination against a military convoir in Northern Pakistan.
According to information provided by the military spokesperson, the bomb exploded on a road close to the Afghan border.
Fathers of Krautrock are returning
The German super team of the seventy-year-olds, the three gang members of Harmonia, re-pressed his instrument until a Berlin concert in Berlin.
At the time of the re-construction, a cut tape will appear from the time of the \"Live 1974\" age.
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The notified sensation has killed the body in person of the three consensual officers around the dinner table.
Before each one of them his own instrument, his own cable and his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of a snow white shirt after 63 years of age.
Michael Rother, who has been a youth since 57 years, is delivering an escort in the possession of a laptop and guitar.
From the public’s point of view, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curved and concentrates on the console.
Each one of them produces some kind of noise, while one or more rhythms.
This sometimes coincides with some of the traditional music.
But all this seems to be not particularly disturbing the gentlemen.
It was a great excitement for those who liked the Krautrock musical direction that Harmonia's band was again playing music.
What we can tell you here is that as a result of a proper trial, the name has been changed through the collective pop memory, but in no case has there left any permanent traces that we will miss this band painfully after 32 years.
But why should I not celebrate the legends of their seventy years?
In particular, what we call the misleading Krautrock has always been valued more than in their own country in England and America.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life Works to the still living members of the Kolni Can Group in 2003, the shape of the German pop sat in the room with an unconscious face.
When he thanked La Dusseldorf and Neu! groups in Red Hot Chili Peppers, he became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Roth used to sit on the stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old pal.
Domestic refusal and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is already overburdened by Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years, and during this time, it has had a far smaller effect than that of others.
Moebius and Roedelius have already played with Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising Cluster.
In the beginning, they played in the basement of Schaubühne, Berlin.
Then in Dusseldorf, from an economic point of view, a record company financed by the Church.
Roth helped the Kraftwerk group for a short time, and at the same time, it was perhaps the most radical German gang, the Neu! guitarist.
In 1973, however, Roth followed Cluster’s musicians into their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rhoma, was a comedian escaped from the city.
Less ideologically than in the 1st Communist, where Roedelius grew up as a sitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic artist.
According to the trash, the flag of the Harmonian Ottenstein dalard came from the trash and found a name for their art in this way.
Some things were recorded by these Harmonia.
The title of the first album is \"Musik von Harmonia\" and the next one is \"De Luxe\"
Despite the music of salmon and modest, the band suffered material needs.
The stock collection alone did not guarantee finding itself.
A CD released in Liv 1974 was recorded at a concert held in Grisesem, in front of a record audience of less than 50 people, so someone remembers.
The pressure and occasional practice of Harmonia was Roth's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its division in 1975.
Roth ended up in the esoteric and kept himself from albums like \"Flammende Herzen\"
The Closter was revitalized in the 1980s, which has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
The live album of Griezemi is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company on Greenland's name set out to take care of the Krautrock as a special German contribution to the live music.
The work of Roedelius has already been carried out by Neu! as well as by Roedelius.
Harmonia's resurrection takes place in the House of Berlin Cultures.
In public money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, author of our British grandfather and the book \"Krautrock Samler\" are also present.
Dr. Motte, the designer of the Love Parade, is also present.
All of this is largely about the effect of the Krautrock on the coming Popzenian era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills out the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno, along with the most unusual voices, floats in the room: “The only true music is his future.
There are pictures of the producer in a peasant's room with Harmonia.
Other black and white photographs made of the Kusza cable equipment are used in the legend building.
In the field, the three veterans are again occupied with improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are fixed for the organ and drum assembly with the intention of being deceived by sound effects that have not yet been heard from the instrument itself by means of its own escalating sound effects.
Today electric music looks like electric music.
Three, he's a technique-enveloper.
All of this doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and shoot, and at a beautiful part they sing \"Aaaaaaaaaah.\"
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or even in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone is crying out here, he's not walking in the wrong way, and the Harmonia won't even let himself out of his peace.
Even the most obvious thing you can think about on the stage.
Where does the music start, and where does it end?
This could keep a man nervous or give him up with moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere just wasn't cynical enough.
Two films on the Balkans are repeatedly dealt with by the \"Warning and Mörderischer Frieden\".
But none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too much for action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help it in \"Fleet.\"
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karadashics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, yet there they found him again in the dark back of the Bosnian war on the actor Richard Gere.
In recent times, we have missed the most beautiful man in the '80s, because in emotional films for women, we have played a number of good-boy-semitting roles and a lot of press conferences in the area of Buddhism have even taken our pleasure in looking at it.
And, look, suddenly Richard Gere is the strongest argument that we may still have to look at the movie “Warning. ”
It offers a wonderful, smiling design: Based on what Simon Hunt, who was formed by him, is what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so comfortable with it: A man who left his most beautiful years behind, but his decline as a ruinous monument kept a significant part of his former charm.
However, the film “Warning, ” and the German “Mörderischer Frieden, which started this week, continues to produce only the endless series of failed films of the Balkans war.
The “Mörderischer Frieden ” film does not have much to say: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel) who rescue a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly even likes it.
Although it is to be welcomed that, once, the Serbians are not represented as the only cause of all the bad, the TV film is lost too quickly in the shooting and event-like scenes.
\"Cobra carries 11-20 marks instead of a highway with a war.
On the other hand, it is exemplary in the case of the \"Veterinary\" why not even any really good films about the Balkans war have been produced.
The story of the three U.S. military scientists who are growing up to explore the Serbian war crimes called \"Rókasa\" with another director and another script writer (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) could have become a new \"Apocalypse now\" at a different time.
For stories show a surprising similarity: in both cases, small groups are cutting the forest to do what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the crazy trip is rounded.
One of the reasons why Simon Hunt does not simply let himself be a cynical person listening to his heart, as shown at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spends a romantic relationship with a woman who later killed Muslim witches.
The \"Warning\" will slide forever when reporters reach what Nato, the CIA and all the world’s prime hunters have not been able to do in the last five minutes of the film: they will commit war crimes to the Mohamedian witches for justice revenge.
It's so bad that you'd rather turn to the Hague International Law for the crime against the logic of the cinema.
But the goal of the film is deeply human.
He intends to put Karadashics and Mladics on the pelvic floor, and he suspects Americans and French people (which are supposed to be exceptionally united), that they do not continue persecution in a sufficiently intensive manner because of secret political deals.
But good and evil sometimes look so much like each other that a famous Brecht version of man gets in mind.
In this poet’s table, he writes of the Asian demon treewreck: “I look at the dwindling octopus on the ground, which reveals how exhausting it is to be.
Movies such as “Warning have the same oversized, man-headed masks that show how exhausting it is.
This problem is not limited to the art of films about the Balkans war.
Recently, they reported in the paper that all the movies about Hollywood, Iraq, were a nasty fall.
We can add: There are still no good films about South Africa.
It is almost always true: If a star moves around the world’s crisis capes or minefields, it is like “On the paths of freedom, with Patricia Arquette, with Angelina Jolie, or with the “Verious Diamond, ” with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are just too close to time.
Because they had to spend decades filming Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the Holocaust with the \"Schindler List\" film.
There are probably some films that are still coming in - because works that are considered classic today on the Vietnam War, such as “the deer hunter, the Apocalypse now, ” or “Ful Metal Jackett, ” were not celebrated in their time as a work of art.
But it can be imagined that today, when each mass killing comes directly into our home through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that deprives scriptists of ignoring reality, which would be necessary to tell good stories.
After all, “Lenni or not, or the dictator, ” they did so well because Lubbitsch and Chaplin did not even know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to be good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we need to take a sarcastically distant artistic view of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When the historical novel Lemprière-lexicon and the parallels between the Balkans and the Balkans answered: “This only depends that certain things never change.
Great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust is being criticized for the resignation of the Olympics.
The mayor's disposing of Hamburg's Summer Olympic Games has produced a strong criticism of political and economic life.
A lot of people want to keep fighting for water games.
However, Von Beust is a strong warning of reality during the odds.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jerg Schmidt-Trenz, the head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, considered the withdrawal to be unfavorable for the economic environment.
No other project has unleashed such huge motivational forces in the city recently, such as the Olympic idea.
\"Without this objective, we cannot maintain a level playing field in sport\"
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative, starting from the revised coordinates of time.
In addition to Mayor von Beust's earlier statements that his ambitions towards the Olympic Games in Hamburg are not realistic until 2028 at least.
“It is not Hamburg's decision on the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Association, ” he said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
According to the decision of the Sports Association at the beginning of December 2018, the tender was submitted for the Winter Olympic Games in Munich.
“Our preference for this means that we will not have any real chances in the period until 2028, which we have thought about so far, ”
Still, we don't give up the dream forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed his regret at von Beust's statements.
This makes the impression that Hamburg does not intend to pursue the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It is too early for us to take up an opportunity to bury our plans now, ” said Wednesday Günter Ploß, president of HSB.
In addition to the withdrawal from the application, it is contrary to the statement made by the Senate president at the General German School Sports Association meeting.
There, Von Beust Hamburg's 2015 proposal was characterised by the fact that it was not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College of Sports has only launched Hamburg as a tender city in the past week.
The civil group of the SPD has turned to the Senate that it has left valuable time for the building in Hamburg unexploited.
“Kleiner Grasbrook has been delaying the development of the Senate for years because he was sitting next to the Olympics and ignored the building, ” said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has constantly broken the flame for the Kleiner Grasbrook along with an integrated plan for the use of the Olympics and the later housing, the CDU has put emphasis on the \"event factor\" unilaterally.
The proposal for the Summer Olympic Games in 2012 has been a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg fell to Lipcé.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Who connects the concepts of Sweden and the Wall to each other is thinking of the Ikea and not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Right now, villages in Sweden are putting a dark shadow on Warhol's work list.
The ninety-four-Stockholm type, Brillo Box, is most of a counterfeit.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper Expressen called into question the originality of the Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol in 1968, now the internal investigation of the Stockholm Moderna Museet has come to a positive conclusion: In 1995, the former museum director Pontus Hultén donated six copies of the Moderna Museet Box - and, most likely, a hundred more – Stockholm types – a large part of the Brillo Box in circulation on the international art market.
It's a long and complicated chain of history, and it's a mess of artistic and devilial acts.
Warhol was formed in New York, New York, the first “Brillo Box, ” painted walls based on the red blue-white format of the “Brillo ” soap powder.
In a 1968 exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet - Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes were produced from a cardboard: they were not from Warhol for reasons of cost savings, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It wasn't about art, it was about their templates, it was about simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol authorised the manufacture of some Brillo trees in Sweden in 1968, but not in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age now speak about fifteen boxes that were then registered as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation ‘Stockholm’.
Some of them were sold for over $100,000.
The problem, however, was that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén, later on, claimed that in 1968 a hundred walls were produced and produced in Sweden, which was then left in Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 crates were only produced in Malmo in 1990 for a holy-Petervár exhibition.
At that time, however, Warhol was dead three years ago.
Next to the six Brillo Box in the museum, Lars Byström, the main monument of the Moderna Museet, examined three private boxes in Sweden, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: the print-offs were first printed and cut down, and then the white oil paint was taken off.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the 1990s is that the paint was taken directly to the pendulum, not just for oil, but for acrylic paints.
“These boxes were not certified by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes, ” says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: “Unless the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authority Board’, the Moderna Muse will classify the six boxes as copies/exhibition material in its collections, ”
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that he would investigate “several accusations ” in respect of soapy boxes.
Since then, however, they have been negligent in silence.
Manilai rebel soldiers give up
They gave up the rebellion in the Philippines, the soldiers who barricaded themselves at a hotel in Manila, and President Gloria Macapagal called for the defeat of President Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, he said to the reporters at the hotel, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, the hotel was rushed by governmented soldiers using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers have barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team stood before the court on Thursday, 2003 due to the failed coup experiment, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly take 30 sympathizers.
The military police on the man's watch clearly moved to him and joined the ring.
They entered the Peninsula-Hotel, and then they called for the defeat of Mrs Macapagal Arroyo.
The central units have locked down the area of the outstanding hotel.
The president called the security office for an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales, security advisor, condemned the military procedure.
“They’re tired of people, ” Trillanes said.
\"We call upon the people to join us\"
General Danilo Lim, who used to be the commander of the Scout Rangers Flood, stated that other military units wanted to join the process within a short time.
The judges of the government called for a strong protest against the President on Friday.
His government's been shadowed by corruption charges several months ago.
Manila's financial district was already the main stage in 2003 in the army's attempt to make a demonstration against Arroyo organized by 200 members.

United Internet will be a large-scale company in Versatel
United Internet has provided more than 20 percent of its shares in Versatel's telecommunications company.
As the company announced on Wednesday night, the average price per share was 14,46 Euro.
This represents a 20.05 percent holding of the capital.
From the takeover, they've been given guesses before.
The possibility of increasing the share acquired in Versatel remains open.
By this step, they want to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, which has been announced by the United Internet.
Prior to this, assumptions were made on Wednesday about a possible stay after the Berenberg Bank increased its existing share of the Dusseldorf network service provider by an additional 5 % to 15.1 %.
The financial institution maintains the share only as a third party, reveals the money market.
The day before, the United Internet already owned a small 10% of the Drillisch mobile company.
Within the framework of the capital increase, Drillisch made up 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
From this, United Internet acquired 5,15 million shares for EUR 31,4 million.
In addition, companies have launched a dialogue on cooperation in the market for DSL and mobile products.
“We strengthen our partnership, ” said a spokesperson at United-Internet.
The two companies jointly established an MSP joint venture for the acquisition of competing Freenet.
The two companies are initially satisfied with the good 10 percent stake in Freenet and do not have the right to take over another 18,49% of Freenet, reported on Thursday by the United Internet.
However, the two companies leave open every opportunity to increase their share in Freenet AG in particular, says the news.
Negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet has been around for months and can only be viewed as part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet was a contractual mobile phone client of 2.9 million and a client with 1.27 million DSL and fixed access.
So far, the United Internet and the holding company Drillisch had a direct 6,01 percent share in Freenet.
There's a deal now that Drillisch brings another round four percent.
An agreement was reached on the right to purchase 18,49 percent of the Vatas investment company in August.
