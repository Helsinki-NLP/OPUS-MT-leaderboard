I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing dangerous work?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no question about it.
It's affecting everyone.
It's not over until we're done.
I'll take her place.
I work on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
It comes with the love I feel for you.
It cost me a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all this work wasted.
He clearly freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow hasn't stopped.
You're gonna let me see if you're coming.
You won't do anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they put it on me.
I slowly realized I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the last day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
That's what happened at the beginning of the last week.
This was just on the day of our marriage, honey.
There had to be a reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
That's what happened when he was outside.
It happened several times to me.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
I've got my own value.
It's raining on Tuesday.
I think all fat people should be on diet.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll have a good time with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think there's been a couple of movies out there.
I think I can.
I don't think I can kill him.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
It's a very small probability, I think you'll be able to do that yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think so.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you better go now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll have a good time with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's not right.
I find spiders for candy.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget this.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think it makes any sense that we're trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I believe that time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was already there.
I think Tomi's agitating.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tamás wins.
I think we can deal with it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we've turned the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all screwed now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Tamás's girlfriend is.
I think you're gonna make it up to me.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job's really good.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went out to dinner, it'd cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe it was worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head would blow up.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the floor, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought he was coming, Tom.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
It hurts.
I'm under the influence.
It had a very big effect on me.
It's an accident!
It's a historical scene.
It's hard to put into practice what it was about.
It's hard for everyone to get in touch with.
It's hard for everyone to do it.
I doubt it's gonna work.
It's getting very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's about time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We have to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's never too late to study.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be turned off.
It's not the best solution.
It's not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not right to talk to people.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, it's a really bad time today!
It's so fucking expensive!
It's 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him to do.
It's up to you.
It's useful information.
The heat's high at night.
It's very important to wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
He'll be ready when he needs it.
He'll be ready when he has to.
It'll take you a while to get used to wearing your glasses.
He'll be gone soon.
It'll work when I replace polarities.
So it looks bigger.
It looks good.
It doesn't seem like I'm needed here.
You could use a shaving.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This can save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy it if we tried it.
I might be late.
You need to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
It's got to be fixed.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
Even so, I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like tomi.
I have a question for you, too.
I've bathed for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I was on my 58th trip.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
The rain broke yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I'm training two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I went to the United States in cross-country.
Actually, it's working.
It's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep him alive.
I was trying to forget.
I was trying to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Big-time cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
That's a good plan, at least on paper.
A gray stone building.
This is a housekeeper dog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's totally dark out there.
This is all mine.
It's all right now.
That's nice and good in theory, but will this practice work?
It's all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock in the evening.
One of my dreams was always living next to a stream.
It's always the same stuff.
An environmental disaster.
It's a nasty business, Watson, a nasty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big deal.
It's a nightmare.
It's cold.
It's just as art as much as science.
This is from the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where a minor mistake can cause a serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's a tiring day.
It's a rough day.
It was like this before.
It wasn't just a week.
It's been two years since she left me.
That's better.
I'd like to go to the garden at night.
Firelight.
Oh, my God.
It's cheaper to get on a bus.
That's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed every Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
He's known the bear likes honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or didn't.
It's totally normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
This is delicious.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
Looks like the bus was late.
That sounds ridiculous.
Looks like it was only yesterday that we went to school together.
It doesn't seem like anything's changed.
It looks very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
It looks to me like you're being honest.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're gonna have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
My dear.
It's fair to get the same salary for the same job.
It's not even perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's starting to get serious.
We're gonna have a lot of money.
It won't be easy.
It's lucky to see a falling star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good to learn.
I'm glad you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's not hard to reach that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that all this time was clean and sunny.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town that can be slept on.
It's hard to put in words.
It's hard to express words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it'
He's got a very large head.
Tall.
The kids are already in bed.
Stop the cash flow!
It's hotter than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
This is important.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It's important that we help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just move.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
Just that I don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
It's washing today.
It's like a sub-sea field, and turtles, horns and sharks over it, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how she lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
None of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
Not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
It won't happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negociable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not important what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth crying about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't testify guilty.
There's no point in running in the past.
It's snowing.
Apparently it's broken.
Clearly impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's not a problem if some people think you're a peasant.
It's okay if you're gay.
“ It’s been three months, and Tomi says he speaks French in a liquid way.
It's only three days.
The park's on the other side.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It looks like I'm pouring it out.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that this mizantrop theory is designed to express itself in an assessment of the working class, saving the imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars that he has worked on, and to believe the core of the thought that man's congenital aggressive tendencies of endless wars are the causes of it.
It's really urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's a big deal.
That's where it is.
It's unruly to ask someone how much he's looking for.
They say the Czech girls are nice.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to stay home.
It's still moving.
It's suicide.
That's technically possible.
It's the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
We still have to answer that.
It's time we took our tents.
It's time for us to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should get my hair cut.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's about time we did something about it.
Tom's birthday is today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
That's expensive to me.
Now it's too hot for this.
Late grief.
It's too late to worry about.
It's typical autumn time.
It's a bad thing to get cold.
It's ugly yellow, it's nothing harmonised, but at least they don't get gas in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
It's not likely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you to go or not.
Very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's really fun.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very nice of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
It's your only chance.
About 10,000 hours of learning is needed to master a language thoroughly.
Must be bold for success.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me nearly three years to build my house.
He's got everyone unexpected.
It took about an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick up a pair of shoes.
It took me a long time, but we finally found it.
I went to a little alley.
I'm a kid.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was a good party.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a silly question.
It was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was a really great meal.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was so weird.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was obviously very enjoyable.
We had a good time last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the time was parallel.
It was just a runaway.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost an early dark one.
It was not long before John had an idea, and John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
That wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy for me to keep my promise.
That was a hit below the belt.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't deliberate.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't so bad.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was just a joke.
I only learned his true purpose when I met him.
