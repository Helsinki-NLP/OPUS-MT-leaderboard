There was a 9-year-old boy in Tampere runaways.
The police have had a search mission for a nine-year-old boy on the run to Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance statement on the boy who left from West Trampere with his friend has spread to social media.
According to the police station, the boy's been contacted, and he's not in danger of life and health.
The son's father told East Solomon half-night, knowing he had a son.
He's fine, and now we're starting a set-up.
The boy was found in the neighborhood near the home. Dad told me.
Ronaldo once again as a charm... rips the goal difference to the Messin.
Cristiano Ronaldo struck five goals in Spain's league weekend and continued his factory in the Master's league.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Master's league goal queen turned at least for a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time target statistics when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits from the penalty kicks and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his paint balance to 80 when before Tuesdays with him, Barcelona Messi, who was even-ready, had 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
The Juventus has compromised the Italian football league in Serie A from the early days, but at the Master's League's D-section it began with a forceful 2-1-visual victory in Manchester City.
The conqueror did a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city attack was bored by the absence of a kneeling Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend dial game, came to the field only on the last ten minutes of news.
Also, the Manchester Second Society United experienced hardships against PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
The visit to Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old paratrooper, could only last a quarter of an hour.
The dangerously-looking slideback of PSV Hector Moreno hit the goal of an attack on the ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw lay on Eindhoven's home stand for tens of minutes before the medical staff went to carry him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to the 1-0 wire in 41 minutes, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno set off before the break with more time.
In the second half, the PSV’s winning painting was made by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Master's league of the paintmaking season, Paris Saint-Germain started the A-block.
The case was the change of Manchester United's shirt to the PSG, Argentinan Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball in the rear corner of Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 PSG for the second half.
The PSG has been ranked among the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of too longevity, is not the best reference target.
The first time Zlatan Ibramovic, the PSG star hunter, met Malmo FF, his professional career.
Ibramovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow TsSKA lost the B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce - the president gave the wrong speech.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had spoken a month ago.
The Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe, has again spoken in Parliament at the end of last month.
In his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91 years old in full spirit.
The main opposition party MDC insisted on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to control.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place solely in Mugabe’s office and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with China's influence on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading summits, assesses the request.
According to Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how they would be more effectively registered in Europe.
Negotiations on asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, part of the Internal Ministers' table.
Professor admits that he shot his girlfriend in an emergency phone call.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University asked for a voice on the emergency phone with a little bit of a star cop at his house and told me that he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their dear dog was present and alive and probably afraid. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
In the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and the message written on the white paper: “I’m very sorry and hope that I could cancel what I did. I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me, Lamb’s signed a letter that read according to the authorities.
There were no signs that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the campus of the school.
Ms Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, stated that the university's authority was informed about the shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
She said that Lamb called a fatal emergency call some time after this.
There was one more death today, and she took her own life when the police caught her.
The next day the students and the teaching staff were staring behind the locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
The researchers examined the details in both places, and the people who knew Lamb told them about the man, and the researchers were born with a picture of the talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor's hours.
According to the Gautier Police Department of the Prentiss State, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb's book of recognition for the human beings with whom he was allowed to spend academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with 17 teaching staff members. Many of the students attended the courses of both men.
However, there were five problems.
Lamba's sarcastic student Brandon Beavers told me that the professor seemed to be agitated and nervous, as if he had something to do with it.
Another student named Mike Sykes said that Lamb had told him about the stress in the late 2014-2015 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university remuneration policy meant that the statement for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee her assistant professor's office.
The head of the university, William LaForge, told me that he was not aware of the Crusades between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that there was something clearly bothering Lamb.
Lamb can't answer these questions anymore.
After the campus left, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, she had taken her own life with a 38-calibre pistol in the back yard of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a half mile from her parents' home, the D.C.K.D.'s killer, Methel Johnson, told her.
Lamb's car was still in the driveway.
The police didn't know exactly why Lamb had gone to this house, but Johnson told me he believed that he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started work as a professor of science and education at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009.
He got his doctorate in the field of education in spring.
One of Lamb's long-term friends described this as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met with Lamb's mutual friends when she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old.
She was still in high school with her friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitarism for years.
The sheep was quite a heartbreaker then.
All the girls were on her cell, told Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had probably been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that she had killed her wife, but according to any document they have not been dedicated.
A couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river shower in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me he divorced Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
He was so upset, O'Steen said about his daughter.
The daughter and mother were best friends.
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail appeared in both summer events three years ago.
Later on, they sometimes also called together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter is writing and playing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and a part-time entertainment coordinator in the modest The Jules Room, outside Gauter, reported that he had seen Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and lip-thirsty for the rare audience.
There was no language that something was wrong.
- Happy couple, Shaffer said.
- We had a fight together.
Both had a good sense of humor.
“Professant Schmidt, who received his death, directed the first year of seminars and was specialized in the history of the Indians and colonial times, ” told Professor Don Allan Mitchell of England.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and the student community.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland there are 900 people gathered at the Memorial in the candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the night, where the university choir presented the paragraphs ‘Bright Morning Star’ and ‘Amazing Grace’.
Education continues on Wednesday.
We're trying to get the students back, LaForge said.
- The crisis is over.
This is a healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting on the Mississippi Cleveland.
Donors: Associated Press's journalists Emily Wagster Pettus in Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, as the police are now telling us that Lamb called the emergency call after Schmidt was shot. It was also noted that even though Lamb referred to the emergency call as her wife of Prentiss, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us is not going to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells that he is offering his current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company intends to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014 it employed 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The interview of applicants will begin this month, and new workers will start in October to December.
Although there are months to leave, the trade season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for sales and delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his date with Princess Diana.
The first night of the future film was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night was also of personal importance.
We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I noticed that there was an empty place next to me, and I was told that Princess Diana is coming to my house, and Fox told me the future back in Time paper trailer.
When the movie started, I realized that the situation reminded me of the date with the Princess of Wales.
The back in Time document is linked to the Pane Future Films, and in addition to Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd are interviewed as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The film back to the future got its first night 30 years ago.
This film is definitely a time travel movie for me, Mr Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD format, and it is presented in selected cinemas from October.
UN Secretary General: no military solution in Syria
Ban Ki-moo, UN Secretary General, commented on Russia's enhanced military efforts and notes that there is no military solution to nearly five years of conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to pool their powers and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the Wednesday press conference, Ban reported his intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Mr Ban regretted the fact that the fragmentation of the Security Council, the people of Syria and regional forces has brought about a situation which is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the same level of solidarity and unity that reached the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Eight of the tests: Is Donald Trump serious?
The Trumpics have been tried to bake for nothing.
He's also been regarded as a joke.
Some people predict Trump's collapse.
The Republican circles have (the 16th) achieved every effort to pull Trump down from the gallup.
Ten of the eleven national gallup shows Donald Trump two-digit support numbers, and some are already seriously considering what it is about the possibility of running a real estate module.
Of course, the elections are just in the early stages.
It's not yet been declared that Trump's been elected Republican candidate.
Experts remind me that Rick Perry, who was at the galluctuary of this time in 2011, was able to give space to the rising Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the stand-up plant in any state.
For many reasons Trump would be difficult in general elections.
External groupings such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and started digging up to his cover.
The following recent gallup data indicate that the property mogul can not be ignored by customising the shoulder:
Trump's position has been a full-fledged version.
Just before Trump announced that he was a candidate in mid-June, according to the University of Monmouth, only two of the ten Republicans had a positive picture of real estate.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive image.
At the beginning of the year, the corresponding proportion was 52%.
Now six out of ten Republicans are a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten have a negative image.
These figures also refer to the states where the elections will be held first.
In last week's Quinni market galluja, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two third Republicans would be satisfied with Trump's nomination.
In CNN and the ORC gallujac last week 67% of Republicans said they were very happy or satisfied with Trump’s choice as candidates.
Only two out of ten would be extremely dissatisfied with Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson is almost as eager to receive as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's proposal and 40% of Trump's candidates).
Who is next the most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose equivalent support rate is 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or extremely dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected candidates for the party.
Most Republicans do not find Trump's temperation problematic.
Donald Trumpmis has been widely criticised for the volume and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the property mogul to be suitable for the president, as is the opinion of ABC News and Washington Post.
The same is true for Iowa, where the first party meeting is to be held: According to the Quinni market gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities appropriate to the chief of defence forces.
According to ABC and Post gallup, 44% believe Trump is unable to function effectively and six out of ten considers Trump's temperament incompatible with the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans ask who is most likely to be elected candidates for the party, according to CNN and the ORC gallulum, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money in place for Jeb Bush.
Total: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in their use.
At this stage in the last elections, four of the ten Republicans considered Rick Perry likely to be a candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if Republicans supported another candidate, Trump covers almost all other candidates.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump’s opponents are divided into different candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University's opinion poll revealed that in an imaginary duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate Trump would receive a greater support for him almost always.
He runs Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubita with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bushia with 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasichi and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and I have him on level.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take a win from Trump with 19 points apart in an imaginary double fight.
A small majority of Trumpin’s supporters are already telling us that he has made a vote.
According to the gallup published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, half of Trump's supporters are sure to vote.
The situation may change for many reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not taken a final decision.
Trump's current very rival is neurosurgery Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of the colonialism.
In his campaign call to Donald Trump, the migrants who came from Mexico two months ago have been a hot subject for 2016.
Some are concerned about the fact that Trump's powerful speeches deport important Latin American voters from the Republicans and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to the opinion polls of ABC News and Washington Post published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump.
As long as migration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Ignorance towards administration is at its top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting around half of the Republicans' votes. A significant increase is that both have come outside.
The Republican forces wanted to make a fresh face rather than a political coronary, according to ABC News and Washington Post's latest opinion polls, that was the opinion of Republicans in six out of ten.
These two candidates are also pissed off at Washington.
According to the opinion of Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the activities of Republicans in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% on the edge of the rage.
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
After the elections, Corbyn's first visit at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been excited.
For the first time, the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected not to be able to stand up in David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corby's first six questions have been raised shortly after midday, and the media and the workers' representatives are following a man's eye hard.
Corby has claimed less theater and more facts for a weekly show.
He has also stated that he can pass on some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corby's leadership will be weighed for the first time in the meeting. Corby will undergo a parliamentary test now following the speech of the assembly of shadow government and the Central Organisation of Corbyn's Trade Unions at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to remain silent in the 75th anniversary of the British Air War held on Tuesdays during the National Song has been criticised by several representatives of the Tory Party. The debate has also ended with the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn’s silence during the national singing attracted attention
The representative of Corbyn stated that Corbyn was standing in a national song while respecting in silence the heroity of the Royal Air Forces in the battle with Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, said in the BBC Two's Newslight programme that he would have called on the leader of the party to join a national song despite the opposition of this monoarchic.
The 10 shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's platoons, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs.
Robin Brant, a BBC political correspondent, considers that political differences in the membership of the UK and the conditions for granting government benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Corby said at the TUC meeting that Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions completely.
A few hours later, Minister of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government said that the position of the party is very clear: it only opposes government plans to reduce the limit from 26 000 to 23 000.
Corbyn is the fifth Director of Labour, who David Cameron will meet in charge of the Tory party over the past decade.
The new approach to policy-authorised Labour says that he chose Cameron's questions to be raised to the public by 30,000 proposals he received.
According to the Corbyn, elected from the district of Islington North, Question Time has too much collusion, and he promises to avoid clever words and petitions, and he says that he concentrates rather on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corby has stated that the shadow minister, Angela Eagle, is behind him during Question Time, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also given us an idea that others will also be able to get out at times, and he will tell us that he has spoken to Mr Bercowin, President of the House.
As Corbyn got into the party leadership in 2005, Cameron said he wanted a doll theater policy, which is often associated with a survey, but some years later he admitted that he had failed in his efforts.
Since Question Time was first broadcast in 1990, it has been regarded as a key measure of leadership’s judgment, sub-room management and position. However, according to criticisms, Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
\"Shot in Joburg\": homeless young photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for homeless people.
The group of former street children has found a meaningful way to learn and make.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profitable photo studio where homeless young people are taught to photograph their home and earn at the same time.
The BBC News met a young person who has completed the project through the first one.

The increase in the increase in the UK wages
The increase in wages was confirmed in Britain, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index up.
In May to July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK from the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not calculated.
The fastest growth forecast was the fastest since 2009.
The cost was increased by 1%, and its rate was quoted at USD 1.5505.The cost was also increased in relation to the euro and quoted at EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6.229.21 points.
The largest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate was reduced by 20 per cent when the company received a preliminary bid from AB InBev.
When it comes to doing business, the world's two biggest brewing companies would be combined with brandy under the same roof, including, for example, Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9 per cent from the old water positive result of the Richemont Group that focuses on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast, and the development of the sales was also due to the rise in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore’s share rose by 5% of the miners’ announced intentions to raise a share of $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The Multi Group’s shares were the largest drop of 4.3% when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company’s shares for the sale.
The JD Sports course rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its income before taxes would rise by 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports: higher wage costs could be detrimental to enlargement
According to Peter Cowgill, the chairman of JD Sports's board of directors, the increase in the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not enough to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports's enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour force.
Metcash launches a grass-rooted campaign against Aldi's vendetta
Metcash is trying to secure his IGA sale from Aldi's throne in South and West Austria.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-rooted campaign to maintain the market share of IGA's retail stores in South and West Austria against Aldin's $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi will open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and West Austria at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand in the marketing of power transmissions and social media and organise events such as Adelaide-show.
IGA stores and suppliers and many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory in Dunsborough, Simmo offers taste in IGA stores, and merchants sell tickets to the stock customers at discount prices to the South Australian football league.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information about his defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade team organises the annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market because South and West Austria account for nearly 30% of Metcash's IGA footprints, and in these areas coverage is higher than that of the IGA sales network in Eastern states.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their corner population, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Austria, the market share is 30% and 24% in West Austria, whereas in the eastern states only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will catch 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first stores.
This week Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA traders can sell $360 million and Metcashi's $250 million vacation by the end of 2016.
The prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Austria next year and sell 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Metcashi's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume may mean losing 13 million dollars in the result before interest rates and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although according to the recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group’s leading portfolio manager, Hamish Douglass, told us that, at the event in Melbourne, it was very likely that Metcash would disappear completely within 10 years.
Metcash has refused to take public position on Douglas's comments.
It is understandable that Mr. Metcash's board member contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen since 2010 from 18% to 14%, and the result of Metcash's food business serving the 1200 IGA dealer has fallen by 43% from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesale operator takes counter-measures and makes over $150 million of Australian dollars a year in response to the prices of Coles and Wolworths for hundreds of products per week. Ketju wants to support traders in the process of reforming their stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the choice of food for trade.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, stated that the price checks and the sales reform plans are in good shape, and the company is able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Vice President of Australia's tennis union, Steve Healy, defends Thanasi Kokknak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behaviour rather than a particular mention of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, the president of the Australian tennis union, Thanas Kokkinakis has been a mere victim in the recent Nick Kyrgios jukas, which deserves a special mention rather than a criticism.
The two younger parties named \"Special K's\", Kokknakis, became the unfavorable light language when the bad boy Kyrgios provos his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon after this, the judge had to split the competition partners in Cincinnati between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison.
In an open U.S. state, Kokkinakis was frustrated in the field of the ground when the strong convulsions ruined his fight, and Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinaki.
At the moment, the teenager is in Glasgow, where Sam Groth and his team are fighting the second-to-one gamer behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semi-final against the Great Britain.
- I think very strongly that Thana has been dragged into his dispute, - Healy said.
He's not the first player to break his mail because he's frustrated. I know Thanas well enough that he's not proud to do it.
He has, however, endured very well the provocative use of Harrison in the United States, for example, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature at age 19, he works hard and completes a very good team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected by players. He is practicing hard, is in good condition and is a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated on his own sea routes.
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from Australia's team's important round, which begins on Fridays. Healy describes the solution as a common decision for all parties. However, he is in favour of returning the Canberra to the team for a long time.
“In the first place, we want to focus fully on the games instead of Kyrgios - Healy said.
Nick has risen quickly to the top. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the light of publicity. He deserves his criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we have tried to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to provide him with his own peace.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
The state of emergency declared Hungary closed its southern border on Serbia on Tuesday and captured illegal migrants, with a view to preventing the migration flows.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants came together to no one, and the Serbian authorities were angry.
People fleeing violence had to remain on the road between the control stations of the countries for an indeterminate period of time.
The collapse began to rise.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the settlers, they said, \"Open the border, and screamed insults to Hungarian mellow police.
Some started protesting about eating and drinking.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as further arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation should be discussed in the next few days in Brussels and also in other countries, and Ivica Dacic stated in Prague.
At the border between Hungary and Serbia, the day later, when a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common migration policy at the controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the flooding of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and the hope for an agreement to be reached by next month or by the end of the year on which 120 000 migrants from the EU Member States would receive from Hungary, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not wish for urgent action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that in the two southern regions authorities were able to use more effective means, i.e. to shut you down and speed up the legal processes relating to asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a track road to the Romanian border in order to prevent the flow of migrants from the direction that now the Serbian border is already equipped with a fence.
CBS News's correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners participated in the final work of the Hungarian-Serbian peaks.
In recent months Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, and many of these immigrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the incoming people are living refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek security.
According to the new law that entered into force in Hungary at midnight, there is a crime of crossing or damage to the four-metre high peaks of barbed wire that the government has built towards the southern border towards Serbia.
“As a result of the crisis caused by migration, the government announces the crisis, ” reported the government informant Zoltan Kovacs to journalists in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
-We follow a tight line: illegal crossing is a crime.
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt military measures that are expected next week. The suppliers of the Associated Press News Office at the border have for many days seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Internal Security Officer of Orban, told us that the authorities have caught 45 crossings of the border trying immediately at the border and 15 miles away.
By harming the people across the border are now under police command, charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities are quick to fix the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities shut down two of the seven crossing points at the Serbian border on Tuesday. One of the crossing points was shut down by means of a train wagon covered by a barbed wire.
Kaos took over the main border crossing point near Roske in Hungary, when Hungarians opened the small metal container’s point of contact where people packed in.
About 20 were in, but thousands were out.
The second group of migrants blocked the main street, which links Serbia and Hungary, and the people declared themselves in the law on food and drink until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership with Bernie Sanders reduced side by side of the national gallup
The support percentage of the former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still two-digit in the race as the national candidate for the democratic presidential election, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the gap.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the vote of the Democrats (out of 58%), while Sanders has a second 27% position (up from 17%).
The vice-president, Joe Biden, has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential race, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the presidencies for most of the Democrats, it is too soon to tell who they are in favour of.
Clinton's supporters, however, are more sure of the choice of other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News, Clinton has lost support from a number of democratic groups, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's patience among men has fallen significantly, and he has only a 5% thread compared to Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership among Democrats under 50 years of age, and he's now on a level with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
In the last month, Clinton's first contribution to the Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five-percent unit of neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats would like to announce their support for Clinton if he is elected candidates for the party.
A fourth would support Clinton with limited reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that the current supporters of Clinton would also be particularly zealous if he was elected a candidate.
There is more to be seen among those who are not currently in favour of Clinton, only about a quarter of his support for him with zeal.
In turn, only 35% of the Republican voters would strongly support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton's voters are invited to freely describe why they support their proposals, the most popular justification is Clinton's right experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to select the female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
Furthermore, common views and opportunities to win the actual elections are mentioned.
The vice-president still weighs on his potential candidates, and 57 percent of the Democrats would like him to go to the race, and a third would rather leave him out of the race.
When a second most popular candidate is questioned by democratic voters as a party candidate, most of them will choose Biden.
Over half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular in Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democrats' candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase his way towards Sanders. With Sanders, there are 20 percentage points, and it will grow to 30 percent if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of Democrats consider Clinton to be a candidate with the best chances of winning the actual elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden in second place is a long way from Clinton, but more and more believes in Biden's chances of winning the actual elections.
However, democratic voters hold views on issues of greater importance to the winning possibilities of candidates.
Voters do not like candidates for democracy or potential candidates to accept anyone as unacceptable.
voters consider candidates or potential candidates suitable for their characteristics.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable and leadership types.
Biden is often described as honest, while Clinton is most often regarded as a leader.
Even 30% of Democrats think Clinton is not honest and reliable, compared with 15% of Sanders. 27% can't say if Sanders is honest.
Democrats believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the voter's own ideology.
About a quarter of all characteristics have no opinion about Sanders.
When people ask for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as foreign minister, most of the Democrats say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and it has not changed the views of these voters on Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third is satisfied.
The opinion of the people was divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
Most Americans consider that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall image of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Most of this 36%, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While the voters of their own party consider Clinton honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these qualities when asking for the views of all voters: Clinton thinks only 32% is honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country do not think Trumpi is honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good grades for leadership.
The six candidates involved in the questionnaire were considered to be more reliable than Mr Biden, Mr Carson and Mr Bush.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters and the error margin of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is going to take care of Donald Trump's lead in a national trial.
The CBS News and the New York Times report that Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates covered more than half of their votes in the new survey, and left the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has a strong support among Republican voters in the whole country. The support share has risen from 23% of the CBS survey, which was conducted in Fox News last month. On Tuesday, the subsidy rate is 27%.
Carson's support would, however, be at a huge increase in the same time, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support in all the population groups, and in a high-educated group, he beats Trump so badly.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will remain far away.
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida shared their third position with a support of 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 Republican speaker is 6% in the direction or in the other direction. The survey was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey published last week, CNN and the ORC, Carson's support is rising, and 19% of Republicans are in favour of him when Trump's support is 32%.
Also, in the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was clearly leading ahead of Carson.
In a man's last week encounter, Trump committed unrelenting charges for retired neurosurgery, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
We need energy, Trump said on Saturday he was campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the Division charged with the death of the Baruch College Fuks
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the department's ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people will be charged with murder.
According to the police, Deng did not deliver Deng in time to a hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes had been tied, his back had been put almost 15 kg of sand-filled bag and had been repeatedly attacked by his attempts to reach the target that had been placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng is first told about his chosen headache and then he lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of Pi Delta Pss didn't call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness and they said they were waiting an hour before Deng took him to the hospital.
At the press conference, Commissioner Chris Wabner told me that members were able to change Deng's clothes, googla his symptoms, and contact President Andy Meng.
At this stage, the members began to hide the equipment, putting Michael Deng's health ahead of the department's interests, and Mr Wagner said.
Deng wasn't resuscitated, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times on the head, upper body, and traveling with a boring object.
“A large number of families have had to be shocked by the mutilation of the department, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the simulation since 1970, ” says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family in his opinion.
Divisions and their members must be responsible for taking an important step.
The great jury in Monroe County presented five members of the department for the murder of the third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the Division will be charged with mutilation and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
“We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for the organisation officially or officially approved by the simulation, ” Mr Wagner reported on Tuesday at the press conference.
Baruch College has imposed an operating ban on the department, and the National Department has resigned from the functioning of the local division.
Thus, the increase in the interest rates of the US Central Bank (Fed) is influenced by
Interest rate increases and stock market rises are acidifying, the return on securities is rising, and the economy is falling apart.
That's what we know.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, as regards the economy, we find a historical reference to the timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively raising interest rates, although not always. The crucial factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates but to the length of the normalisation process.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
At the end of the day, however, market players may find that any increase in interest rates may be excessive.
“The first increase in the Bank after the global financial crisis was, of course, often considered to be a sign of the end of cheap money, Julian Jessop, the Chief Economics Chief global economics told its customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a scary standing shock for many.
However, it does not mean that there is no effect.
Examples of how impacts can be seen in different economic sectors, based on historical trends:
As has been seen on the market for about a month, raising interest rates may increase instability for some time.
When the interest finally rises, the effect is not so dramatic.
“The trend seems to be the situation of capital interest income after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy, while Deutsche Bank’s analyst noted in the recent study of interest rate increases.
As specified over 35 years, a sharp rise in interest rates is generally seen on the market at the time of the increase of around 14 per cent, with a relatively steady increase of 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 per cent), after 500 days, the situation is normalised and the average interest income after the six-day period is 14.4 per cent, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management'schief equity strategy in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the shares is generally slightly more pronounced at a later stage in the cycle and interest incomes start to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the increase in interest rates usually works.
In this case, if the central bank meets the conditions that were not in place before and could accelerate the billing rate.
It is of particular importance that the GDP is at its lowest ever in the light of the increase in central bank interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 increases in the steering rate since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it sustainable, and in the third quarter there is 1.5 per cent, reports the Regional Bank of Atlanta.
The increase in interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation may pose a risk and may be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market participants have been talking about raising the guide rate throughout the year, and the views turn to this week's Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategies and ecosystems believe that even if the open market committee accepted a lift at this meeting, future trade seems to be only 25% likely.
The report states that since 1950, all raising cycles have been in the supercycle, where GDP is also rising very rapidly since the rise of the recession.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst sheep in the comparison period.
Sykli is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now is already going for 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the former market for interest rates, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
The difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to be changing immediately when the first up/down cycle starts.
At the end of the rise cycle, the returns immediately fall, Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategyists believe that the interest rate will draw long and short-term bonds closer to each other and balance the curve.
“Student bonds often do better in this environment, although we are still cautious about returns, ” said Kathy Jones, the analyst for fixed-income securities in Schwab.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the forthcoming change in direction of the central bank.
“In addition to dollar consolidation and inflation forecasts, a number of signs of the adjustment to financial policy are already being seen, ” says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the return curve is straight, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased, all of which are typical of the market in which the central bank tightens policy.
Extensively, companies that operate mainly on the US market benefit because the interest rate is falling and local products start to attract.
The prospects for debt-to-equity multinationals are weaker, as the strengthening dollar will make their products rise on the global market and the debt rise.
It shows that the quality shares are more profitable than interest rates in the next three months, and that Goldman Sachs' analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet, after the interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, hit the weak balance sheet by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares were also better off, on average, 4 and 3 percentage points better.
It's a big question.
The most loss of companies with a significant share of variable interest rates was noted by Goldman.
In general, outside the stock market, consumers will also benefit from increasing the dollar.
Savings also benefit from higher returns, although experts are not sure how quickly they can see the effects.
Parliamentaryist Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for over-popularisation.
Bingham now believes it is difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
He also claims that the BBC Music Awards Awards is only a copy of the Brits gala.
The Voice channel is accused of being impersonal.
According to a significant parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 gradually becomes a copy of the Classic FM channel, and the charges increase the pressure on the station to prove that they offer other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the head of BBC that the radio channel of the public broadcaster is becoming too populist and that the channel is no longer able to distinguish itself from its commercial competitor.
- I don't want to talk about populism, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards Classic FM, - Bingham said.
BBC Music Awards will also be able to criticise Bingham for the award of the BBC Music Awards last December:
\"Last year, the BBC Music Awards appear to be a copy of the British Prize Gallery.
These two are examples that instead of a new and different one, only imitate what is already on the market, Bingham states.
The President of the BBC denied the accusations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers significantly more lively music and enlightening content to a commercial competitor.
-Radio 3 taught me about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to living music and music is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works, and the President said.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, director of the BBC Radio 3 said that the position needed to work harder to maintain public interest because the British know classical music better.
However, radio 3 is not the only one to be critical of entering the territory of commercial channels in consultation with the BBC channel, the restricted Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Tory Party parliamentarian Damien Collins criticized the Voice talent competition, which BBC bought from a Dutch producer Talpa Media, which was estimated at GBP 22 million.
“There is little debate on knowledge, because it is neither unique nor particularly distinguishing –
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by the BBC1, which, as star judges, is excellent by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way for the BBC.
Collins also called on the company to look for a hit-and-run program on its own house next time it launches a new series of entertainments.
However, Collins did not agree to continue to order the Voice series or to spend taxpayers' money on other entertainment forms.
The growth of online commerce in August – perhaps black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by seven per cent.
The sales of online commerce have been recorded since 2000. Last month, the growth was slowest in all time.
Three years ago, the online store was strengthened by mobileization.
Experts believe that the black Friday of November can control shopping requests.
Over a decade, many of the British shopping wars have been deserted by the conquest of online commerce.
According to experts, there are indications that there is a level playing field for online commerce and that the new sales figures show only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest at the time of the statistics on online sales, i.e. since 2000. Last year, online sales grew by only 5 per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that there is a level playing field for online commerce and that the new sales figures show only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
\"If we compare the growth of last year to the 2000s, it is clear that growth will be balanced over time,\" Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IRG, told Guardian.
According to Mulcay, online commerce was accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobileization.
As a result, more and more people were able to buy online, and many were able to buy them in different environments, such as domestic couches.
As mobile participation is more moderate, growth can turn out to be unbalanced.
The black Friday from America is a phenomenon considered to be one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November may lead consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online buyers in comparison with the usual ones got many traders' websites down.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which makes consumers tugging after offers, can control purchases during the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, fair pounds per 5 pounds were consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes instead of web-bought fashion boxes.
We're gonna bury the crash of the cranes, the Bin Laden family.
The Muslims carried 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the big construction company Saudi Arabia Group is part of the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured when the crane fell.
The bodies were applied in high air when the Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mekka's Great Moss.
A group of white - dressed people were gathered on the streets to say good - bye to the victims on their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
It was in a pilgrimage where only one day earlier the crash of the building was intruding through the roof of the Musketeer.
The king of Saudi Arabia calls for the family company of Bin Laden building industry to be held liable for an accident involving 394 people.
In the accident of Mecca’s Great Moskeer, the bodies of 29 dead victims were transported on the streets.
Among the dead who had fallen, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Suur-Manchester, had traveled with his first pilgrimage to Mecca.
Akram had been with his parents in the Grand Moskeja, who were about to begin their annual creed-holy journey.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised to organise a Hajj-sacred holiday when thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom when the crane was not used.
According to the Arab press release, Binladin Group is involved in the accident.
The English-speaking service of the News Office did not report any details of the matter. However, according to the English-speaking information, the management of the group is prohibited from leaving the country.
Previously this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane in the yard of the Great Moskei. Thousands of Muslims will be headed to the Great Moskeja's spread holy spirit later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a notice on the crane accident and the Group's representatives have not been targeted for the opinion.
The king also accused the group of not complying with up-to-date safety regulations and cooperated with meteorology experts.
The tens cranes are surrounded by Mekka's Great Moskeja as part of the giant construction project of Binladi Group.
The Bin Laden family has had close contacts with the Saudi Arabian regime for decades, and Bin Ladens is responsible for several major building projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was the apostate boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
Only a few days before the pilgrimage Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim, occurred in a rough rain and in a heavy wind, was to do at least once in life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (i.e. EUR 250 000) to the victims' families and permanently injured.
The other injured persons will receive half the compensation.
According to B&Q, low Eastern European labour force is behind the phenomenon.
The British employ more and more people at home, says Veronique Laury.
Popularity has been increased by skilled workers from Eastern Europe, who are professional workers.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, chief translator, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer home hammering and painting work to factors arriving from Eastern Europe.
The art of hammering and painting seems to be few today.
The British are increasingly employing household generals to handle home nickaration work, says the leader of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO at Kingfisher, who owns a chain of home repairs. According to Laury, the phenomenon is based on professional skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe who provide services at affordable prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour for B&Q stores, for eight out of ten purchase decisions at the store makes a woman.
At present, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, there is a need to take account of demographic trends, as more and more alone women today also repair their homes.
\"Our sales staff are still mostly men,\" Laury says.
We need to balance the situation.
Half our customers are women, and 80% of the buying-in decisions make women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of the five women who are at the top of the British FTSE 100, and has also reorganised the management team of the company so that male and female leaders are balanced.
Kingfisher is almost the only one because 50% of its staff are women, including the CEO and the financial director.
This was an informed decision, and it is an important subject for us, Laury told us.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the board.
Kingfisher’s half-year operating profit and sales figures have fallen despite the company’s hard work since the closure of the stores.
Kingfisher is in line with current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open 200 new stores.
The government of three anaesthetics decided to rely on forced legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were therefore achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other income center organisations began to be forced immediately and, as a result, the country is standing on Friday because of the extensive expression of the employees.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
Let's see if it's worth the strike when it's bad anyway.
Even the resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already reported that they are not going to take part in demonstrations but are going to work.
This would have been impossible for an old consensus.
Of course, there was nothing online to protest in, but the open declaration of riches would have been a small human political suicide.
Millions of professional organisations are protesting with some tens of thousands of people, but it is the cause of thinking.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the harsh solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct heavenly gift.
When things have seemed to be rolling with their own weight for years, the associations are finally able to defend, manifestly and properly defend the rights of the worker.
This is how the government may want to condemn the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
We are no matter what the organizations think about, it is sad that the expression of Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment rises.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Target 8,5 million savings, personnel reduced by 130
The University of Lappeenranta begins a savings course with a view to reducing costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start the y-negotiations for the entire staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing approximately 130 workers.
In addition, two million are being saved.
The 2016 budget, which is expected to be 8.5 million deficits, is in the context of the Yt negotiations.
It is also affected by the cuts in the budget made by the government.
During this financial period, the university will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
Expenditure will grow slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around €85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding at our university is very important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University of Technology.
Before the summer, the effects seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with confidence officers will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to gradually open up to competition.
The first is close-town transport in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After short-distance transport, there will be long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
Ylen will be welcomed to the Ministry of Transport with the plans of Onnibus.
Other international companies have expressed their interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
With the US Central Bank the time of the interest-rate decision
The whole world will follow the US central bank Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible interest rate increase for the first time in almost a decade.
A fair half of the economists, who still believed the central bank would raise interest rates last week, are now cutting the central bank's outstanding interest rate at 0 to 0,25 % of the current survey by Reuters 80 economic scientists.
\"This is a historical situation, as the central bank has kept the interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus initiate normalisation of interest rates,\" said the Peterson Institute for International Economics Senior Researcher Angel Ubide.
The United States economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought back extra dollars in the balance sheet, and only increased inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation which is not as rose.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday 20:00 for Central Europe.
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague later on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message asking for the first murder and hoping she could cancel it, the authorities told me on Tuesday.
Lamb, teaching road and social science at the Gautier of Mississippi, Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday, he told me he shot a man.
In an emergency call, Lamb asked the police to go home.
I shot my wife last night, and Lamb told me, and she also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, and there's no harm to anyone but who's probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't tell me the motive for shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by her body and Lamb's hand, saying: \"I am very sorry and hope that I could withdraw my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.
The message was written by Lamb drove to Delta State University 500 kilometers, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before he took his life late on Monday when the police caught him.
The head of the university, William LaForge, told me that he was not aware of the Crusades between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that there was something clearly bothering Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb believed that Prentiss was also romantic in relation to Schmidt. However, on Tuesday, the authorities reported that there was no information or evidence of the triangle.
Shawn O'Ste, married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a human.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me he and Prentis have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
The man said that the daughter and mother were best friends.
Sun Herald says Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home by hand.
Knowles found out that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
He always wanted to help others, Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called the relatives during Monday and told them that she was not going to go to prison.
When the police reached Lamb Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled the foot, ran into the woods and took her own life.
According to a CV on the University's website, Lamb received a doctorate at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Embroidered stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (pictured with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also been struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that happened has really demanded its taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw side for months because of two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Championship league match against PSV Eindhoven.
The advocate will be disappointed to remain on the side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the field this period.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defence area in the bad taboo of Hector Moreno when the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw received first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
\"Shaw has two fractures on his leg, and he's in hospital,\" Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be moved to Manchester tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, for surgery.
The young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has experienced hardships and is now injured after the great games.
In the dress cabinet, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks from two points, he's on the side for half a month and he's not playing in the block.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed to be able to make a small difference when the situation did not follow the red card of the penalty.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
- You came to the conclusion yourself, but I think the situation was worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a two-legged hiccup.
Shaw's reference is like this: \"Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how upset I am.

The British defender has a particular reason to recover from the European Championship competition in France in June.
“This is a very serious injury, ” noted the PSV coach.
-In such injury situations, all parties are always very sorry.
The goal of the players is never to harm the opponent.
Moreno broke his legs playing in Mexico in the lines of Van Gaal's bulleted the Netherlands until the 2014 World Championships.
He's very sorry, because his intention was not to harm the opponent, but it's a shame to hear that the injury is serious, Cocu said.
I didn't see the situation.
All I saw was a ball going in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) was touching the ball, but I didn't see Luke's fight.
I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this can be, Moreno said to SBS6.
I feel really bad.
The PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smodelg.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Each parent notices before long that the child learns his favorite book almost outside.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the children's holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the 1971 Dr. Seuss teaching the environmental story.
In a text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. “Tarina is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I am happy to read it to my children, because there is always a picture or a message that we have never noticed before –
It sounds good, except for the next point where Cameron is to describe the plot of the book, there is a summary of the 2012 movie version, which added new characters and details to complete the short-term initial text.
In 1991, Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geesel, Ted, who wanted to get into Audrey's heart, having this greatest dream: to see the right tree, the text says. In 1991, Dr. Seussin, or Theodor Seuss Geesel, had no appeal.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly in line with the Lorax-picture on the Internet Movie Database site. It starts with: \"In the town of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is commercial, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get his dream into Audrey's heart...
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so strange to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys the wood and prepares them for the needs despite the resistance of the name character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, musty creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that a little press assignment like this is entrusted to an assistant, apparently someone who, as a child, has not read Lorax 20 times in a pipe.
The Prime Minister said that the text would probably come from Cameron's district office.
SuperCamps did not comment on this issue in more detail, but confirmed that the text was in the field of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being out of the UK team, but it's still tough.
Pakistan's encounter with the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but it is not expected that the last 3-0 Test series defeat of the team that we have selected for the tour of England will be repeated.
I wouldn't shut down a chance for a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experience in 2012, only young positiveness.
As a bally player, Moeen Ali develops as a tour feeder, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the UK Test team and replaced with Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously difficult for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven testimonies have been against two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that the critics are criticised according to the results.
Joe Root, for example, is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best voters.
A few 50-point fights should have been on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hit Yorkshire with more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his installation when he did not succeed as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team leader.
The question of how long the Test shooter gets the opportunity to impress is difficult.
Lyth received seven matches – as his predecessor, Sam Robson – while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest games.
The only point of appeal perhaps is that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in peak shape – but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's a hitter I appreciate high.
He's an unknown author of a cruise player we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea is that Moeen will start the pitch with Cook to get an extra spinner into the game while keeping four fast-eaters, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see no way of preventing a top eater from being in here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great crack player.
Moeen may not have had much in his local team in Worcestershire, but he has been a team trio player, and that is not a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test games before he could begin in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is a member of the team as a treasurer, and on the basis of what I have seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can view his statistics – an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher – and this can be a knockout, but a lot of spinsters have not shown themselves ready, and voters decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this game trip.
Outside the team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices to train its staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan hitter, the Mü chain Jayawarden, can be a breakthrough in the Test matches.
This is one of the most delicious men of the species, who brings with it a lot of experience because he has played in all kinds of circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball on the gambling trip and brings both energy and mercy.
I think he has always had an impact on the right international criticism, whether he plays a role as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, may be a spraying injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has been resting in one day's games, Root received a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
While not everyone agrees, trainers and voters do not set the game schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Camp Brexit can win if the economy is at a bad time in 2017
David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for the EU to remain in a deeper and deeper space, even without the choice of a pleasant Jeremy, or even a non-corbyniak, to lead the Labour Party or to mock Europe on Tuesdays.
In other lands, they have their own Corbyni and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises in the EU are at stake – although not everyone is doing their own thing – some Member States are tired of a British self-righteous agenda, which includes concessions that cause disagreement and harmful changes to the Treaty that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the TUC annual Congress concluded that they do not like the EU if it undermines social security.
We could call it Dave and George's self-evident agent.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor will, at summits and in bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-value people, return home and tell of their acquisition of allies for reforms.
Everything has to do with me.
My European friend, who wants to have a wide-sighted Britain inside the EU tent. - Don't leave us alone with France, Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capital cities have come to the point of not worrying about whether or not we are going to leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's rational Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the post before it rots, as has happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland is facing a re-election or successor's choice in 2017.
His power is sinking, too.
Poland may soon have a national right-wing government, while Spain will have a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them fighting to help selfie britts, who could better use their energy to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they don't want to, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately throw useless comments on Scotland's national party style in the UK's 2017 election campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The most recent negotiations had been organised.
The Europeans know how the British press will catch up and how the EU-sceptic oligarchistry is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, resulting in 2:1 joining the EU in 1973.
Someone may well remember Boris Johnson, a knife-like Euro-opportunist, who became known as our direct EU banana correspondent in Brussels at the beginning of the 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They include tax evasion, telephone hacking and apparent temporary costumes, which own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about the same thing, but then she realized that when she's in a cage with a rough gorilla, she's gonna have to spread the bananas to the dark so that you wouldn't be eaten by the gorilla for lunch and dinner.
Mr Blair was even more blared by his opposition to the referendum, and Blair admitted to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum 2005, Blair was able to obtain a good deal.
The press never forgave him for that.
But the nice Jeremy Corby who had killed me in the back of Westminster on Monday, and I told him that he had no time to waste on me. It might be a risk that he would use Neil Kinnock's media robot strategy from the '80s.
It may take some time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy to date the media. Not with me, but Andrew Marr, who, on the BBC-shoe, he sat on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to respond positively to this.
That's what Hilary-Benn, but not Bennite, said this week on radio and television, when his inner Boy Scout tried not to admit that it was a bad thing for Corbyn to call the Cark John McDonnell as the shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the '70s, when her old father had trouble being on TV with his unfavorable Labour colleagues, without going too far and not losing his place in the underroom.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU under all circumstances. McDonnel did not say that to his colleagues and underroom members in his private meeting on Monday night.
It is important for Corby to convey any beautiful picture that he even touched me. In the 24-7 period, it is important, especially in the discipline of the social media, where paranoid and fraud can be achieved.
Cameron does not need to give a free pass in relation to the EU, which would allow him to keep Labour's support self-evident in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins, that's what he thinks.
McDonnel and Corbyn's evivocation on EU membership is suitable for the island economy and the past against capitalism. The discussions are no longer just a small circle of left-wing dissidents, the idea of combining similarity is a key element of the doctrineal kahin.
There has also been an evolution in NATO. Tom Watson is unconvinced that Corby does not campaign for departure. Foreign diplomats have to try to clarify it in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be for nothing?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the terrible military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the operations of the Tory government.
Experts criticise the opinion of the British authorities on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims made by the government-funded institution that the smoking of electrical cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were born at a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise evidence from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health Service Public Health England (PHE) report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE described his report published last month as a reverse and comprehensive review of the results.
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The Lancet Medical Journal's advocacy was taken last month into the teeth, and the most important conclusion of the PHE is based on it.
In addition, two researchers have considered in BMJ whether the claims have been set up for “college or sand”,
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine European Professor of Public Health Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University Simon Capewell have stated: \"The basic assumption of public health is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness;
According to McKeen and Capewell, the large audience assumes that the PHE’s claim that, according to the current best estimate, electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes should be based on a detailed analysis and modelling of the results of the research.
The claim is based on a meeting of one of 12 people, which was called together for a multi-criteria decision analysis model. The model wanted to bring together the views of the participants on the adverse effects of nicotine products. The results were collected in the study.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the group supported EuroSwiss Health, whose previous independent investigation by the CEO has, according to sources, funded by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, in the report on sustainable activities, the Executive Director expressed his support for BAT’s activities in accordance with public health.
However, one of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from an electro-acid producer, who claimed to have financed the tobacco company Philip Morris International, did not grant it.
There is no explanation of the selection criteria for the composition of the panel, but there are a number of well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which are admitted to the industry as a financier.
However, some of the participants are not known about their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco manager.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the study report of the group shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the harmful effects of the products, with a large proportion of the products and their criteria being met.
However, the PHE report does not mention connections or shortcomings.
According to the PHE report, so far no evidence has been provided that electric cigarettes can promote smoking for children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider that the claim is premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's head of health and well-being, these claims have been answered in the past.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than conventional smoking.
Every other person who smoke through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electrical cigarettes are lower than the risks of conventional tobacco; however, the long-term effects need to be studied more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens what evidence indicates and what it does not indicate, particularly in a situation where relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, nearly 80 000 deaths are reported annually, and smoking costs public health around 2 billion pounds per year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the present evidence that electronic cigarettes are not an unrisk option, but the damage they cause is a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
According to Channel 4, Luke Johnson has stated that the BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand on the hitisries, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, licence fees should only be used for programmes that are not performed by other television stations.
He criticised the BBC for presenting programmes likely to be lower than the public at the same time as the large audience programmes of competitors and, for example, on the BBC4 channel.
When Tony Hall, President of the BBC, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to cooperate with the BBC, without the results.
\"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC will buy formats and send programmes that would clearly be part of some competing channel software,\" Johnson told the Parliament's Committee on Communications, which explained the future of BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep a public broadcasting fee, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply to programmes which are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC will send The Voice to its best viewing time, as it will want the broadest possible support in the future.
If there's no other channel to worry about the program, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
\"I do not understand why the aggressive tax should finance programmes that could be funded without subsidies,\" said Johnson.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders second, even though it is its own production.
Many channels would give their right hand out of it.
I don't understand how this works for the broadcasting company's services.
I don't think these would be lost to the BBC.
Johnson is a serial company led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, and he believes that BBC has requested good ratings because they work for ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to that of the former Sky-pomon Tony Ball, who suggested in 2003 with his MacTagart lecture that BBC sells series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC’s niche programmes are displayed on BBC4, where viewers are often not able to measure, but the programs fulfil their purpose.
\"BBC presents them at times when no one ever sees them,
Of the public radio charges, Johnson said: “I am calling for you to find another system in the same sense that is old-fashioned, who will benefit the best.
Everyone, of course, thinks it's worth $150 a year, but people to whom it's a big sum, especially if it's not just looking at the BBC.
David Elstein, former Director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also expressed his views in committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions with new information, learn and entertain –
According to Elstein, at the current offer of BBC, there is hardly any educational programmes – 1 percent on television and 0.1% on radio.
To the question of cooperation, Mr Elstein suggests that the BBC could add consignments, for example, from events such as the Proms festival, whose concerts were sent only a fraction last year.
The brain cells can be controlled with sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how to change the shuttle mat in its direction when the ultrasounds are applied to them.
Researchers have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically altered, thus controlling worms with ultrasound.
Small shuttle worms change their direction by targeting an ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing area of the ear of man.
The sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified to have a transport film that reacts to ultrasound.
Further topic: Researchers monitor brain activity through light
According to researchers, the effect of the new sonogenetics method (dubbed sonogenetics) was demonstrated on the worms. In the process, ultrasound is used to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an irritancy from outside the body.
Researcher Sreekant Chalasani, California, La Jolla, told Guardian that one day the method can replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s symptoms, where the brain is stimulated with electrical pulses.
The shuttle worms do not normally react to ultrasound. However, Chalasan noticed that worms are beginning to react when they are placed in a liquid with a microscopic small bubble.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles strengthen the ultrasonic waves that enter the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of worm cell membranes.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, the sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttles with ultrasonic sound, Chalasan genetically altered the worms so that some of the nerves that directed their movement appeared to the TRP4 ionics.
When ultrasonic was directed to the altered worms, the microcubes strengthened the sound waves and moved to the worms, and the nerve cell started the signal.
The method resembles a little optogeneic, which is a transforming tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells by light.
According to Chalasan, sonogenetics, however, have certain advantages compared to optics.
The light is directed to the brain under investigation using light fibers. The low - speed ultrasounds instead pass the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be guided into the brain through the skull.
\"We believe that genetic therapy and viral therapy can temporarily expose human nerve cells to ultrasonic signals in certain neurological treatments,\" said Chalasan.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and in cells that produce insulin.
It's illegal torture - at your door!
Advertising is a disgrace to British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International Anti-armed Mass Video.
Hardening killer missiles!
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Grapefruits!
Remote magnets that cause irresistibly pain but do not leave a trace!
The video is made by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British administration's desire to sell weapons to the resolution governments at the Security and Defence DGEI (Dephence Security and Equipment International) fairs, which are held at the ExCel Fair in Docklands, London.
More information: DSEI Stations: Autoritorial Administrations arrive in London
Buspikes and subways also feature posters demanding another look.
\"Exception: Do you move on a subway between 15 and 8 August – The notification reminds you of the London metro announcements.
In September, a group of arms dealers arrive at Docklands.
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who had worked at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
The collection, called Special Patrol Group, contributed to the distribution of posters around London with a six-pound advertising hacking package, which claimed to be available for approximately a third of the advertising posters of world bus stops.
Transport for London does not make a poster of vandalism laugh.
One of the pranks of the Special Patrol Group.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and teacher at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question matters and want to bring their political work to the public to see outside the galleries.
The artists have noticed that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world, and many are also moving to work with Protestant activists.
Another anti- arms trading poster greets users of public transport on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the author have also done their work without compensation.
The artistic director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was in a state of absence and an empty spot in ExCeL's event calendar.
They tried to get rid of a more realistic, cloudy corporate video, but bright colors and animation are more important.
“They’ve done a great job and helped us raise up the mass of illegal torture equipment, ” says Tom Davies.
\"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not illegally traded at our home door.
However, the most creative antiquity of the weapons fairs is presented themselves in exCeL exhibition halls, where the actors use the huge circular expressions of their trade goods.
In his press release, Saab announced an order by the US Army for \"the applicable AT4CS RS\".
The product includes a special-shaped warhead, which effectively penetrates directly into the target.
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in student housing
I moved to the student apartment 11 years ago. I was innocent when I was 19 years old and I still believed in barettes and moral relativisms.
The most important lessons I can make can be summed up to eight simple rules.
The move to the apartment is the most distressing experience and most shocking.
The situation is easy to say: tell everyone where you are, whether you like it or not, and why you like Corbyn and why you don't really hate or love Marmite, because it's just a glitch, a hahahahahaha, I'm in my room,
Just take a breath.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other things.
Questioning leads you to a conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when you were in the scenes and these people were sharing fuses.
Give the others some space.
The private rooms often act as drinking sticks, movies theatres and general living rooms, but their own room is also a place where to dress from underwear.
More about: Don’t even think about dating and university studies
For Introvertes, the university is a tough place.
The room should be a place for calming down. However, many flats form a social culture that travels from room to room and forms life-long friendship relationships.
Such culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: \"I like you and want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can download back the energy I used to date with you,
Try to see if someone from your college friends is exhausted from social contact, and maybe you shouldn't knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my own student apartment who thought the locked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Get some friends with a bake.
You start your study properly when the bakery is in, so if you bake brownies and knock someone at the door, you don't seem like a 50th, a little weird case:
Homemade sweets are a great way to make new friends.
Your student friend has no choice but to talk to you, and thanks to the surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bakery from you.
If you serve poor flour, sugar and greasy cookers, the others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Irrigation of food is also a common defect in student housing.
Of course, stealing another chicken is stealing, but can you pour your tea out of someone else's milk can?
Always make sure the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get a permit, even if the milk loan is also the owner of your jar.
I understand very well that it's annoying if you get something from someone, but try to deal with it as adultly as possible – unlike my own study partner who's been looting his milk detergent as a punishment for dairy thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't be silly when others try to sleep or push.
It's not just that it's polite, it's also worth remembering that anyone else's hole is digging...
In my own apartment, a girl asked the person who lived next door to adjust the music to a smaller one, for it was three in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally got quiet in the neighborhood, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she left for three hours for the exam, left the music to go to her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate happened to move into the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be weird if you thought first that your college friend was your next mate, you'd start dating, divorce, and have to see him every day, and lose the right to meet your friends?
The heart, of course, wants what it wants, and if the college mate isn't absolutely the only one right, try to control it.
If you find out at a time when you're a biker, that someone has forgotten his keys to a room whose door hasn't been locked, the limit for tricking and bullying is more subtle than they could think.
It's a good joke, but it's the kind of one that's gonna get better in no time.
Hide some object may be a valuable and funny teaching, but no one's room should be messy with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door of another room can lock and drop the keys into the glass of water, which is placed in the freezer, but do not place any goods in the ceiling with a blue bar a few times more.
Racist attack on Kitee - House designed for reception in Salo
On Saturday morning a racist blow was made to the residence of foreign students in Kitee, northern Karelia.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation of minor asylum seekers but the sleep facilities of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period, says Heidi Lukeen, a teacher of the Kite Evanelinen folk school.
The windows and walls of the public college accommodation were pushed with racist signs, such as carvings, and a metal object was thrown through a single accommodation window, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luke, as a responsible teacher of youth guarantee education, there were estimated ten people at the time of the attack in the building under vandal control.
\"There was a weekend and there were adults who were free to move, so some could be elsewhere,\" Luke says.
The National School has accommodation in 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in a connected building have a status.
Some study in adult education, some in vocational studies, and some study Finnish, ” Luke says.
A status is a permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finnish police are investigating the attack as a damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, students received an information conference on Monday, with the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had foreign students for another decade, and this is the first time something like this happens,\" Luke says.
Luke says the mess's already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have had at least three men and had been on the move with a light passenger car.
I think this is the end of the youth weekend when this topic has been on the ground.
Nothing more serious, Luke says.
There's also been a hospital in Salo with a designated reception centre.
It happened last week.
He told me about it on his website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall had a carvingist drawn and written in English “You are not welcome ”
There's been a criminal record for the police.
Amendment 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected information on the age and status of the persons living in the building, given by the police.
The state will break down the Y train to the Karjaa - passengers in their filth, the old idiot countries -
The Y train from Helsinki to Karjaa from Raasepor will cease to run in March.
The news was agitated by passengers rising from the beginning of the train at Helsinki Main Railway Station.
In particular, there is a downward attack on the islanders, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's very idiotic because the number of residents is growing all the time, and the workplaces need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be up to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on a video interview with HSTV he'll be coming on a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
H- and R-trains running on the main track are connected to the new R-line.
Purola's position in Järvipää and Nuppylinna in Tuusula is absent.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes the Ministry of Transport to buy train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period varies year-on-year and the end-of-year routes are all over the country.
The new four-year agreement in autumn will be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a Siuntiian, considers that the state of the train cutting is a short-sighted operation.
We are making the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y train is also used by people other than the Raaseporians and the Siuntio people, because it is fast and bypasss several positions.
On the train, the Espolainen Annina Pöyry was agitated by the fate of travelers from the urban area.
“It is especially sad for those who have to redesign their journey, ” he said when he was on the Y train.
A little relief is in place.
I think a new train connection to the beach track is coming to replace the Y-jun in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, i.e. to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities and taxpayers in the region.
“We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices, ” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year on the Y train, the Ministry has paid much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves two positions between us.
Instead, in Ainola and in the sauna kallio the number of train lines will double.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease in the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys rail traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keurou and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinajoki.
The Piesämäki Joensuu route is reduced to the Pieksämäki route.
The trains are reduced along the routes of Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips are made in permanent shifts a year, with some nine million journeys being purchased in total by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million per year to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on the state of the capital: \"It is worth studying for Marx.
The global economic crises have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his conclusions from 1867 to 1894 in the capital, writes the current status of the capital of Marx in the book Yrjö Hakane, the former President of GDP.
He'll be taken more seriously now than long ago. Hakanen will write in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the evolution, internationalisation and intrusion of capitalist economies have proved to be amazing for all areas of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of capital and imaginary capital.
The list of the capital seminar-based books organised by Hakasen is also published in Aalto University, Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected economic operator.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's being a topical girl and forever,
However, it is not the former Managing Director of the Institute of Economic Research and Economic Affairs, is it Marxian?
No, no, no, no.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather as an interesting society theory.
Today, social sciences have become diverse and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economicist, journalist, political agitator and lesson in literature.
The common idea is that the atheory tells us about the wrong opinions of the dead men, Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions of capitalism from the early season too far, Korkman wondered.
But Korkma sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
\"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked me some good questions,\" he says.
Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth, are now being discussed again.
“Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a large picture, as a result of a technical upheaval, to a changing world, ” he analyses Korkma.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't helping Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Korkman thinks he should be familiar with it.
\"In the '70s Marx couldn't read,\" Korkman says.
\"The Mao and the Trotski people and the other sects hated all capitalism, but even more so,
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political pressure on the back years.
Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like any other classics, says Korkman.
The UN calls on war offenders in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamils.
The civil war in Sri Lanka is estimated to have died at least 100,000 people.
There is no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major armed attack in the last months of the long war should be properly investigated in 2009, and the UN report calls for.
Sri Lankan armed forces report on torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, as likely as men as women.
According to the report, rebels have committed themselves to coercion of minors and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intended to organise an investigation itself, but it does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
In the Yoo-Kennia trial, he was able to put his social media on the table.
The syksy student books had a long foreign language on Wednesday, which most of them had English.
More than 16,000 volunteers tested their English skills.
The test could have written a substance on social media.
Based on its own experience, it was necessary to consider whether the social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the article of 150-250 words in English may have been shown to the editor of the website’s advisory gallery.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for Finnish Leelia resting chair.
He had to ask how parents should look at things from the point of view of young people too.
The total amount of the substance was four, one of which had to be selected.
“It was the hardest of them, ” estimated the third topic by Mia Lybeck, a Swedish-language high school in Porvoo.
The third issue was just a sitat from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, Lybeck said it was nice.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
- At least in our school we've been practicing to write speeches, Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment as normal.
During a test in Finland - or in Swedish - we were able to answer questions about texts that, for example, called for the adaptation of the summer chamber to climate change and the processing of large information masses.
On Wednesday, a small amount of Russians were also written (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The articles of autumn continue on Friday, when there is an experiment of another domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In upper secondary schools, the test is normally carried out, i.e. the expression of the employees does not affect it.
The Board of Studies invites experimentants to find suitable transport connections in time for them to get to the test.
Even more time can be given if it can be shown that the delay did not result from lack of care.
The shop in Oulu was robbed with a gun on it.
In Oulu, Wednesday morning the shop was robbed in the town of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and was wearing a commando box covering his face.
He's a normal body and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating this as a gross robbery.
Police are preparing to arrive at tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland
The government's anti-circumvention demonstration will be blocking the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary reports, up to tens of thousands of people may arrive.
The members of the SAK, A Plan and STKK associations will meet at Rautatientor at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in demonstrations.
In turn, the police at work are not only responsible for the tasks of alarming and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the giant expression.
Roads to the train sensor shall be closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30 a.m. to 14.
Only alarm vehicles will be released in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from the traffic circle of Kaisaniemi, from the western direction of Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, it seems to be enough.
I'm not taking a stand for police struggles.
Helsinki, according to Kujala, is coming to Finland because of the demonstration of mentality.
The police won't tell us the exact number of patrols.
There's a lot of coming, but basically we're gonna be fine on our own, Kujala says.
The police are asking to avoid private caring in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic gap extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to early evening.
With protesters arriving from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them to the Rautatientor.
Buses are, as a matter of fact, a long way away.
The rest of the trip then has to walk to the scene of protest, Kujala tells me.
The expression of the mind also stops the public transport in Helsinki.
From the police' point of view, there's a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large gatherings, is now taking care of itself.
The demonstration organisers have informed the police that tens of thousands of government opponents in economic policy may be in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the expression of mind to go smoothly.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are reasonable and peaceful, says Kujala.
On Friday, local demonstrations are also held in different parts of Finland.
In many ways, the expression of Friday's mind is exceptional - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations of mind?
The great expression of mind organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiinen, Professor of Sociology of Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Sisitainen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's strong ideas are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here to make sure that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, mirrors are needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
This new division is now the sharp distribution that the expression of mind will bring about among those who would be willing to take part in the demonstration.
Unemployed persons who met across Finland showed their views at Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you were looking for a reference point for a Friday's demonstration, it could be a huge demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorsta, 1993, says Siisiinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorsta gathered 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (centre) government is complicating from the labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as that of the Ahon portvari government.
Now, perhaps even worse between the government and the Ay movement than the time of Murrostorsta.
Furthermore, Finland is now very powerful in the history of the Portuguese Government, Sisisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in that way that it is so strict in spite of the basic Finnish speeches.
At that time, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protestors are expected on Friday.
The expression of the mind also stops public transport and possibly closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive the unallocated support of employees, it can become the largest in years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year in recent years.
They're on the edge.
Traditionally, Finnish ay movement's demonstrations have been quite peaceful - although the way things have been going down in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is subject to law.
The mindmakers are trying to avoid damage to or destruction of property, says Sisinen.
The late 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes, among other things, by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikees and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical ceiling in the 1970s
The most important strike in the 1970s was the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and power strike in 1977.
The metalman strike was attended by 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended after seven weeks after the strike was presented by the Conciliation Committee.
Metal men got a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 electricity ceiling lasted 49 days and caused electrical shocks all over the country.
Murrostorist in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people met in the Parliamentary House, many of them as unemployed, to show their minds in favour of work.
Firemen strike three months in 1998
The firemen strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless it was the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in egg smoke in the protests of farmers against the EU in 1994.
“Siberia teaches, the EU quits, there was one of the attacks.
For Espa, farmers took tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hayballs in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995.
The nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
Last time they were in the strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was painted by some deaths during the strike.
Make your threats to the strike and the mass transplants of nurses in 2007.
In the end, the negotiations accelerated the threat of mass migration.
Doctors lacquered 2001
- Doctors in the strike - for the escape - included a strike clause for law enforcement doctors in 2001.
The municipal health centre and hospital doctors’ strike lasted five months and brought about a lively debate on how law enforcement can jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students marching for student support in Helsinki from the Senate Hall to Parliament Hall in 2013.
Central Crime Police to find out the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to identify the backgrounds of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and main responsibility are at the event site in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more likely to experience a more fatal impact.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died apparently by choking.
According to the General Radio, which first told the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company conducts, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign-based, 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for the smuggling of human beings.
Captain, ex-conspirator of the refugees and upskirt businessman - story of five smugglers.
Upporid king of smugglers, violent boat driver, an elegant missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks himself to be a good guy.
Such people, for example, engage in human trafficking in the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of trento, and a journalist, Gampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their clients, and their book Death Travel Office will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the lonkers of trafficking in human beings, present suggestions for solutions and present smugglers at different stages of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them off right now.
The Kikenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunishans are heading there for summer entertainment.
On behalf of their location, islands are also excellent for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometers.
Because of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, the captain who burns in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kikenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
It is done by Emir on a blue, ten-metre tree, hundreds of times already.
If I'm going to fill the ship's feathers, I'm going to put 40 people in it.
One trip to Emir makes about 8 000 euros after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for her clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunishers wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis came again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Island in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as he can see.
Food is given in such a way that customers just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the client is out of money, it is their problem.
We're going out to the water at midnight with a quenched lantern.
The first night we drive off the island, then stop, wait the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the high waves of 20 metres passengers weep and vomit.
At the destination, human cargo has been landed in half an hour and Emir leaves for a return trip.
Emir wants to be scared.
That's why he beats up his clients, and at least claims he's gonna beat up the hangers' lives.
He says in the book that when the police suddenly caught him, he threw all his passengers across the side and told them to swim to the nearest island.
\"I took the clients out of the neck one by one, and I threw them over the edge,\" says Emir in the book.
The most irony passengers are coming from the southern side of Sahara.
I hear that his countrymen have to take this to heart.
I'm gonna beat them off right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular cab driver in Bogojiša, Serbia.
His cab's not very good, the starter's been pulling in the last few days and, by the way, it's seen his best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at the top and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogojisha is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
Near the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their family will stay in tents, ponds and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
The forest also includes families who have not submitted asylum applications for reasons or for others to Serbia.
Some also live in private homes, but it is a public secret.
From among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walking in a difficult country, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arrived in the Bogojisha area, on the knot of the great trafficking in human beings, the people are dying tired.
The people of Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians. He'll tell you in the book.
They say it once, and that's enough, Goran.
He said the Africans are trying to make a move.
That's not what Goran likes.
You've got a stupid loo all the way.
The first agreement is a price of EUR 300, then they count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses he's a nice, kind-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he works at a cheaper rate than the others and that he or she has to pay for the Hungarian border for only 50 euros.
There are three hundred kilometres of the trip, most of which are comfortable on the highway.
I hear colleagues ask for three or four times the price.
Goran deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a big deal for the smuggler, but in Serbia it's a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and he takes his passengers off the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and cheers away.
In the Work of Proverbs
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary embassies, and that's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many Christians who have fled Congo, as well as a small center to help the Congolese refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks to do the work of mercy.
It's important to look good to the missionary.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and takes care that the white calf’s rubber strip scours gently under the low belt of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his underground car and three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and from Europe.
At first, the customer calls some of the five telephone numbers of the Consignor.
He advises that it be worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in a whiff, and that it blends with merchants across the border.
In order to get a asylum seeker or refugee status to the Ugandan authorities, we must tell them that we have come from, for example, North Kivu war areas and that we have been forced to flee from their home violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity card will be destroyed and another one will be obtained.
That will help the Missionary Officer's contacts with the Ugandan police.
After this, the customer is directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum, NGOs, the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows red tape because he himself has become a refugee to Uganda.
He will charge each gate separately: the submission of an application to the Ugandan police will cost about 100 euros, the delivery of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process, for example, to some European countries, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice-creams
Tom's a start-up smuggler, a former drug dealer.
Fourty-six Irish call on the French coast in Calais, where his work is to load people into the streets on the way to Britain.
He's got an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know he's in the human secret transport business.
At night Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from some nearby downtown Calais.
They're driving A26, trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would have to go directly to prison for illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The cab stops, Tom and his clients running across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before they continue to cross the canal across the Britts.
Tom chooses a suitable truck to make sure it's on his way to England, not even the Netherlands, and cuts the line between a safety-belt and a safety-belt.
It's gotta be done quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom will wrap his client in an aluminium foil, the same one that is wrapped in a kitchen around a fryer or an oven potato.
It's supposed to stop the police's thermal scanner from seeing the hideout.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom's leaving his client's truck, and he's out of town hoping that you don't have to go on a shady ride, at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
Upporical Turkish is called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal land in the Mediterranean that controls sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, the Cyçuk has been working and has constantly developed new ways of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage vis-à-vis other entrepreneurs: he only needs the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury cruise: Turkish ports are leased according to entertainment shops to take Americans or European families to tourist trips for a few days.
The reality is that ships are loaded to the Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported from Istanbul to one of the ports and from there to sea in Europe against a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls until they leave.
I'll get people into minibuss and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we have to get on board quickly.
Passengers have to stay hidden under deck.
The guard can only observe how deep the ship is, for no other sign of the human population is visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and throw up, the better.
Küçuk receives about 53 000 euros from one luxury trip after the cost.
He does not deal with practical things himself, but employs captains, recruiters, guards, captors and other smaller factors to take care of the work in turn.
During the summer season transports are organised for at least hundreds of people and millions of people make money.
He is thought to have bought land through undercover companies, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Mr Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical industry.
He must have disappeared since then.
Correction from 16.9.2015 at 15.10 a.m. on this, not next week.
American Olympics in their book Disorder and Prostitution
Three times at the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 500-metre runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl's book, Favor Hamilton tells about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published some bitter books on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the race in peak condition and ran in the cartilage for the second best time.
In the finals, however, he panicked.
At the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position on the ground run.
However, at 150 meters before the goal, his strength was subdued.
He fell on the track surface, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself across the finish line, Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Fabor Hamilton suffered from a double mood disorder.
His brother, Dan, had done a year before Sydney’s race to commit suicide, and he himself felt tremendously successful.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There was no economic problem, but he was delighted by the idea of having money to have sex with strangers.
He also overreacted with his husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's cab was 450 euros per hour.
He tells me that he spent the money on his luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of being a prostitute was also that he needed adrenaline scale similar to that he had won in his competition for public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from a double mood disorder.
The double life of the former spirit came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was in the world's statistical community at 1,500 metres, at 3.57.40, but remained the last one at the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was glad when the union put the Norwegian ski resort in hand:
The Norwegian ski club Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability, in the opinion of at least one of its colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have, like the last year of the summer and autumn, turned into a sports agreement.
Although Northug has been offered a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the world champion and the Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to close Northug out of the future World Cup.
The decision received thanks for the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski resort under control.
Thank you for showing me the spine, Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor, he continued.
The dispute between Norway and Northug is about money.
Apparently Northug would like to be part of a period of national team so that he can advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations, and will not give one athlete to the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that Northug has been given economic and other privileges for many years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own release in which he assured himself that he wanted to be brave in Norwegian colors during the next season of World Cup, as well as after World Cup and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MMs, two of which are gold.
He was involved last winter in the team that won the media gold.
The racing day of pasturers is also celebrated in the North
On the 25th day of the race, there will be a set of paces in various restaurants and shops that have been granted the shield of the Paist translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-level food skills and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants checked and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of the increased sense of the thyroid and organization.
In the northern part of the day the restaurant is held in Vaasa in Fondiks and Kantareliks.
In Kokkola, there is a restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events that will take place in different parts of the world within the same day.
Finland will continue to be the host country.
Kahajoki newspaper: Appeals to the Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of the Kahava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of Kauhava’s ex-space currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area is still permanently located in the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is in the hands of the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Special Networks Oy.
According to the Kajokoki newspaper, the placement of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in connection with the area and airport of the former Airport School, whose impact has also not been explained in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
The article states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
It has been discussed, among other things, by Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
The Ombudsman is told by a private person that the complaint is not a question of the principle of the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned location in the former military area is wrong.
The Kahava City Government dealt with the reception centre issues last Monday.
Niinistry: The situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented in the evening to journalists after meeting with the chairmen of all parliamentary parties in Mänttyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were shared by all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland the government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in times where we face great challenges
The so-called ‘Syria’, as well as Russian and US activities in the region, may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistries are desirable in terms of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive way, namely the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the report, the NATO issue was also ignored in the discussions.
In the labour market situation, the President did not take a stand.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights, start off for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia states that the operations of airports are intended to be carried out by the commanding forces during the stop-of-work.
However, there are safety checks and other service points that are expected to be affected by such delays and delays.
The demonstration closes the streets of the centre of Helsinki
Friday's demonstration closes the streets of the Helsinki Centre.
The police tell us that the streets leading to the Rautatientor are closed from the cars around 9:30-14.
There are no cars allowed from the direction of the Mannerheims in the direction of Kaivokata, Postikatu and the Gulf of Work towards the railway station.
The direction of Hakaniemi from the Union road is directed to the Union Street in the context of the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people taking part in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles shall be allowed to enter the area.
Metro and Ratty Drivers in All Friday's demonstration of mind
Metro and tram drivers take part in the demonstration of Friday from the beginning of the morning traffic to the end of the night traffic.
The Raitio and Metro staff association told STT about it tonight.
Most of the Alps are closed for two hours, including mail closed
Friday’s demonstration also causes disturbances for Post’s services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, to distribute day mail.
The majority of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is handled despite the strike.
The aim is also to manage food transportation and hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
You can obtain information on the situation on the services on the Post website.
Most of the Finnish Alps close their doors on Friday for two hours.
Pam, the Trade Union of Services, has instructed its employees to suspend their work between 11 and 13.
Pam has also called on day-care workers to participate in professional demonstrations.
SOK's and Kesko's representatives tell Helsingin's Sanitaries that the stores are to be kept open, if necessary, by the commanding forces.
According to Kesko, the possible closure of individual stores is not yet known.
The day-care centres in Helsinki are partially closed
The day-care centres in Helsinki are not fully operational on Friday, informs the Helsinki Early Education Agency.
Due to professional demonstrations, day care is possibly concentrated in certain day care centres, and day care is not organised by day care centres and playgrounds.
Day-care centres around the globe and groups of developing disabled and disabled children remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of developing disabled and autistic schoolchildren will be carried out normally.
The Agency's authorisation to notify the changes to its activities will be updated tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Take a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio calls are one channel among others.
Such direct talk channels will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipiba did not wish to assess yet how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio calls would become.
According to the Sipilä, speech may not always be forwarded to Ylen channels in the future.
If other channels are reported to be a channel, then we'll see.
We're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the economic situation in Finland is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to be made to the public.
This dossier, which is now being discussed, is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The call will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
Take a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's TV speech will not be about turning the government in.
Is it an effort to take more strictly into account the right to define a public debate and to refuse a public debate on the questions raised by Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm?
The Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin recently commented that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to be defined.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be connected.
It is understood that the commercial media is nervous about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting issues in democracy.
It is the responsibility of the media to make a specific effort to ensure that the political agendas are not taken into account.
It says that TV calls are a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations put on the table.
Is there more that we've heard today?
Or can he speak differently, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if the promise is just the same as the old one, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
Ylekin takes this risk in the sense that, if this is not a specific situation, it is a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be identified as a message from politicians or parliament and government, which will certainly not be in the interest of Ylen or in the general direction.
Sliding the door bet
In the future talk, it is also important what the Prime Minister leaves without saying, and the media researcher stresses.
Tonight you will have to look closely to what Sipilä is missing and to what it is not, says Heikki Kutti, research coordinator of Jyväskylä University.
The six say that TV is a smart bet from Sipi, because this is how this gets us to get his own view out of the ringtone.
This will give a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at an information conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The sympathies pass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that there is something wrong with the media, because no specific questions can be asked.
The moon says it's very important to see how Sipilä goes on TV... if the sweats run out, if your hands shake.
He compares Sipi to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good point, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to be informed about something, because here man is as if he speaks directly to another person.
This is what (President Barack of the United States) Obama and his partners regularly engage in.
It's very exceptional.
Mr Erkka Railo, a political scientist, considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional for the citizens.
According to him, it has not been for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time calls for extraordinary means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that this is what the Prime Minister wants to bring Finnishs to their sympathy for the tensions ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations organise demonstrations and strike against government action.
On Twitter, President of the Left, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipila could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed as well.
Ms Rinne (St.), president of the SDP, also announces that he has an interview with the Sipila dialogue.
We don't have time for monologists.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time we found him.
THE son's father updated his Facebook site.
The Finnish Police Department will also confirm the case to the Bay of Eastern Finland.
The kid went out four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was never contacted again.
My father thanked everyone who's been looking for help.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent devastation of young people: You can hate it.
The Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which appeals particularly to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani had to speak against young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland at the age of five, has so far won both professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amitarkhani tells me he received a message asking to check out an Instagram account.
There have been video downloads of young people fighting with extreme violence.
My Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the youth's wild.
26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the ground, sit on the other one, and strike them with no eye on without thinking about any of the consequences of this, when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people in the videos are immigrants.
Jarmo Heinonen, Commissioner of the Helsinki Police, said that fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and by Finnish youths.
It's specifically that you're fighting the other side of the street.
You make it so much harder for many other immigrants to live here in Finland, the Turk Amikhani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds me that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite gross.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be quite a long time guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, Amikhani says.
Amirkhani invites young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the object of some racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go into this kind of thing, guys.
My Amirkhani says that violent activity is giving rise to racism.
You guys make me hate what I don't like.
You're in a pretty bad mood anyway, and that's not going to cure them, Amikhani will decide.
SAK will put its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, President Lauri Lyly, SAK's president, says that the employees' organisation will consider its position on Monday on an alternative list of savings.
Lauri Lyly commented on STKK's proposal on Twitter.
In the past, STKK informed the Government of its proposal to reach the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) on Wednesday.
The programme president, Mr Fjäder, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STK and Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest payer organisation, the SAK, should reduce its previous position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, president of the SAK, commented on the issue in a dire way on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open up the labour market lock, and the status of forced labour laws requires agreements by active parties.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipila's Government's proposal for a social agreement did not qualify the SAK.
In the past, the Sipilä cut off the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAA refused to commit itself to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: A big demonstration is threatening to go west - I feel like it's a bit funny to pick up a fist.
You know, I feel like it's a little funny to put on a fist, if there's an apocalypse in your pocket, write on Peggy Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in the employee camp.
Is it supposed to call the government abrogation, or should it agree?
On Monday, the Federal Directors of the SAK broke out sacred hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut up.
The threat spread to the intended ones, too.
OAJ threatened to close schools and day-care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) chairman of STKK, the Staff Centres' Organisation, appeared amicably.
He reported that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing the alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) for a 5% productivity break.
The president of the plan, Mr Fjäder (kok), rushed to announce that his contract paper was ready.
At first, the SAK's office didn't belong to a yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (Sd) is difficult to reach out to when the allies just on Monday ordered the earth to stand on Friday.
Finally, Lyly announced that the SAC Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAC would seek solutions to open up the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept the 5% productivity margin as a target.
No wonder the STKK of Palola has a good relationship with the government of Sipilä.
The right hand of Palola, Head of the STKK Social Impactor Jukka vinus, previously acting as Special Representative of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire also described that the government's ay-skills have been improved all the time.
Incident or not, but Palola's output was slightly off from Finnish hosts, whose photo of the wedding was Marko Rajainen (sd).
You know, I feel like it's a little funny to put on a fist if there's an matching paper in his pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: \"This must not happen again,\"
President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, feels that Mongolia is better than the OSCE father in Finland.
In Mongolia's capital Ulan Bator, a guilt meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Festival.
In that case, Finland did not allow the entry of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced by the European Union to attend a meeting - a matter which the President repeatedly reminded journalists of.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This can't happen again. Naryshkin stressed the news agency according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only by Finland and the EU but also by the United States, where his access had been blocked.
Sants are a political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
The Russian delegation in Mongolia was complex, so Naryshkin continued to blink in Finland with praise and thanks for the special organisation of Mongolia.
I am sure that Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with positive results, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
Mongolia's leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue does not involve obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanervan (kok) leading the Ulan Bator meeting, which, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian délegation.
The lock meets the true playoff mirror:
The killer and the Luk continue today at Hakamets bull days while both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicted that today at Hakametsa we will not see a real goal party.
The killer went to Kuopio yesterday to take out a 3-and-time win from KalPa.
The rise was masculine, because last season the silver team was at its worst from the defeat position of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was more than a bull's-eye.
The Iron Island as a guest of the Blues that started as a guarantee was a round zero point, and the defeat readings were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Lukku shocker Janne Lahti anticipates settings on the club's pages.
The killer has formed quite a playoff nightmare for the raumas.
In fact, during the last two periods, Tappara has just dropped the final series of Lukko in the middle.
On both floors, the solution has been called for by a decisive seventh mate.
In the last season, Lukuk took the series to a loss already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next breasts and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups, except for goal restraints.
The cashiers who fought both yesterday will be getting a peak today.
With the goal of killing, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhus, and between Lukuk and Lukuk, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: A terrible play going on in the music
Toivila, the Sports Director, wrote the main coach to Rautakallio a non-compatible extension, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a movie on Rocky where he was acting the main part.
The subservient censored the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Evoila wrote a soft ash story in Pori.
The nameless and wood-cuffed pastry went to all astonishment to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough, underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the iroquoises.
Hope became a blonde.
A fine TV browser, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The ace took a winning silver.
Hopela was one of the heroes.
Doctor Toivila believes that the novelty work of this period will work in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as an Aussie sports director has built a stand for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been dumping waste in the far end like Rocky pig meats at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than in a game with a gypsum.
Hopela has forgotten that, at Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Peggy Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi is crucified by the Sea Connery of Rautakallion.
Rautakallio is a leading performer of the most clumsy in Tovoila’s script, Rocky, as if Connery had been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing else in the Iron Hall than Rocky's favorite name.
The game philosophy of the Rautakallion is not part of running and running.
He appreciates a tough game, but there's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Aussie Garrett Stafford jacketed Tapparan to Jere Karjalainen's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judge, but Rautaallio put a man in a shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't accept that kind of game, and it's not part of the ace hat, the hot-headed Rautakallio woke up after the game to the people of Satakunta.
This season's team is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen, and assaulters.
There are virtually no key men at best.
It's no wonder the head coach's been complaining about a craftsman.
How much have you been able to influence players' acquisitions, Peggy Rautakallio?
The events of the last period have affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, and Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface.
The 1953 model of Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to a sports bomb in the city of Toivola.
The men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces over the three leagues of the season is equal to the loss of the goal difference of 1-6.
It would not have been worth writing a copy.
Olga Temone plays The Mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband, Tuuka, when she was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temone is in charge of her husband for the first time.
Yeah, I'm gonna show my husband's friend's mom in the movie.
In a way, it feels like a crazy, actor and producer Olga Temone laughs.
He's been married to Apulanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now Olga for the first time plays under Tuuka's guidance.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanta You made a beautiful movie of us is a rumbal Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka emppa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (who pretends to be Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true example in Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two of them have approached a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little color.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apula would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a depression, and it was really tough.
It was a little bit of a probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some inspiration, and she was right.
Olga tells me that he had heard a lot from Tuuka about this youth even before the film plans.
However, there have been some differences between the parents ’ stories.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Heinola's evil-minded Scribe, known as Tuuka.
Olga was a girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At most, he could have been a secret crush.
According to Olga, he has worked so hard with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a major joint project will not be afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production group will be going to Heinola for a month.
Although the couple living in Et often intend to drive home for the night because of their small children, the distance is not too long.
We will take over the whole month of Heinola.
They have received us with great warmness, only to ask which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to the most expensive play picture in Finland
The budget of the Iron Sky, led by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The shoots start in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins to describe the Iron Sky 2 film in October in Belgium.
The following section of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Comming Race, will be the most expensive play movie ever seen in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Jalmari Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation at work will rise once it has completed the Iron Sky 2, as the film has over €100 million budget.
The films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kakomaa begin in October near Antwerp in AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
There's no fear of a waste budget.
I've been just sick.
I've got such a loose figure on the script, because I know exactly what kind of movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell the newspaper.
Originally, 8 to 10 million had been planned for the film, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget's big, but it's a big stop.
However, 100 million people would get stuck in film because each image angle and performance are so expensive.
Now everything's bent so tight there's no find.
Iron Sky Universe, the film production company today launched a public finance campaign and a bond with a 4-8% annual rate.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and offer during the campaign.
In two years' time, the company will pay back the loan.
The action film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos returning to shirts
The breasts of trends have recently been decorated by big logos.
Some time ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocsja in the Consana.
The promotion of a hooder or a T-shirt mark was seen as some kind of trainee.
But times change.
Sport has become the right fashion megatrend, and so have the old, familiar sports figures, such as Adidas and Nike, have risen to the cooling wave.
And, as ever, the limit of funny and trendy is perplexing: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm of the core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion where the trends were surprised by favoring as boring basic clothes as possible as a means of separating from the mass.
Now, instead of a gray base collegiate, you're going to point the dead end of the cabinet, and you're going to have the manufacturer's logo in front of you.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, for example, Adidas' identifiable track nets, the favorite team's game shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to the street fashion.
Farkki's edge is starting to mock the alps Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
Trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, Versace’s breast of the syphilis makes it clear what brand of clothing is all about.
Would you be willing to introduce logos in your dressing?
The Russian politician published the proof that I didn't hang into the tank's hatch!
It is claimed that a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia's Arms Expo was presented to Russian military industry products in 2015.
In recent days, Russia's media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove large sizes of Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
Even on his own public Facebook page, he published a picture of how he seems to squeal about the hatch of a tank vehicle in very good atmospheres and, at least, not because of their images, it's not about being stuck or angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start by not entering the combat tank, it was the hit-and-run car BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel. I've served in Ural.
I went in there, looked around me, and I came out alone, and Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army's television channel, Zotov, when he was interested in the exhibition, explained Russia's new technology because he was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons. I wanted our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next show, I'm definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the train wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also barked into the stupidity of a writer who wrote it.
One fool wrote it, and everyone else repeated it.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank didn't happen, he said Russkaja Sluzhba to novostei radio.
Zotov's words support the fact that no photographs of the alleged arrest have been published, although during a few days there were a total of 50,000 people in the arms show.
The claim about Zotov's intrusion began with a Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told about his pullout of the tank hatch when he tried and finally threatened to shoot all those around him unless he got out of his surface.
Later, Bloknot’s website published a further story in which the exhibitors reported their views on what had happened.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his big size, simply delayed when he came out.
But he certainly didn't sit for five hours, said to Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot, the director of the exhibition.

The winner shot Ville Korhone when the match was only a fair minute left.
16 September 1995 - East Sanomas
You're trying to find a way to stand up.
He's no paper, but you know he's not hard like a stone.
You are equal in many things, such as vitality.
You're wondering how things go.
You have strength and will to make it work.
It is also important to be gentle to yourself and others.
You're smart, but you're not fast enough to understand someone's view of it.
She's slow, and she doesn't even want to be guided by you.
You're on foot with someone, because one thing goes on.
There is not one way to approach it, but at least you know that you have a common goal.
You've taken a measure with someone.
However, you are not racing in the traditional sense, but you want to know what he really is his men or his women.
Your assumption is going to hit the right one.
That's why it's good to be ruffling his chest.
You have a chance today to deal with someone.
Do it, even if your time is on the card.
One is a self - quality person.
You'll understand it at the latest when he opens his mouth.
Elees and expressions also tell us a lot about it before.
Someone's sad about you.
You will not find anything amazing in this situation, but there is a lot of vague atmosphere in the air.
You know where you're headed.
Your experience is right, although someone wants to show you that he's much more aware of things than you are.
The need to highlight isn't the only thing in him.
Your capacity for various tasks has grown over the years.
Someone sees potential in you.
It's a matter of your self-esteem.
You're gonna stay and see if there's anything going on.
You're on the edge of things.

It shows how interesting you are.
There's been a leak in the Kittilän mine by the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called extraction sandy wave into the stream.
According to the company, the measures to correct the leak have begun.
Alta has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water in the foaming process.
Usually, water is re-injected either as process water for use, or administered as authorised through the surface lighting field to the environment.
The rate of bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour.
According to the company, the quality of the bleeding water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the stuff came into the environment.
The bleeding was observed during the verification round on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the barrier structures of the pool has been observed.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
Finland's country report, published today by the IMF, is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pled into structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and for unemployment protection.
According to Pasi Kuoppamaamäe, the main economic operator of Danske Bank agrees with structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a great deal of sympathy for government action, but on the other hand there is a warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include investment in infrastructure, Kuopapamäki says to the House of Economics.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support poor economic growth.
The IMF expects a growth rate of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will reach 0.9% next year.
Danske is predicting today in his new economic forecast that growth will remain on the arrow this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was in the summer of low growth, Kuopämäki says.
Less attention could again be paid to industry's reduced confidence or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, only a few percent of decimals are involved in the differences.
The recovery Nintendo appointed a new leader
In July, Tantsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died from cancer, began her work on Wednesday, Nintendo reported on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii-consol.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assesses Ace Research analyst for Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to involve Nintendo strongly in mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread for traditional gaming consoles.
In Finland alone, more and more minor asylum seekers arrive
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that even hundreds of children who came to the country would disappear annually.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants are lost annually.
Oversight of the Finnish Immigration Service Juha Kannelmaa explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear under the country? - In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made on their own.
They disappeared nine years ago.
In 2014 similar applications were made in 196, and 11 of them disappeared.
It may be from the background of the disappearance that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to return to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, asylum seekers in Finland had a total of 3651 applications, of which 134 applications were closed because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past 123 years, he says.
Is the amount of money growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 requests for minor asylum on our own.
The total statistics on asylum seekers missing this year do not yet exist, but the number of minor applicants is known and is therefore clearly increasing, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have received the appeal?
For example, do they also disappear into the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the enforcement of the return decisions is carried out by the police, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered people.
He has taken action on this matter.
At the EU Home Minister's Conference on Refugees, Orpo reported on the practical measures taken on Monday to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
Timo T.A. Equipment used for television and radio production of Mikkonen by media contractor who lost their ability to work is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells Huuto.net equipment, which was at the time the most advanced professional equipment.
The first report on the online report was about the Iltamakasin web site.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, TV programs are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested ones will be found.
Of course, there is no more equipment in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from their current Myrskylä home.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've started to invent a little bit and see where they're giving up.
This is where I started. Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no longer any use for television or radio equipment.
It is clear from a recent stroke that a man who did a long career no longer returns to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, which was visited by representatives to collect films and other material from Myrsky.
Traffic is threatening to go into the worst since you think it is: Metro and trams can stop all Friday.
The drivers of the metro and the trams decide today whether to extend their efforts in connection with the demonstration of Friday's mind.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for the time of the Friday's demonstration of mind.
In the afternoon, it will decide whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Superintendent Peggy Hirvonen says there's a great threat on the field.
Night-and-day cuts are a bad thing for drivers, so the government plans to cut the tits raise opposition.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that standing up throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and the trams stand by Friday, public transport in the capital is practically completely stopped.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between 6 a.m. and nighttime on Friday.
On Friday, there will be no close-up or long-distance traffic.
The trains that left before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to fixed stations.
According to HSL data, the majority of buses remain in shadow.
The ACP members are out of work Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by superior forces, the HSL informant Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus routes are going on Friday.
Employees organisations organise large-scale demonstrations at the Rautatientor in Helsinki on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used cynical gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tears gas.
The incident occurred at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against humans.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas, and the teacher thought he was a bomber.
In the United States of Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher considered his own time in school as a bomb bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to introduce his electronics output.
However, one of the teachers thought that the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were invited to the scene, and the situation ended with the boy being taken to the juvenile detention cell in the cuffs.
Mohamed has not been found at any time to claim that he had made a watch.
Still, it's still possible the boy was accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the cops said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The watch is held in police custody, but it was known to be made up of a circuit board and a digital screen between which were wires.
Last Monday, the incident happened and Mohamedia was punished for three days by being forced to leave school.
His father is furious about the case, and the American Council in the country wonders whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
The president of Labour refused to sing a national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the Monarch.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has hurt the people, thought Kate Green was a lab citizen in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s memorial event respected the battle of British Air Force pilots against Germany’s Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corby) stood silently during the national song, highlighted in the opinion.
Corbyn's choice as party leader has divided the lines of the labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral armaments, stop saving and increase in public expenditure.
Today, for the first time, Corbyn is to be present in Parliament in the capacity of the party leader during Question Time by the Prime Minister.
Corby has asked the general public for proposals on what should be asked by Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron crawled on Twitter on the weekend, choosing Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister referred to in his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father was waiting for the trial.
South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating for a week the family death of Minnesota Greenwood.
The family of five were found dead in their home on September 10th and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
First, after shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the house garage.
Dead days already.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this report, the police went to the house for inspection visits and found a huge house all over Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and Successful Enterprise
South Lake Mintonka's police chief Michael Sitair's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses at AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in the StarTribune interview Short reported there are four million different visitors per week.
I have received 50 bids from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a business, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the purchase by Short's family from Greenwood in 2011 of a silly house of $2 million.
The house is advertised on the property website in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars with sufficient garages.
Case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the family father was waiting for a court case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering a variety of precision courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments had been removed from Short's site that were delicious, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered me some cake coffees.
In addition, the owner-in-law was awarded the Hungarian Hippus's month horse owner prize.
This is great, Lois commented on her very good windy plan of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on September 1st and earned 100 000 euros.
The art legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the big race.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, Success Horse Coach Korpi receives the full work peace while working with a horse.
He's got to figure out what to take the horse to compete with.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Lois.
It's a great gesture from the NBL star - the greatest athlete ever made.
The superstar P. K. Subban, Montreal Canadiens, has donated $10 million (approximately 6.7 million) to Montreal children's hospital.
According to the hospital report, this is the single donation made by all time's greatest athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in another financial collection for the next seven years.
Subban and the Canadiens made a deal worth eight years and 72 million dollars a year ago.
So the Subban contribution amount is significantly higher than his $9 million years.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will be given his name in the hospital.
The Canadiens players have been a major help to the local hospitals before.
A year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a sum of money for another large hospital that gave the hospital the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
A Japanese coffee shop can order a wife for dinner - serving just bikinis and snacks on her head
The theme cafes are a tough thing to do in Japan.
The market already has a goat coffee shop, a chicken coffee, a vampire coffee shop, a hug coffee shop and now a wife coffee shop.
It hits lonely, socialized, hungry.
It's the Metro news.
In Tokyo, Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee can be ordered for the evening of a wife or husband.
It's a waiter pretending to be a client's spouse.
\"Police is selected from the list before the coffee shop comes and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is facing just the roses and the bikinis on her head, and the husband is back on tight bikes.
The website offers candidates for wives all information about length and weight to the kind of pillow they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks on the security of cars began to be equipped with
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the sector, reports Intel's release.
The Board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
The ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research findings.
Gartner estimates that about 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles can consume, create and share online data.
We can, and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Mr. Intel Security Director Chris Young.
The ASRB allows Intel to establish best practices on safety and to support the view that cyber safety is an important component of the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.

Chisu went back to the stage... rapping in a brave haalarist.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's an open neck hole in the electric pants.
The outfit presents a beautiful song star's lair belt.
The total is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, a singer who became a mother has been given weights of weight to be cut off with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to fill up a year.
The singer published his first single album in August.
Back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've been sorry to do anything about music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish her new album in a couple of weeks, while her fourth album is called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's motherly style will be an agitated again - now we're seeing breasts.
A true-a-a-a-a-a-a beautiful Kim Kardashian gives speeches to one another.
He presents his pregnancy coat and breasts freely in sexy clothes, last night at one American time, when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left the fish of the husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the chests.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the light of the lightning lights.
The last time Kardashian dressed up for the atrocious maternity stage when he visited his friend at dinner parties in New York just a couple of days ago.
The department stressed the black over-polven boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the performance schedule was pregnant.
Hard laws in the world: No homes, you are lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model of Manon Leloup wanted to take a shortcut to the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary Spearing Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about clean model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins with nothing.
Even if during the previous period you would have been in the costumes of top designers, the new season will begin again in Castinnge.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces to compete with the coconies.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuing to travel and can go for a year so that there is a hotel room or an apartment in which the fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother is unable to travel with you, loneliness can be irresistibly difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they're the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
Agent New York may ask for a drop in pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Designs and designers work together all the time and work as a support network.
When they run out of fashions, it's a little weird.
Models want this sector because of the possibilities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks the job is just a presentation of clothes.
The models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes you feel like they're actors with some kind of role.
But you can also express yourself at the work of the model.
You were modeling for Tory Burch last night.
New York is currently having fashion weeks where designers will reveal their model next year.
Roope Salmine, who has moved into style, plays the most famous Apulanta music in the film
The Roope Salminen performs the band’s founding member Antti Lautala in an early-year film based on the Apulant Society.
Apulanna was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but separated from the association in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie, I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before the descriptions because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I'm only learning her playing style from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a person.
A man with a complete trust in the Roope Salminen and the Dogs doesn't play a role.
The punk-mans are coming with him by nature.
The stars, in the punk season of the star show, surely many saw the first taste, as well as if you've ever been to our gigs.
We've never had anything small, but we're always going full.
In the basso of 1993-2004, you were directed by Tuukka Temosen, the main actors of the film were released today.
The nuclear force known to the audience of the band is presented by young actors who are not yet known to the general public.
Rumbali Sipe Santapukki is represented by Tepo Manner, singer of Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosto Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen tipped off his future nest last night, when he mysteriously told him that he was preparing for the most important day of his career in Snapchat.
Roope has already released a picture of his new collection yesterday in Instagram, which he has been forced to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in mustaches and leukaparra, has shaved his face into siloposch and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychology advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think over recent days about how to tell children about the situation of refugees who are trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
You don't have to talk about it, SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting younger children, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children do not always understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and trouble, he says.
However, if the child has encountered or heard refugees from the television news scene, it is worth speaking about.
It is good to have a discussion from the point of view of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child’s fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that the parents think he's afraid of.
You don't have to be afraid of being scared, even if you're upset and scared.
A younger child is closely followed by the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Larger children are likely to have a discussion about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It's good for parents to have a conversation with them if it's a matter of thinking about a child.
The fact is, not everyone in the world is okay.
Parents, together with their children, can ask themselves, ‘ How does our family view this? ’
In the end, though, do we think that the world is safe or safe?
Parents may also have different educational angles - some may want to protect their children if possible from anxiety.
On the other hand, if the family also speaks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life ahead.
This could be good for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: - Teach your child to help you weaker -
Your own strengths at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Hard to control the bloodline impacting Pallosalamaa
Perttu Pohjola got rubbed up by Apila Pallosalama in the middle of the fall.
It only ravaged winnings and second-liners until, at the end of July, a collapse occurred in the ruins of Tampere.
Since the Ori was thoroughly clogged, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from his veterinarian.
The explanation for passing out was clear.
The horse had a sore throat.
The disease was not from the most mildest head, but it required two medical courses to recover it.
Since Apila Pallosalama had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says she was welcome to the surprise of the horse’s last run.
It was in Turku at its record time after the second SE-mama Taruntuule.
Apila's Pallosalama was on a break when it could have been driven normally for just a few weeks.
Those things, considering a small tendency at the end, were understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a fair race made the Ori a steel.
The horse certainly went ahead of it, and I hope it would have been even.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
When you're not interested in it, it could've thrown you into a lot of fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been removed by such lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
In a nut speed, competitions can't handle Pallosalama, where even warm-blooded rides can't get off.
There's a mirror running in Vermo in the wishes of the North.
However, there is a difference between how Apila Pallosalama agrees.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and it might even fall under the boom of the departure car and something like that.
I hope the Ori are more calm than Turku's leaving.
Apila's Pallosalama can come out of the ring when she's fine, and we're going to take her out of victory, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of your iPhone software.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least a part of the programmes that will come with Apple's iPhone phones may be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from your iPhone, reports the company's CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed during an interview.
There are a number of programs on Apple's iPhone that are relatively rarely used: FaceTime calls, Lehti Kioski, Health, Stock Exchanges, Podcast and Vinkis come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became an obsessive update for iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So Cook says Apple's looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, and Eurostat reported today by the EU Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices led down to lower energy prices.
In this way, Eurostat revised the 0.2% margin for a few weeks.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called basic inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the whole 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
The largest increase in consumer prices in the euro area was 1.4 per cent in August, Malta.
In Cyprus inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent below the EU's harmonised index.
The inflation rate in the euro area remains firmly away from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two per cent marked increase in prices over the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
In the next year, the rate will rise to 1.1 per cent; the central bank expects it to publish its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
U.S. Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The United States' next recession will begin at its fastest below one year, but it will certainly be within three years after the national central bank Fed begins again for a long time to raise its interest rates.
And the fall in the financial markets will begin before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that the interest rates might start already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed at its fastest by next autumn and as a course for financial markets before that.
Or at least this is the case if the world's largest economy and financial markets work like they've done, and if they react to Fed's money flow as they've done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank in its extensive long-term investigation of market and economic cycles of the London market study by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The bank distributed over 60 pages Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe they know when exactly Fed will begin to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they present economic statistics with cool facts and calculations of how the economy and the market have previously behaved at the time and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at the key economic and financial market variables that are now in the same or the second model as at the time of previous interest rates.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a shady state for an increase in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
Not even a year at the beginning of the recovery.
Fed's monetary policy and its respective vigors have been suggesting that the time has started to rise interest rates.
The first interest rate over nine years can already come this week.
The matter will be settled in the middle of the week and on Thursday, when the board of the Fed board of the open market committee is meeting to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed fundamentals rate in June 2006.
At the end of the same period of two years, the series of smaller interest rates of 0.25 per cent that Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25 per cent to 5.25%.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing funding in the United States, and the financial crisis later became a global nightmare of the day of judgment.
The major recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economic imbalances began to slow down than has typically happened since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have been screening the rises and declines of the world's largest economies and financial market movements since 1950 and places from the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed's interest rates and their financial and financial impact have been clear since the 1950s.
From the start of the recovery, the earliest interest rate is less than a year, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase on the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed has in turn raised and turned down its steering rate since the beginning of the 1950s by a dozen distinct cycles.
Each time there has been some differences between others, and the number of times is relatively limited in the review, so it is unlikely to conclude anything certain about the impact of the following interest rates.
In fact, the strategies remind me that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The cause of the financial crisis may not, even through decades of research, be undisputed for the guilty.
But three things about the leaders of the crisis and the reasons that have increased its destructive power must be somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the euro area ECB and the other world’s largest central banks considered their governance rates too low in the 21st century.
They were in position for technocupla's tracks, and they raised the next one at the same time.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated and already too high in various parts of the financial and real economy increased even more than the impact of monetary policy on central banks.
It was born the biggest debt ratio of economic history in the past.
3) In particular, the craziest debt financing packaged into the financial economy, which was the most important feature of financial market history in the past, was the largest exchange rate of shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Even so, it is difficult to question the fact that, in the event of an ever more complex debt gap, the financial markets that have risen to heights were in a rare, dangerous and unstable state when Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
After the interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up, the valuation curves were not as long as the debt ratios had been up.
Risks were realised as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not consider what is going to happen, but give rise to a cause of nuclear activity by mentioning, for example, the following points:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been mad as ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt stock of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, the debt burden has been heavyer than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has flown from the lower and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has slowed down the main types of securities and assets to the top or ever since the financial crisis.
Neither are the strategies of the Latin atmosphere only with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the worst recession to the model of what has happened before.
The euro area's economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in unusually weak condition, but the pressure and risks of the financial markets are significantly higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next comes to tightening up his cash flow.
Perhaps the picture of Albert Edwards' future of the Socie Generale strategy is not as strange as it may suddenly be.
He has been training the bank's international investor clients for the following full translations:
First, Fed's raising interest rates, then the financial gaps break out, and soon Fedin's time to shut down the financial shocks with even bigger QE money injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) preparing computers and printers intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at the HP company service side, the company reports.
In November, HP is divided into HP Inc., a company that focuses on commercial sales, on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and on consumer pc machines and printers.
In 2011, HP had 350000 employees.
Last October, the staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for a one-off cost of the arrangements of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30,000 workers.
The consumer’s reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries, with 60% of its employees in countries with low costs in 2018.
The company tells us that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In that year, 65 per cent of the operating profit was generated by its three major customers.

Yle: Minister Berner has acted under the government of the tax haven.
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (centre) has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paraparatist Company.
According to Ylen, the company was involved in the so-called tax planning.
This is about the Luxemburg-based Saltri II LuxCo, which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still an official member of the Board.
Berner himself says that he has left the resignation declaration in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to leave the notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, says Berner in Yle's interview.
Membership after fusion
The municipality of the Swedish Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg Company.
Kährs is a floor maker, fused with Finnish flooring manufacturer Karelia-Upflor in 2012.
Berner worked with the Government of Karelia-Upflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger at Kährs and in Luxembourg.
According to Ylen, Kährs' ownership passes through a multi-ported ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted government membership in the Luxemburg company Kährs at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been with the government of the Karelian Upflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was picked up with a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my role was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish corporate capitals is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was safeguarded here, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of tax havens is due to the fact that Triton had the largest owner of Kährs' capital fund already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre operated by the company
Espoo Otaniemi will open the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from the evening onwards.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the former Rescue University real estate.
Luona Oy operates in the field of health care and medical care.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTIS prepares an alternative labour market tightening package
The STKC will start preparing an alternative package of government working tensions.
The organisation also hopes that other organisations of the employee’s centre will be included.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently being paid to Friday’s demonstration of mind.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola noted at the organization’s administrative meeting for journalists.
On the other hand, it is estimated that the Central Economic Union (EC) does not have the capacity to hold discussions.
The STTK Economists have calculated that the change in the government competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a terrible enthusiasm on the part of this party to have a conversation if there's one side of the relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as then the government is to submit a communication on its own package to the Parliament and to start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the discussion with the government exists, and it has been constructive about him all along.
In particular, Sunday surgery is a painful place according to Palola.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation in which it will implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STK, Palola does not allow the alternative package to be prepared with SDP.
The employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the working blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the first day of sickness pay is cut, overtime benefits are half paid, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STKK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to protest, and that there has been no organisation of strike.
Thank you to the plan, Mr Fjäder
The President of the Plan, Mr Sture Fjäder, congratulates the STKK on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STKK is now on the same lines as the Plan, since the Plan has already outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without Sjäder the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The plan president, Mr Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will be prepared as an option for surgery.
In the past, Ms Palolan STKK said that he would prepare new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it had long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate with the government of the country's aim of achieving a 5 % competitive advantage as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government submissions.
We are ready to see the terms of the service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the plan lines, as the STKK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The proposed Bureau shall meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. with a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
The same boat, the joint coal, the thugs... play bingo when Sipilä talks tonight.
Green Left of Tampere University
The Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
In the past, Prime Ministers have spoken exceptionally during Mäntsälä's rebellion and war.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Ylen Channel on Wednesday night at 21.05.
The corresponding Prime Minister’s previous speech must go until 1932, when the Prime Minister was the prime minister of the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and Ministers held several radio calls during the winter and the follow-up war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koiviston, but it was more of a ceremony.
In autumn 1976, President Urho Kekkonen quit with a television call from the train performers' strike.
Lone phone, monoarchistic makeup.
The Sipilä's speech has raised all day's criticism and guesses about what I'm about to do.
On Twitter, President of the Left, Paavo Arhinmäki said that \"Silpä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration from the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be debated as well.\"
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, we've already seen a private call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the Ekki Judges of the SDP condemned that the “monarchist makeup: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it”
Ms Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged the Sipila dialogue: \"A half a year after the elections.
Not a single act from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's office, Sipila's speech is recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the SAK President Lauri Lyly and the EC CEO Jyri Häkämämaja, will comment on this in direct communication.
Ylea has been criticised for presenting Sipilä's speech.
We thought about this and said that it was a public service mission to promote public access throughout Finland, the Ylen publication leader in the news of Ismo Silva Yle.
It's like the time of the Tammels.
The speech has also raised loose conduct.
The dinner we've had tonight will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be put on their stockings and put on their best.
My mom puts on a nicest hole, and my dad's making a tie in her neck.
At 9 a.m., it's gonna be quiet on TV, like before I remembered the time of the Tammells, writing a bloggari Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell us why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens of millions of people hiding capitalists who are making a mercy laws for their fellow tax fighters and, at the same time, claiming to the people that we have to cut it when the government is out of money, asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere Green Left Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by the next bingo.
Tonight, do we hear of the same boat, of common coal, of living in debt and of team spirit?
Coupons and pens completed, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: the Western countries rejected Russia's proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abandon power, tells President Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian United Nations Ambassador proposed a plan that would, after a while, give al-Assad the power a little bit of style.
However, Western countries did not respond to the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk, in a bilateral debate, listed three points of plan: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out in a controlled manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, Ahtisaari will remind me of Guardian's interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he had delivered a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the paper, but Ahtisaari says that there are no two words for it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that at that time the Al-Assad troops had already committed a number of mass killings and the key opposition groups refused all the agreements with which they would have stayed in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Middle East, expressed doubts about the speech of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was not ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad at any time.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
At some point, Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have answered that I wanted to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's rock to keep power with some al-Assad supporter.
The escape current of our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own deeds.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we pay for the bill we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Centre for the Management of Asylum Seekers at Storm Tower
The Management Centre for asylum seekers, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in the Tower.
The centre would be set up in the building of the empty Tornio joint-lyse building in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a status solution to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hööppinen (left), Vice-President of the City Council of Tower, that is not the case.
When the whole council was not assembled and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite a council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday to specify to the STT.
At the local discussion, 36 of 43 had been authorised.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 authorised persons.
Based on that, you could expect the decision to be positive, Héppelinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and it was quickly responded.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too,\" Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to tightening up from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) half of the holiday money in the public sector would only account for part of the government’s efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government is pleased to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree to it.
In Parliament, Sipilä told journalists that he had not been involved with the social partners.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were looking for compensation for the government's announcement of working tensions.
If such an agreement is created, we will be happy to accept it as part of the whole package.
In Sipilä’s view, half of the holiday money would be a means of working because it would be directed at almost all employees, unlike, for example, the Sunday surgery envisaged by the government.
The social partners could agree on cutting off holiday money because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present this vision to the Parliament next week on the Wednesday of the crisis in the form of a Government communication on working life.
According to Sipilä, the proposals made by the organisations should be known before.
This isn't the end limit either.
The legislative work will then start to run, i.e. the train will move and it will become more difficult all the time.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long for things like this if there's will, Sipillä.
The list published last week by the Government includes, among other things, the conversion of the end-end and helatorsta into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the first days of illness are cut, overtime paid, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of the work carried out by the employee centre, the employees’ organisations organise a large-scale demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political laws.
Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the juice hall warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi approved unanimously but slightly the expansion of the cornered Norwegian Koivu Oy’s hall, i.e. the storage of juice hall.
The assessment was based on the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than it was originally mentioned.
Also, a busy schedule badly.
It was also a little surprised that the need for order was not known a year ago when the decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400 to 450 square metres was approved in the investment programme, but the most recent partial annual report is to be concluded.
On the agenda there was still mention of EUR 150 000-200 000 investment, but at the meeting Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it would bring work and tax revenues to the local government.
There is no risk for the municipality as the company pays the investment in rent, Vesa Väkiset (ps.) justified.
Another place for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government reduced its previous sharp position to bring street signs in cattleland to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and, in the right sense, the preservation of the livestock tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the cattle language, because there are no historical grounds for it, nor is the language of the herd an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in Joensuu’s region has been more part of the eastern acidic fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no street signs of cattle in the city centre.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the language of the cattle plant, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Even though Joensuu is officially a single-lingual municipality, it is also worth taking a thorough approach to the language of the herd now that multilingualism is living and is undergoing a major change in northern Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well used to benefit from a wide range of regional marketing.
Disposals of train connections are cutting off the vitality of the country
Circumcisions of train connections hit the country's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the business and competitiveness of the county.
And it affects whether or not we can live and work here at all, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points out air transport, which has also been on several occasions in the report.
For the whole country, it is important that we do not succeed in reducing our chances by government measures, as is now the case.
We should look at the impact of these decommissions on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport connections is an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course the better services here, such as transport connections and housing, are easier to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, head of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Marko Junkariinen, Chief of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the connections are weak in the opposite direction.
About half of students from the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, around 10-20 per cent is from the New Land, partly explained by direct rail connections.
Joensuu became one of my sororities for Siu's war
The view of the City Government in Joensuu on the regional Siu war project is apparently unanimous, but there is one sorority among them.
The City Government member Pentti Kessalo (see picture) presented the Government at its Monday meeting for the entire project to be abandoned, but his performance fell unprofitable.
The Government approved the decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give the final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Traffic in passenger trains from Kouvola to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one train path will be less frequent.
There will be changes to passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train couple stays out, but still five times a day from Kouvola goes from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reduction is due to state savings.
For the next four-year period, the purchase of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped off.
The rescue facility released a 12-year-old from the game to the roof, who couldn't get off the roof with my own help.
The situation was brought about at Tornion Hill on Ketotie at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no ladders on the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb along the mass of radio amateurs next to it on the roof of the house.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the other men were moving from the scene and the passersby were alerting the rescue facility to help them safely return to the surface of the last roof.
FedEx's net sales fluctuate, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weakest result in the last quarter. The transport industry lost its annual profit forecast because of the decrease in freight demand and the increased costs of land transport.
The company intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
The company’s share fell by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the actual trading opened on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40-10.90 for the period ending in May. The forecast is down to 20 cents compared to the forecast in May.
According to FactSet's research, the analysts predicted $10.84.
Despite the increase in prices of 4,9 % on average, the forecast has been reduced. These increases take effect on 4 January. Additional charges for land transport by weight or large-scale consignments will enter into force in November.
The company is still waiting for an increase in output from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased turnover and increased online trade.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company has been carrying out very well in a weaker economic situation than expected, which has tried particularly in terms of production and global trade.
The plans for seasonal workers were announced on the day following the announcement by the competitor UPS of their plans to employ mainly seasonal workers similar to those of the previous year, i.e. from 90,000 to 95,000 persons.
In the quarter ended on 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
So the result per share was $2.42.
Net sales rose by five per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be EUR 12.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has been experimenting with the decline in international first-class broadcasts, which has led the company’s Express function to decline.
The strong growth in the online trade has confirmed the result of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport turnover grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed increased costs for large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading had opened the FedEx share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $15.15.
On Tuesday, the share dropped by 11 per cent from the annual average and by 17 per cent from the highest notation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the Central Bank of the United States, Fed, will meet for the most expected meeting in years.
On the wall of the central bank's decorative double-storey meeting room, a wall painting of the United States is displayed.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank Janet L. Yelleni and his colleagues must put the State's financial interest above all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
However, since the Great Land, the central bank’s leadership has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be missing from the point of view of the decision of the cumbersome. On Thursday, the central bank is expected to announce whether the US economy is ready to start a vibration of unpredictable irritation, which has been provided by short interest rates which have remained close to zero at the end of 2008.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, recent attacks on the financial markets can already be completed by cautious central bank officials in divulging the volatility increase by raising the reference rate of federal taxes – even by a quarter of a percentage point.
“The labour market and inflation are naturally the first and most important in their practical follow-up, ” says Lindsey M. Piegza, the banker’s main economist, Stifel Nicolalaus & Co.
However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market will provide sufficient cause for further waiting, Piegza will continue.
Those who have considered it do not agree with what the central bank is going to do, which already causes nervousness in itself.
About half of the economists in Bloomberg's study were exhausted by the increase in interest rates this week.
However, on the financial markets the ECB is expected to expect, and according to the key indicator there is only 30% chance of rising.
If the central bank increases its interest rate, the share rates may be calculated unless the decision-makers soften the impact by promising another increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index dropped 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
\"There were expectations that the central bank would keep the interest rate stable this week,\" said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's chief economist John Lonski.
It would be a surprise if the central bank would raise interest at this stage, he said.
If this were the case, the central bank should think carefully about how to keep the hands of financial operators without shaking their hands.
On the other hand, the experts noted that by raising interest rates, financial markets could be calmed down and uncertainty removed as to when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to tilt to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening up the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the United States' recovery.
Yelle has stated along spring and early summer that she has expected interest rates to be increased this year – despite the need for economic progress according to the Liberals.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is now at its lowest level for seven years and close to the level that the central bank will calculate for full employment.
Wage income seems to be shrinking.
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual objectives of 2 % of the central bank, the decision-makers of the central bank stated that this was a key reason for the temporary impact of oil prices.
“The economy can be maintained even with higher interest rates and needs them, as long as they take into account the strict labour market situation, ” said Ian Shepherdson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , the world-wide financial markets did not fail last month , when China depreciated its currency .
Dow Jones industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from May record height and investors feared that the Chinese economic downturn would also affect global growth.
The markets have been pampered this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by nearly 10% from the top of the May readings.
The market shock means that the decision-makers of the central bank will be more complicated to reflect on the increase in the interest rate.
“The Bank’s work is complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and what news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy has taken place over the past few weeks, the UCLA Zima Center for Real Estate Senior Researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner stated.
He now believes that the central bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
“There is great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy, and there is little reliable information about the recent developments in the Chinese economy, ” Oliner said.
The recovery of the global economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making process of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most powerful player in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, just a hint from the then President-in-Office, Ben S. Bernanken, that the central bank could narrow down the scope of its activities caused upheavals around the world.
In the present world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring world developments, the central bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts so as to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
“The process of decision-making by the Czech Republic is more art than science, ” said Zachary Karabell, the director responsible for the global strategy of Envestnet Inc.
In this month, President Jeffrey Lacker of the Regional Central Bank of Richmond stated that the central bank has previously overreacted with movements of financial markets that do not seem to have a link with the fundamental economic pillars.
Member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee) has called for an increase in the interest rate, as an example of decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
“The economic crisis in Asia led to the decision of the central bank at three meetings to lower the governance rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though only a limited number of identifiable sanctions for the economic growth of the United States were available, Lacker reported.
A year later, the central bank repealed the decision.
\"The Czech Republic should put financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the collapse of the 2008 economy,\" said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest blow doesn't even approach the situation at that time, he said.
\"There is no reason to be afraid of the rise in the coup because of the shock in the market,\" added Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
\"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability.

The Rio Grande Children’s Association in Brazil promotes a healthy diet for lactating people
The Rio Grande Children’s Association SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach the women who are breast-feeding a proper diet. They are presented with photos of babies being breast-fed with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, thus giving the baby all the food they need and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilocalor.
According to the new study, in addition to increasing calories, other changes should be made to diet.
The recent study by Professor Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, Robert Waterland, revealed that the healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Even though Nine is trying to catch the lead at the Today Show, the biggest audience in Seven Sunrise.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would like to thank Canberra for the morning programme for the post-promotion of the Liberal Party election, which, however, did not greatly improve Today's viewers.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital, after Malcolm Turnbulli left Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage's competing channel program were sent from London. Special items of the programme are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
In the meantime, there was no apparent significance for Australian television viewers, since on average, Sunrise had 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, while Today was 339 000 viewers.
Today’s audience figures rose slightly to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but remained from last Thursday’s readings (343 000).
Today's been stuck in Sunrise for the last few months.
Today, on average, there were 318,000 viewers on Sunday, 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50 000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached, on average, 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
Change in the winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

According to the final triangle, Sam Wood really is the bachelor of dreams – but whose man chooses?
Was the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Flows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have deliberately exposed the choice of the bachelor of dreams.
The final choice of son-in-law Sam Wood has been a secret that has been carefully guarded.
The three remaining women don't sweat a word about who's got the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before they put one out of three, and they could have deliberately suggested who the winner was.
Sam Wood's lips are strictly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women were upset that Wood was the perfect man, and the women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood if the last rose did not hit its own place, their answer might indicate who would take the boy's heart.
Jeavons-Flows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been easy since the beginning.
As soon as I got into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit together well.
\"Sarah has his feet on the ground, and he's having a really fun company,\" Markoski added.
\"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she's a good partner and Sam Wood.
Mackay told me he realized last week on a home-town date that Wood could be the one.
When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized this isn't just a race.
When Mackay asked who Wood should choose if he didn't choose her, she answered with dignity:
I can't say, he said.
I like other girls as much as Snezana and Lana are even.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for NFL career start-up
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after this changed to the United States. Also, several other associations were interested in a man after the impressive open day of training last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some trainers would have kept Hayne on the bench, as the man visited the Australian Rugby country team in the lines. Hayne blew off the flight kickback situation in the team on Tuesday, between 20 and 3.
Tomsula, however, showed his trust in Hayne and gave him another chance to return the plane kick. The coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his line in the dresser after the game.
He didn't rob newcomers in front of the rest of the team. He encouraged these.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was encouraged by special forces coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne sets up the capture in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been waiting for the rest of the man's NFL-debyyt.
After the failure, Hayne left the field to rain and later told Hamish and Andy the DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
This happens, and we have to move forward, Hayne said.
Hayne compared a mistake in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his feed was opened to Queensland in his own area.
The whole experience was still incredible for a 27-year-old youngster.
In Instagram, Hayne published a picture of her pose with fans and Australia's flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.
In open terms, President Vladimir Putin’s challenging Hodorkovsky was convicted, the man-owned oil company Jukos was expelled and his work in favour of democracy was limited.
Four dead policemen shot in rubber poles, protesters in Nepal
Four people died in southern Nepal, the source told me on Wednesday, and the police shot a crowd on rubber poles in a demonstration against the alleged new constitution of the country, and there was a four-year-old boy among the victims.
Violences occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, nearly three hundred kilometers from the capital of Katmandus.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, over 1,000 protestors were gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired the air before the rubber bags were fired.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber dusts, which, yes, can kill but who are generally regarded as an alternative to less destruction, suddenly were thus deadly.
This was the most recent collapse in the weeks of continuing protests in Nepal's southern tasangs, where according to the Madhesi tribe, new countries based on the new Constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent terrors since August 10,
when four major political parties signed the agreement on the distribution of the country to the regions, a significant step towards the new Constitution, but the issue is very sensitive in Nepal, where administration has been concentrated for centuries.
The new Constitution has been worked since 2008, but the legislation accelerated the process after thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses of the Katmunds this week, and according to the authorities a new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.

According to the Miami Air Science Department, the centre of low pressure is also located in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antillies. It can also become a tropical cyclone with 60% probability in the next two days.
Google plans to raise 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that he would launch a campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people who have fled to war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of management, Google’s employee Rita Masoud launched the campaign by telling him about his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he fled Kabul with his family.
\"We traveled on a dark train and on a bus, and we were starving, thirsty, cold and scared,\" Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
Many families in similar situations are desperately in need of help as a result of the European refugee and migrant crisis.
Donations are awarded to non-target organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children's Association and the UN Refugee Organization.
Once donations have been collected at Google.com/refugerelief through $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, with a total amount of 11 million.
Since then, the European refugee crisis is the worst in the second world war, and the situation is particularly aggravated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has resulted in more than four million people fleeing their homes this year.
There is also war to be escaped from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from a reduction in obesity for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether you live with mildly overweight type 2 diabetes mellitus after surgery longer than those receiving surgery-free treatment.
\"Death data takes time,\" said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a doctor in a obesity surgery, who dealt with a new study in JAMA Surgery.
With muscle surgery, or bariatric surgery, the stomach is reduced by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of studies have been applied to sickly overweight subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The printing index shall indicate the weight and length of the unit with the normal value of 18,5 to 24,9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is obese and the weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own print index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at the Taiwanese Min-Sheng Hospital used data collected from 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and hive surgery, treatment with type 2 diabetes in mildly fat patients.
After a muscle surgery, the mean body weight index fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body weight index for patients undergoing surgery was maintained at 29 hours.
The total improvement in diabetic patients treated for surgery was 36% and partly 28%.
In the treatment-treated group, only 1% and only about 2% were completely improved.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL-cholesterol were better in the surgical group.
The investigators were also monitoring haemoglobin levels of A1c in patients that reflect the development of blood sugar levels.
Researchers report that the recommended haemoglobin A1c level is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean decrease in haemoglobin A1c from 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, approximately 8% remained unchanged.
However, the study group conducted by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsun noted that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different surgical procedures.
During the fifth year in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher than in the hepato-surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the decrease in body weight index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as well as the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1 % and 2.1 %). Also in the hazard surgery group, the majority of diabetes was improved (46.9 % and 16.7%).
However, according to the Swedish study of the University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgical treatment provides life-long care for fat persons.
In a Swedish study, the probability of death in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery decreased by 29% over 15 years compared to the traditional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone claimed that individuals with a body weight index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
This is the most important finding of the study, as according to which the surgery is safe in the lower body weight index and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease, Blackstone wrote.
Blackstone says that people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27-30.
“We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously, ” the researcher noted.
\"When genetic changes have accumulated in the human body that expose to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to turn the situation around,\"
- Not everyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has stated, and it believes that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the refugee crisis during his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compasion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity should be put ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
\"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,\" said the Dalai Lama in her speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their efforts in a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
At the same time, long-term solutions have to be considered and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education, the Dalai Lama stressed.
Finally, we need to consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The forces have never solved any problems, he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the terrorist attacks on 11 September and claimed that, when resorting to the means of responding to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrollable chain of events.
\"After the 11th of September attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told me that the solution will be made through violence.
I know his purpose was good, but he used to resort to forces with unpredictable consequences, and the Dalai Lama said.
Hand-to-hand swallows quadrupled in children in four years
According to Georgia’s poison centers across the United States, the alcohol level is reported by strong hands in children under 12 years of age in cases of swallowing almost 4-fold higher than in 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia’s poisoning centre, in children under 12 years of age, the incidence of swallowing was increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
\"These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some children are receiving first aid,\" Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink by purpose, some to impress their friends and others as encouraged by social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers who drink disinfectants because of cheap hops.
Teen are told to mix alcohol in the disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of handicrafts.
The kid doesn't think it's bad, \"Lopez said.
The vast majority of attractive hand-desk products are just scattered.
There are hand-made products of mansi, grapevine and orange that appeal to children,
The alcoholic strength by volume of disinfectants shall be between 45 % and 95 %.
A small amount of alcohol may already cause alcohol poisoning in young children.
The medical director, Stephen Thornton, reported Fox 4 in Kansas City.
\"No one would leave whiskey for children, but when hand disinfection products are often left to children, they will quickly obtain a large amount of alcohol. \"
The six-year-old Nhajah Russell recently enjoyed four charms of strawberries gloves at school, and the girl was delivered for first aid.
“A small amount of blood alcohol was 179, which is double that of adult humal, ” says the doctor who treated her from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Chris Ritchey Atlanta.
Nhaijah could not walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors followed her condition over the night in a separate children's hospital for brain damage because she had fallen and had hit her head after having had had had had alcohol, Ritchey told her.
You were really scary, Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants in addition to the fact that your hands should be moved beyond the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died of swallowing hands containing toxic substances that had not been reported.
The health authorities thought that the lethal metanol contained in the product instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been reported as an active substance in the product leaflet.
According to the police report, three fourth grade students in the northern part of New York State were planning to kill an evil teacher in January by setting antibacterial products all over the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to hands and told him not to bring it into the classroom.
The police felt that the failed plan was meaningless and called for the most serious effort at school.
Hello, there's no mismatch in Celtic's lines.
Griffith's trying to decorate the Cellic team, while Deila admits that the team isn't all right, but she believes she's getting the situation right.
Hearts button against SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburto will guard against January's transfer of players so that the team's unity won't be affected.
Aberdeen neck for Celtic five points
The ADM Rooney's first half-time punishment brought Aberdeen scarcely victory over Hamilton at the Pittodrie Stadium. The victory brought Aberdeen to a five-point run for Celtic.
Griffiths makes little talk about incompatibility
Griffiths has ignored the rumors of the inaction in the Celtic lines. According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not the subject of surveillance when preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.
I don't think we're under any pressure, but I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch long for an old Scottish couple – de Boer
The former middle field player in the Rangers and Dutch land team leader Ronald de Boer have found that the Dutch football fans' interest in Celtic has been over, because no more can be followed by Celtic and Rangers' double-breeds.
De Boer, a member of the team at Ajax, said: \"There are no more celtic games in the Netherlands.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved.
It's not just the Rangers' return we're talking about here.
We're talking about Old First.
The Dutch need double-breeds between the teams.
Old Firm's games have a huge tension, and they're also interested outside Scotland's borders.
I'm going to make a move, Deila will convince you.
RENNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian credit confirms that the situation will change.
The lost club fell from the Master's league and lost ten players to Aberdeen, which now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
\"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again,\" Deila said.
- We want to target our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it raises anger or sorrow in many people.
So are we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need Celtic's support because it strengthens players considerably.
It's very important now that we're together.
Warburton careful in January players' transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers boss Mark Warburton referred to January's transfer destinations, he is cautious about the mover race and says that he wants to endanger the team's unity.
- January's turnovers differ significantly from summer transfers, said Brentford's ex-consultant.
The players involved in the team this summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has been successful in our composition this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary players contracts can cause more harm to the team than benefits.
Michu, who is thinking about retirement, is looking for Celtic.
Swansea's attacker, Michu, has been linked to Celtic on the live phone, and Michu, on the other hand, has been suggesting retirement since the Swans Treaty ended.
For years, Michu, a 29-year-old, has been a bully, and he was unable to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA tournament comments by Neilson
Hearts led two to five when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost three to five. The sider's red card was cancelled later.
But Neilson will remain behind what he said. I did not question honesty.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was made up when a man admitted to his singing songs about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at the pub in Edinburgh Roseburn district before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
\"There was a local fight, and the atmosphere was intense,\" said the attacker. \"I can assure you that I will not go back to Tynecastle, except in the lines of Celtic.

McInnes welcomes Hamilton's victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperately forced against Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league. By winning Aberdee, he caught five points in his neck at the top of the Celtic series.
\"There is no cup or league team that would not have won such games,\" said McInnes.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
The number of unemployed in Scotland remained unchanged in May to July. The total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom grew at the same time by 10,000.
According to the UK Statistics Centre (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent when it was 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
The number of people employed in Scotland is 12 000 less than three months earlier, and the number of people employed now is 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased by 74.0% in the quarter, with an average employment rate of 73.5 per cent for the whole UK.
The Swedish Minister for Affairs, David Mundell, commented on the latest figures: \"The long-term management plan has created a basis for a strong economy.
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to preserve as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penalty Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man's best friend and despite my shock, I responded positively.
As the day comes, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell a true story about the death penalty.
The angle of sight would be unique.
Journalists will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and since applications are more than locations, participants will be selected on a makaber value basis.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers from 12 to five.
The following executions are selected moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glosip's closest friends, and I've created a man's personal relationship because we've talked on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can't be here in the capacity of both the witness and the reporter, so I'm not allowed to bring in notes and notes.
All I have to do is press the details into my head.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me of endangering neutrality on Twitter.
This is the basic idea:
When you tell the convicted story in a pleasant way, you get close to him,
I told the reporter that I would differ.
The journalist admitted that he could have been more careful with his words, but still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to tell me what to do, I wouldn't.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be present who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity promotes anti-death penalty movement.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I'm not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Treese, his actions would make him arson after the crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that Mr Glossip has not committed murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't claim to be completely neutral.
You can read an impartial description of the reports of other suppliers.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a watery police station.
The Canning Vale area officer remained dry when he lured him up from the Canning River.
An escape attempt by a Perthian man to get into a low, muddy water, and a few meters away, the police got him back to dry land.
The Canning Vale police received a call on Tuesday from an unauthorised stay in Beckenham.
When they arrived, the police found a suspect trying to punish the police by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
\"The man standing in the water told me he wasn't coming out of the water and told the police to get him in the water, \"the older sergeant Shandell Castledine told me.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not attracted to watering his uniform, so he chose a safer tactics – a negotiation.
Then again, the attempt to escape makes a person resort to amusing means, said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins rejected his car to avoid the police blow and tried to swim across Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the pace inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the operators tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to stop competing with him.
Peter Moody blames the people involved with Racing Victoria for the spy company being deposited last year, and the man threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the officials and the non-immunity department of Racing Victoria have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tatai as a result of recent therapy on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he'd always tried to work for racing. Moody's had a difficult situation when Lidar's sample was found, and he couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue under arrest for a period of six months and a half, and his accusations did not seem like a bitter man.
I've been thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes the frustration breaks down at a one-time rate, Moody said.
They know what really happened.
I have to accept the situation after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm sleeping well.
I want to go upright, and I want the horse owners to think I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I'm no longer a horse coach.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach.
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in the Racing.com interview where he reported about the impeccable spying companies at his stable.
\"A day and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job at my stable with the purpose of spying on my actions.
They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they would be happy to present the evidence, for I have not been caught in any unauthorised.
The former RVL president, Robert Roulston, the current RVL president, David Moodie and RVL's current CEO Bernard Sanundry, were aware of the action then and now.
Should I regard the situation as a personal hunt?
Should the RVL take real action and assume responsibility for the situation in the sector for non-trainers?
Am I a liability to the industry?
Am I really in harm's way?
Perhaps that's what many people think.
Perhaps I should still have a training license and push me away from my duties, no doubt with what I'm saying, I'm going to make a lot of people think that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it's sad.
It's really sad.
I pressure them to make their decisions.
My family will support me, and I can withdraw.
A long-term investigation of Lidar’s cobalts and a recent rejection situation led the coach eventually to become frustrated by the fact that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable master Black Caviar. The man described the day treatment rule as ridiculous after the horse’s feet had been set against the rules.
It's against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it, Moody says.
-A person belonging to my family was wrongly putting clay on a horse's leg.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race.
Moody can be expected to be banned for three months from the treatment of clay against the rules, which has begun to be investigated by the organisers.
This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands the need for rules, but here goes too far, Moody said.
Arrested at Cobram's accident site
Police have arrested a man who ran into a biker this weekend who escaped from a crash site.
A biker was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was injured by serious injuries to hit him on a car in Murray Valley Highway Saturday morning.
According to the police, a man driving a car ran away from the scene and never got to help a injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old from Nathalia reported to the Sheppard Police Department.
The person is likely to be expected to be accused of a failure to fulfil the obligations of stopping and assisting in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old biker from Cobra is still in hospital and has stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the push-ups of opponents
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy considers that criticising his team’s guaranteed game as an objectively targeted action of the NRL two.
According to Coach Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters, the judges gave Storm's nightmares to the satisfaction of the Melbourne hosts to win a card fight in Sydney Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett had a whirlpool of a reference to Storm Broncos' winning charisinfina at the Queensland Cowboys Saturday night. He called the game modeling, and said that there was no more need to care about the button in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his own team's hit-and-run game and said they were just focused on contact when he hit.
Bellamy added that his trust in his team was added by the fact that two top team coaches criticized his team. Bellamy regards this as a proof that the coach is concerned about losing to Storm.
I remember Trent Robinson didn't say anything about the button when his team won us 24th, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee you that we have not changed anything in our defense system or in our technologies all year round. For the last six weeks, we have only invested in a contact game and a fight that has turned us into an uprising.
Trent's been on the job for three years, and he could've been in shock because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football. She reminded her mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
-Wayne's talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday's game to our Friday game and considered their game interesting, Bellamy said.
In 2010, St Georgea received a lot of criticisms about her boring game. Wayne said that the criticism would not hold her down.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, high-speed central shocker.
That's the kind of football they want to play when the player-arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. All teams do not have a central shocker like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence from this when other trainers are so worried about meeting my team that they rely on this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more paintings were made in the Storm and Roosters games than in the Broncos and Cowboys encounter.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was between 20 and 8 in our game there were more situations, but is it interesting to play football?
Or are the footballs and the minors interesting?
I find it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them.
Storm has a free weekend because the team will be allowed to visit either North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharps next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man released 200 000 dollars of bail on a drug case.
The 40 kilos of the drug company that has been smuggled into Queensland has been released from custody of a possible life sentence for 200 000 dollars.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after finding a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo on the Solay ship, which had come through the Vanuatu via South America and arrived at the Coomera port in August.
The police were watching Maximovic and his partner meeting in the boatport for the morning and surprised two of them later in the Coomera Roadhouse cafe. A 40-pound drug deal was found in the Toyota Echo car in the parking lot.
Although Maximovic may be waiting for a lifetime of possession of drugs for commercial purposes, the man's lawyer says that there is no evidence that his client has tried to get the whole lot over, but he may have been in the coffee shop for innocent purposes.
According to Peter Flanagan, the Supreme Court judge, there is a risk that Maximovic is trying to escape the country.
\"Maximovic clearly has contacts with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, the judge stated in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of residence.
The mother and stepfathers of Maximovic paid 200 000 guarantees against which a man was released.
After reading the evidence of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them, Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone is not enough to stop a man from escaping, the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he will surrender his passports both in Australia and in Serbia, will report daily to the police and stay at home from night to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedophiles to send pictures
The paedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get hold of pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone girl while sleeping and logged in to an online communication service where she was able to send a second user unsuited photos of children.
Later, when she woke up, she found her phone disappeared, and she found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When explaining the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five photos were reported to the police, and after examining the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing internet searches that have been used to search for inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg claimed to the police that he tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and that he had presented a police officer with a view to scaring pedophiles.
The prosecutor, Eilith Robertson, at the local court, stated in Dundee Sheriff Court: “Man claimed to be dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted to doing the grave by computer, but claimed that he did so to present the police and thus to be able to scare pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent him the photos and had asked Hogg for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his intention was to mislead pedophiles.
He told me he had disturbing thoughts when he drank and wanted to look at images of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When you found the messages from the phone, the girl shouted at her mother, crying and crying,
The girl saw the inappropriate photos on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
She told me that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked so young.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road confessed to the charges of possession of inappropriate children's images last June 14th. Hogg broke his freedom of bail on 25 January this year and refused to be entitled to a hearing on 24 March this year.
Counselor Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be included in the register of sexual offenders, as it is considered that there was no significant sexual characteristics involved in the violation.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the declaration to October for the background reports of social work.
Hogg was granted an exemption from guarantees in this case, but he was held in detention for other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders even before the date of the judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is holding the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest African Head of State Mugabe fell on the steps leading up to the speaker's height earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spreads through social media.
The opening ups of this House were also shadowed by the claims made by the opposition party legislators that they had received anonymous killing threats to be warned of being barged to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the MPs were buffed and interrupted by the President's speech on the state situation in Parliament, the President held the same speech on Tuesday.
The MDC Party (Movement for Democratic Change) Bishop Innocent Gonese noted that seven opposition politicians had received text messages calling for them not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
\"The last message was sent from an unknown number, but the message title is \"death,\" Gonese told journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message warns recipients that representatives outside the Parliament are no longer covered by immunity.
According to the party's shrink, the party led by Morgan Tsvangira is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings in business services.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and will be distinguished from faster-growing business equipment and services.
According to the HP press, the company will record one-off expenses of USD 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
“Restructures allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise, ” said the CEO, Meg Whitman, who runs the company after the division.
\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company of HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of transactions that help companies move to a new business style\" Whitman said.
As a company, our position is better than ever, and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over USD 50 billion and the company is focused on its mission to provide unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company founded by the University of Stanford, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s, is now divided into two.
The HP has a massive reorganization when traditional desktop computers are switched to mobile devices.
The changes in HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world, and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest in the field of transport, which believes that concentration will bring success.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta: The team must be supported by injured Jack Wilshere before the encounter with Dinamo Zagreb
Wenge has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well, there is no reason why she could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will surely have to miss at least the following four UK national teams.
The biggest trouble with the last problem is that Wilshere decided strongly after the last period and seemed to have returned to his former blade during the new period.
This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career, Wenger said.
She didn't heal well.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't related to his ankles or previous injuries.
Medically, the matter can be like this, but as Wenger also said, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
Here, too, it is also noticeable to be inhospitable.
Premier Injuries Ltd is a list of 23 different kinds of trouble since Wilshere debytoit six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal lines only 65 in total 157 leagues over the last five years.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that, between 2007 and 2008, in six out of eight periods, the team has been the second of the teams that lost money because of the injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible witch background, but Arsenal believes that last year improved injury statistics will continue to develop in the better direction.
\"The ability to return after the injury may be associated with a vulnerable period, when we need to strengthen the body and apply for a competitive election,\" Wenger said.
Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope he can balance his body, and I believe in it, and with it, his career continues as he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Master's league on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team meets Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger prepares for small changes in composition.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely starters.
Wenger can also put a start-up meeting in place of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give it time for the people who need it, Wenge mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F-group's successor, there are the scariest stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated in 41 games time team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night, when the earth sank at a power level of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The shock was a tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenge believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson since the last period, after being forced to bend to Monaco, he is also still motivated by the long-term desire to trust the team towards Europe's championship.
We have a huge energy charge, Wenger said.
- This title has not yet been hit by Arsenal.
On the other hand, we were very close in 2006.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: Comedy Series that taught us truths about male friendship
It is remarkable, especially considering that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and that the suicide statistics for young men are at the highest of 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom and suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) takes the problem by declaring the year 2015 for men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of a challenge.
In a recent study, 2 000 high school students were interviewed, and according to the study, the chances of healing people with depression are better if they have enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of suffering from symptoms was also seen in people with no mental health problems in their vicinity.
But everything is based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content.
With the digitalisation of life, the need for strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
Values, money, image and social status, which are linked to surface success, all of which take attention from our inner values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship, and our mental health is more profoundly affected by internal values.
A billionaire in video games recently said that money really cannot buy happiness.
The fineness of the Frends was that the series turned its main focus.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession but by personality. This was seen in friendship relations.
The series was humoristly presented to Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often need Rachel. It was clear that men could identify with this even though they did not refrain from being fully familiar.
A volunteer worker explained this to me: “When I hear people who are depressed and who think about suicide, it has become clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
People who contact us often can't talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should succeed is strong. A man can easily be regarded as weak if he talks about his problems.
“Frends are one of the series where long-term survival mechanisms are presented.
In the series, small moments of male friendship were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside at a time of despair, but long-term support is provided from a nearby area of friends and families.
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the stage of the series has been raised to live. So if you're participating in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to the coffee at Central Perk.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
Never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after making a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in painting the Masters' leagues and helped the PSG to hit the Swedish team on Malmö's Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on strike when Paris Saint-Germain started his work in the Master's league by hitting Malmö Parc des Princess Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of French champions immediately in the hands of the hand. However, PSG pushed several finish points before finally being able to increase their leadership: Cavani painted after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
In Section A there are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG does not just pursue a secondary position in the drop-off games, but also wants to improve its positions for a quarter-timer in three remaining games.
Even though the SPG got the points, the match was not perfect for Laurent Blanc's team show. Zlatan Ibramovic lost the goalner and the man went on to change when he was against his former home club, where he started his great career in 1999.
“It is not easy to win at home or in guests in the league of the champions, so the 2-0 win and the good odds give a good basis, even though we still had a cheating period, Blanc said.
It's good.
I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two more paintings.
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he got hurt. The team had to be satisfied in the 2 to 5 game Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left Ibramovic in the shadow of four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinian plant that moved from Manchester United to the lines of PSG was named the director of the PSG, who raised the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the title when he praised the ball by Marco Verratt's feed by Malmö's defense and then shot a precise hit on the back corner of Johan Wiland.
However, those expecting PSG’s break-up were disappointed.
The Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched to the field with nine international players from the start. The five men's defense and the two attackers' tactics were difficult to beat.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was scarcely passed by Kevin Trapp's goal in the back of the game in 34 minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into unnecessary feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibramovic, which lost five destinations only in the first half of the day. Immediately at the beginning of the second half, Ibramovic’s kick fed the paint to the potatoes Cavani.
However, Ibramovic showed his nails in the pitch game. Di Maria shot the screw-up by Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was created at the time of Kreiv, thanks to Cavan. By the time he played, the Frenchman who was playing through, he shot a full member when Ibramovic fed him the left wingman for Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's letter ended with another goal, and only Wiland's top defense from a distance away from David Luis to shoot the shot was kept under control, and the target of Ezequiel Lavezz from the change bench was completely abandoned at the end of the mile.
Malmö's bullet Åge Hareide subsequently admitted that the PSG was his own class. \"We played the last league game of the Masters in December of last year.
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
The gloves aren't enough.
A hat for the Parisians.
This was a top-notch fight from them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in share money
The Swiss mining waste Glencore, which was tested by raw materials prices, gathered $2.5 billion in the medium-week stock market as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, a member of the London Stock Exchange, stated in his opinion that he had sold new shares in order to reduce debts by around GBP 1.6 billion.
The company’s market value decreased by 57 per cent this year, with the price deterioration of raw materials, as the Chinese economy’s recession is hampering demand and straining the market.
As a result of the acquisition, Glencore's share price pained the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131,60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69 per cent.
Last week Glencore announced that it was going to collect $2.5 billion in share capital as part of a strategy to reduce its debt of USD 30 billion by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at 125 penny prices, which account for 2.4 per cent of the price of the closure on Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares, up to 9.99 per cent of the total group.
The continuation of the Chinese economic downturn has led to the collapse of iron ore prices, while the decrease in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 and 40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Communication published on Tuesday at the White House confirms that the Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States on a visit to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives at his first official visit to Washington on 25 September. This is a counter-visual visit by President Barack Obama after visiting Beijing last November.
Following bilateral discussions by the Heads of State, the President of the United States and the spouse of the President Michelle Obama will arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan for a visit to the state.
\"The visit of President Xi Jinping gives an opportunity to extend cooperation between the United States and China in the area of global, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the possibility of constructive discussions on the subject of which there are differences,\" the White House Communication says.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February and is expected to stop at Seattle meeting several US technical leaders. From Seattle the President's journey would first continue to Washington and then to New York at the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about the cyber theft claimed by China and the increased country's activities in the conflicted waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon's deviating diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon was very pleased to have a conversation with Effie Brown, African-American, and he said that there was no need for diversification behind the camera.
The actor in the HBO Project Greenlight series presented on Sunday night interrupted Brown when this explained how important it is to take account of the different views of the project's top black character in the script selected.
\"Moninity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program,\" Damon claimed.
Brown stabbed with a shocking and injured claim. But, clearly, she said, \"Oh, it's only after Damon's comment on the film in Mars.\"
Damon and Brown met with other producers of Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
