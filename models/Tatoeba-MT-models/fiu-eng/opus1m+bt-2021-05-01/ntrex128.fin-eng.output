Members of Wales are afraid of being stupid.
Some Members of the Assembly are confused about the proposal that their title should be replaced by MWP, a member of the Wales Parliament (member of the Welsh Parliament).
Kohu started his plan to change the name of the delegation to the Wales Parliament.
The members of the delegation are concerned, regardless of the party, that the change may make them uncomfortable.
According to a Labour Party representative, the group is concerned that the name-crime with the words \"Twp\" and \"Pwp\"
For readers outside Wales: in Wales twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to one representative of the Plaid Group, the majority of the group is not satisfied and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group feels that a change of name is an open mind, but points out that the MWP word is a short word for stupidity.
In this context, the Wales language w is expressed in a similar way to the Yorkshiren U-book.
The Commission, which is currently drafting the legislative amendment necessary for the change of name, said: \"A final decision on the names of the members of the representative shall of course belong to the members themselves,
The Swedish Government Act 2017 empowers the delegation to amend its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals according to which the appointment of a representative body to Wales will benefit from broad support.
The Commission favours Members of the Assembly as a title for the members of the Wales Parliament or a shorter WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion survey.
The members of the representative committee appear to propose alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may give rise to a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to have a legislative proposal for amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, such as rules on the loss of representation and the format of the comitology system.
During the legislative procedure, Members of the Delegation may give their final vote on what heading they should be invited to do so.
The Macedonians will go to the parliament during the referendum on the modification of the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote as to whether the name of the country will be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum aims to resolve the debate for decades with a neighbouring country with Greece, which also has its own called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time repeated that the name of the Nordic neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its efforts to join the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum, has said that he should ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of a referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev rationalise that change of name is simply the price paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martins' watches will be quiet as the churches of Harlem live in difficult times.
\"The elderly people I've been talking to say that before every street corner had a bar or a church,\" says Adams.
-There's neither one...
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said that the human contact has changed.
“The bars no longer have the same living rooms in the neighborhood, to which people regularly gather.
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not go as far as the managers imagine, and sooner or later they have returned to the departure box.
He added that churches can be replaced with houses and apartments that are not the ones that would support the rest of the neighborhood saints.
“More people who buy housing from these buildings will be white, ” he says, “and thus they will be forced to close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most people who are moving to these rooms will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by the white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins for decades later.
The original White Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby congregation of black people acquired the property of the building.
St Martins took over the Black congregation under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the merchants of 125th Street, the central trade street of Harlem, against the hiring or promotion of these opposed black men.
When Father Johnson’s parishes designed reconstruction, the fire that was set on fire in 1939 damaged the building badly, they took on the tower clock.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower bell,
The expert who played the Tower Bell game in July called it the second name: \"Culture Island and Unreplaced Historical Instrument\".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also pointed out that this was the first tower bell game played by the world's black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a bigger tower clock game 18 years ago.
According to Merri Weather, St. Martins didn't replace her.
In the last few months, St. Martins has developed a complex auction involving architects and contractors employed by church laymans, on the one hand, and episcopal skiing on the other.
In July, the governing body composed of the earthly leaders of the congregation wrote to the faucist about the concern of the faucist community trying to attract the costs to the drawer, even though it had not been involved in the hire of architects and contractors sent by the sage.
Some congregationists complained about lack of transparency in the fading.
The shark damaged a 13-year-old hummer in California.
The authorities say that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him as a boy divest his lobster season on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB TV that he and his friends had dived on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy cryin' help.
Hammel told me first that he was only thrilled to catch a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming, \"I was bitten.\"
I was bitten!
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that this whole cell bone had been torn open.
I've heard everyone leave the water: There's a shark in the water - Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady's children's hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
On a media event, Captain Larry Giles said that a few weeks earlier, a shark had been observed in the area, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added the victim's serious injuries to his upper quarter.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablad's Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for scientific and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there were more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's going to the British Kingdom Beauty Hospital.
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in the beauty care departments where expert advice is provided.
This is a significant movement for a class of beauty treatment worth GBP 2.8 billion in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow even though sales of fashion and home supplies are weakened. Larger beauty care departments are being tried in 11 shops across the country and are successfully extended to other shops next year.
It is placed in beauty care products because supermarkets strive to fill the shelf space that was previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's tells of its variety of beauty treatment products having doubled to 3,000 products, which for the first time include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and will receive their own brand-specific sites like Boots stores.
Supermarket is also re-enacting their Boutique makeup. In the future, the majority of products will be veganous because young shoppers increasingly demand it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop Water Chain is testing rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon South London, and the other one will be opened to Shelly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food from nearby shops to small single purchases will force supermarkets to create new incentives for customers.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe has said that the stores will look even more like the supermarkets when the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in their stores, and also the Habitats. The company tells us that it has promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty care and pharmacies.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boots at the beginning of the 21st century, but it ended up arguing about how the outputs of the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy is followed by a commercial transaction where Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical business in Lloyds Pharmacy with a total of 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company told Lloyds that Lloyds was part of a plan where four shops were extended by signs like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have changed the appearance and mood of our beauty services to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in the workers who have received special training, who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand will respond to all our needs and attractive environments, as well as our convenient location will make us a convincing beauty shopper, which challenges the traditional way to make purchases.
Peter Jones - after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million pounds agreement
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his rage when Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-dollar agreement with her lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home supplies and costume marks to Truly.
The two companies are compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old drinker of this Morning program announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was angry with Dragons Den by withdrawing from their productive lifestyle business at the last few moments, and now he's planning to focus on his new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell us that Jones had been in such rages last Tuesday at a tight atmosphere that was held at the business empire headquarters Marlow, Buckinhamshir. The TV Stargirl had admitted that his new $1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their home-food and costumemarks to Truly.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand and has been decomposed to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
In Instagram, 37-year-old Willoughby reported that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: \"Truly was clearly Holly's main project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His departure has left everyone astonished.
No one believed Tuesday events so close to the release.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting for sale.
This Morning is one of the UK's most secure stars, and according to experts, its departure can cause the company millions of losses due to product placements, which include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household supplies, not to mention delays in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and his mate, Dan Baldwin, have been close for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Cappin Trulyy in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples travel together and Jones owns a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is being baked from the new M&S brand transmitter and replaced by Ant McPartlin I'm A Celebrity program.
The source close to Jones said last night, \"We don't comment on his business.\"
And then we fell in love.
He made a joke about the criticism that would be received in the media about his comments, which some considered inappropriate to the President, as well as his positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said I was faking the voice of a news anchor.
I didn't give up at all.
He pointed out Kim's interest to meet again after Trump had a major step towards North Korea's nuclear separation since the first meeting in July.
However, the nuclear negotiations have been fined.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North is not seeing a reaction from the United States.
On the other hand, he stated that the United States will continue its sanctions for maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
- With North Korea, it's going to be great, he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship...
In his opinion, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped with freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when speaking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be Presidential, but instead of trying to get 10 000 more out, we’d have about 200 people standing right there, Trump said, by showing the public directly ahead.
Indonesia’s tsunami and quake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
As an example of the recent announcements of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency state required for international assistance was not declared, although around 10% of the people in Lombok had been homeless.
“In many cases, they have unfortunately made it very clear that they do not ask for international aid, so it is a little challenging, ” said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a group traveling to Fire, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the informant of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation, so as to see whether international organisations are allowed to participate in the aid.
Indonesia remains unprepared to meet the natural forces, taking into account frequent earthquakes.
Although Acehin has built tsunami shields, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
This request was likely lost due to the missing tsunami warning sessions, even though the warning was in effect.
Traveling between the numerous Indonesian islands is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lomboki earthquake is on its way to Fire, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident zone.
President Joko Widodo made it possible to develop the existing infrastructure in Indonesia at the centre of his election campaign and he has given away money to improve the roads and railways.
However, there has been a financial deficit, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Some pressures also increase the tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted the oldest form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street fights with jungle knives, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons, leading to the death of more than 1,000 people, and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.

He moved the ball to the left before he terrorized the shot towards the rear pole.
The launch was cutting high above the penalty zone towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to make myself a game to get players like the ball and Shaq always play as much as possible up, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself, ” said Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approach, I took one touch, and I set off without thinking too much.
Chelsea led the match in half time between 1-0 Belgian Eden Hazard painted in 25 minutes.
The blues fly gave Mateo Kovacic a head start before spinting off near the middle field and smothering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic played a fast wall belt in the middle field.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty zone with a great breakthrough.
Hasard escaped defense and passed Liverpool with the shot of Alison Becker's left foot into the rear corner.

The number of deaths of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832 deaths
Early on Sunday, the Indonesian disaster agency reported an earthquake and tsunami to the number of death victims of 832.
At the press conference, the agency's informant Sutopo Purwo reported that many people had been trapped in the ruins of failed buildings when 7.5 magnified earthquakes struck on Friday and raised waves of up to six metres high.
Fragmented buildings spread widely to 380 000 inhabitants in the city of Please.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death.
The body of a woman who was found in Birkenhead's Merseyside this morning started a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was stabbed at 7.55 Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police are asking people in the area to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in its initials, but I appeal to all those in the vicinity of John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to all taxi drivers who may have recorded something on the dashboard video to contact the police.
A female informant of the police has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, the crime scene has become known to a woman who has asked her where she was found.
As the investigation continues, the police report that they are trying to inform the victim of what happened.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him that no one was allowed inside or out of the building.
He had no word when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they can go for hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was told that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
There was a tearing woman at the scene.
She repeated her repeating that it was terrible.
Two afternoons of isolated territory had two Mays, and outside the third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who controlled the flat.
Anyone who knows anything is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to call anonymous Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 using the recognition 247.30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell Bats also became part of the history re-written jurisprudence
Indeed, evicting the statue would be a poetic right, given that his own fanatical puritans destroyed British cultural and religious monuments as best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as a \"type-to-type\" and \"signature\" history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would be a goal of Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't tell or execute the British civil war icons.
False Cromwell might have to suffer from the actions of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's grand description of Cromwell reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and that is historical evidence of the figure that many still consider to be praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Monet, although perhaps more than in the 19th century than today, considers Cromwell as a defense against the external pressure of the Parliament, which, of course, was caused by the Monarch in this case.
Whether this is an exact description of the subject is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the 18th - century conflict has shaped our nation's later development. Cromwell, on the other hand, has to identify the character that represents the other half of that division.
In addition, as a state minister, his achievement deserves praise and reminisce.
Killer's kid broke out of Chinese farmer's life.
The local media report that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in Southeast China.
Only the body of a man identified as ‘Yaan’ was found near the pig in Liupanshui Square in Guizhou Province. The man’s artery had broken down and he was all over the blood, South China Morning Post newsed on Sunday.
Sicopaim is preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
His news was that he and his cousin traveled from nearby Yuna County on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also saw the door of the nearby pig being open.
In Sikala he said that he saw a great cry, which was in the blood of his mouth.
According to the news, a criminal investigation confirmed the life of a 250-pound bear farmer.
The Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named Wuuu said that my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised,
The surveillance camera image shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed pigs Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed the pig didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the tower leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked up, so that it wouldn't harm other police forces when they collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the principal authorities are told about the compensation for the trial of the death case.
The pigs are known to have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 pounds [300 kg] climbed against this tractor by a farmer in Wales until his wife managed to upset the animal.
The Oregonian farmer had to eat his pigs in 2012. After the event, the farmer living in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that although the pigs are not usually aggressive, the blood taste could act as an trigger.
- They're just playing games.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt you.
All we have to do is respect them properly, he said.
The remains of the Hurrikaan Rosa bring great hardships to the southwest parts of the United States.
The Hurrian Rosa will be weakened as it moves above the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the days to come, however, Rosa will bring floods to Northern Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, which was the first-class hurricane, on Sunday morning from the east coast, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure on the Pacific that is going east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa arrived in California on Monday as a tropical storm, it starts to push deep tropical humidity north towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeter rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form large rainy areas for lunch in the next few days.
Local rain levels of 25 to 100 millimetre cause dangerous rainfalls and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfalls of between 50 and 75 millimetres per hour in certain landing areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas are expected to have lunch, especially Arizona, up to 50-100 mm of rain.
The rainfalls are possible and the conditions can be reduced rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the case of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness on foot.
The rainfalls can turn the canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms can produce local windfalls and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rainfalls to the coasts of South California.
The rainfalls of more than 10 millimetres are possible, causing small waste streams and soluble roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the area.
The fragmented tropical rains begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday until the rain expands on Monday and Tuesday.
The rainfall is spreading to Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts all Wednesday.
In October the United States can be seen with strong swings at temperatures as the Arctic region cools, but even when the tropic stays relatively warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature swings at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, an excellent example of great differences in temperature is seen on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines.
The summer heat again seeks to strengthen and expand in the days to come.
The beginning of October is expected to be largely warm in the middle and east of the United States, at a temperature of +26 degrees from the south plains to the north.
In New York, the temperature can be pained on Tuesday to +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees more warm than average.
According to our long-term forecasts, the United States in the east have good opportunities for higher average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million considered Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million attended a six - channel broadcast on Tuesday, where Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexual crime in the 1980s, gave her fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political situation of the Patti situation continued as the television companies stopped their transmissions at the last minute, according to which the FBI will carry out a weekly investigation of the charges by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, on the basis of an agreement.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100% certain that he had lost his hand in Kavanaugh's hand and tried to remove his clothes in high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional witness, saying that he was 100% certain that this was not the case.
The audience was probably more than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring viewers who are looking at offices.
Something about proportions tells us that the reading corresponds to the number of viewers in the American football dropout game or Oscar gala.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers from all television companies was Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported the name Kavanaugh. On average, there were 5.69 million viewers during the full-day consultation.
The ABC was second on 3,26 million of its viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3,1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 89 million, and CNN had 2,52 million viewers.
After consultation, the interest was still high.
There was Flake at the heart of the drama on Friday.
CNN's and CBS' cameras described how the protesters' screams escorted him on his way to the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs on Friday.
CNN looked straight at the way he stood at a minute's store watching the music fly down.
-Sison right in front of you, a woman said.
- Do you think he'll tell the people the truth?
You've got power, and so many women are powerless, and they told him,
Mr Flake said that his office had issued an opinion and that before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to tell after hearing the committee.
An hour later, the cable and broadcasting networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the entry of Kavanaugh to the vote of the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake said that he was only working in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake convinced herself of her friends, with Democrats Chris Coons, based on the discussions she had conducted.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for Brexit's political arrest
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May blames the people who criticise his EU special plans for politics, which threatens the future of Britain and its national interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party meeting at Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
On the front page of the newspaper next to May's interview, another interview was held where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for the proposal that Britain and the EU should impose import duties on each other.
Shot of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of a LSU player
Police have arrested a person in LSU for shooting at a 20-year-old named Wayde Sims' death.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and the Baton Rouge Police Department says he's charged with a second-rate murder.
The authorities published a video of Sims' and Simpson's midterm investigation, where the police say Sims lost his glasses.
The police found eyeglasses at the scene and told us that they had found Simpson's DNA, reports WAFB.
The police are telling us Simpson admitted to the shooting of Wayy in interrogation.
According to the Advocate magazine, his guarantee was set at $350,000.

The Agency would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Police, and the area residents for assisting in the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, the head of the LSU's movement, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their novelty and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father played basketball, LSU.
He wrote an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 record balls in the match last season.
The LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, said Friday morning that he was, uh, terrified and shocked about Wayden's death.
You always fear something like this, Wayde said.
The volcano spits ashes on Mexico City.
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl Mountain has reached the southern residential areas of the City of Mexico.
On Saturday, Mexico’s disaster prevention centre urged citizens to stay far from the volcano when the crater’s activity was accelerated and, during the day, 183 gas and ash bursts were registered.
The Centre will register the jymina and vibrations several times.
In the social media, images were published in areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City, where car windshields covered a thin layer of ash.
Geophysians have discovered 72 kilometres of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 magnitud in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan parasites are bringing together before the anniversary of the independence vote.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in the assembly of protestors and melkapolis who supported independence. Thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the divorce vote.
The police arrested a group of masked supporters of independence, who threw the police on eggs and ground ground, which formed dark clouds of dust on normal streets filled with tourists.
During the day, more dwindling came out when the police used their pamps to control the nostrils.
The links between the supporters of independence and the groups of Unionists continued for several hours, when they said: \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The local press reports that fourteen people have received treatment for the minor injuries caused by demonstrations.
The excitement is still on the ground in the area of independence after a year of the 1st October referendum declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalan parasites.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although the participation was low in the anti-counterfeiting boycott.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent gatherings when the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations located across the region.
The independent groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a national police demonstration.
However, the demonstration was arranged, but it had to pass another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electric man who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we experienced one of the best moments of our lives,
I saw my parents crying for joy in voting, but now we're stuck, he says.
Despite the close victory that has been achieved in the regional elections last December, the pace of the parties in favour of the independence of Catalonia has been subdued this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or arrested waiting for a trial to organise a referendum and a subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described a police demonstration on his phone, says on both sides of the politicians there is a dispute.
You're gonna get blackmailed all the time, he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine English leaders in detention until last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European elections.
\"Adapting to become a European candidate is the best way to condemn the deterioration of democratic values and the oppression we have seen by the Spanish government,\" he says.

They might have taken a shot at the car somewhere later in the range.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 with Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston guaranteed victory
The serialists from Livingston astonished the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard only the second defeat in 18 matches as a manager of the Ibrox Society.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win over to Gary Holt's team on a split second place with Hibernia.
Gerrard's crew were left without the first foreign victory of the season in Premiership. Next, next Sunday, it will be the serial leader of Hearts, eight points ahead.
The Rangers will still face Rapid in Vienna's European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued its lossless pipe in the series to six matches.
Livingston lost places against a visitor who was suffering from a lack of steel
The Dutch team should have been in charge long before its goal has caused the Rangers some serious trouble in their veins.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide, and next thing you know, Alan Lithgow was able to slide off on the painting to Craig Halket's sweater, but he passed the ball.
Fathers gave the ball management to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
This is exactly how the important goal came.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga to move the ball to the center of the penalty zone and finish.
By then, the Rangers had held the ball, but said the home team had a defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly able to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow passed the ball from another special situation in Livingston.
The rainy concentrations in the Livingston Penal Zone were constantly cleaned out, and two of the situations required an unnecessary penalty - Halket's controlled exchanger Glenn Middleton and the hand hit ball.
- A great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alaskar Lamont Tony Macaroni
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for each player, continuing through the rises.
The team's play mode and crew have hardly changed since it got back to the highest serial level.However, the Hollt must be recognized for the way in which he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Capt. Halket was super cool in leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worral toes all the fight.
Although there were no ideas from the Rangers.
The team has been very well under Gerrard at times, but is now far from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once. This should be a wake-up to the Rangers, which is the middle corner of the series table.
Erdogan received a variety of receptions in Cologne
The smile was sensitive and the sky was blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of which is to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and the EU's efforts in Turkey.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new Laundry.
The largest Turkish population in the city is located outside Turkey.
The police prevented a group of 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the Musketeer, justifying it for reasons of security, but there were still many supporters to look at the President.
Hundreds of protestors who opposed Erdogan - many of whom were Kurdeja - also brought their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The competing demonstrations reflect the distribution of opinions, and some of the German Turkishs greet him as a hero while others are prodigy of him.

The accident took place about 10 local times in Deptford Southwest, near the road to Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is a lively traffic.
The driver stopped and the medical staff came to help the victim, but he died at the scene.
A few months earlier another biker died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a half a mile from the Saturday accident site.
The city police say they're trying to identify a man and inform him of his loved ones.

Long Lart Prison: Six guards were injured in unrest
The officials in prison report the high level of security for injured men in prison unrest.
The spreads began at HMP Long Lart in Worcestershire at around 09:30 p.m. on Sunday, Britain's time and continue.
The Tornado Special Police have been brought here to calm down unrest, with eight prisoners in one prison wing behind.
The police had minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison informant said: “HMP Long Lart prison has been sent to a special trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We're not accepting violence in our prisons, and it's clear that responsible people are being taken over by the police, and they may have to spend longer behind bars.
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lart, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reported to have been treated in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October, the prison was alarmed by riot police because of serious unrest involving attacks on personnel with billiard balls.
The Hurrian Rosa brings the threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
There are rarely tropical low pressures in Arizona, but that is exactly what is happening at the beginning of next week, when the remains of the Hurrikani Rosa move over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rainfalls.
The national weather service has already given warning about the tough days of Monday and Tuesday in the cities of West Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, and Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to proceed directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday in the form of rain.
The national weather service in Phoenix pointed out that only ten tropical storms have preserved a tropical storm or low pressure area 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of about 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National hurricane centre predict the rainfalls of 50-100 mm. With the Mogolin ridge in Arizona, there can be up to 150 millimetres in places.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including central rock mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 millilitres can be certified. A total of up to 100 millimeters may be available at some point.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing to dryness by testing the area if there is no danger of heavy fires.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be beneficial because of the difficult drought suffered in the south.
According to the U.S. Drizzle Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from extreme drought, which is the second highest grade, reports Weather.com.
My hurran Rosa will first make a landing in California's peninsula in Mexico.
Sunday morning Rosa's location is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At the time, the hurricane's strength is still at a wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm will lose its power in the face of cooler waters in the Pacific Sea.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a strong tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In some Mexican rains can be tough and cause a considerable flood risk.
“California’s peninsula is expected to have 75-150 millimetres, and up to 250 millimetres, ” says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday mornings. From there it will continue through Arizona to the south of Utah on Tuesday by late.
“The highest risks associated with the remains of the Rio or its remains are very severe in hundreds of California peninsulas, North-West Sonora and the United States South-Eastern desert, ” reports the National hurricanes Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening rainfalls and waste streams in deserts, as well as earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning in Britain.
He was taken to a hospital where he was reported to be in a very serious state.
The police report that they have arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking to contact anyone who may have a mobile phone record of the events.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced Democratic Party's atrocities and anger...
\"The voice on behalf of the judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the democratic party,\" Trump said at the Wheeling meeting in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from a democratic party's atrocities and anger... all the time in his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual harassment, which would have taken place decades ago during their teen years.
Ford also proved his accusation in the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellentness, nature and courage, that day.
\"The voice in favour of strengthening the name of the judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most respected legal students of our time who have excellent seams for public service,\" he told West Virginia's supporters.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when speaking about the importance of Republican voting activity in foreign elections.
- We're five weeks from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full, he said.
That's why I'm recycling everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats had taken up the role of 'responsibility and prevention'.
The senior assistant to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote on Kavanaugh's appointment was to be expected by the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, expected to rise in the number of deaths
On Saturday, at least 384 dead earthquakes and tsunamis were reported by the authorities on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia.
On Friday hundreds of people were gathered to the city’s beach festival, as the waves of up to six metres [6 m] hit the beach in the night’s distress, and many of them washed up to their death in the face of the waves of destruction.
Tsunam caused 7.5 magnitude earthquakes.
When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach, and they did not immediately escape when they were victims of it, ” says Purwo Nugroho Jakarta, a BNPB informant at the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, ” says Nugroho, “it drew along cars, trees, houses, and struck all over the country. He added that the tsunami reached a speed of 800 km (800 km) before it hit the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing to trees, he says.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The images published by the Disaster Office show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and degraded bridges and a mosaic surrounded by water.
Afterquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes seemed to be in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Office for the Evaluation and Application of Indonesian Technology BPPT issued an opinion that the energy released in the Great earthquake on Friday was about 200 atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima World War II.
It says that the landscape of a long and narrow town at the end of the bay may have sprung tsunamis.
Nugroho described it as a disaster and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls, and hotels were damaged.
He reported the ruins of some victims' bodies, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and that the damage might be larger than 300 kilometers north on a continuous coast, a region known as Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
The communication connections are completely different and there is no information about Donggala,\" says Nugroho.
According to the Red Cross opinion, there are over 300 000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse, he said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not telling me that the tsunami hit Palu. Although the authorities said that the wave had arrived during the warning.
The man on the top floor of the building in a social media video is screaming loud and clear about the warning of tsunamis for people on the street.
Only minutes later, the beach is hit by a water wall that takes buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately verify the trueness of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure, which cut off communication connections around Please, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The authorities tell you that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities with transportation machines, but you still need food and other essentials to be evacuated.
The city airport has only been re-opened for aid operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami's victim count is over 800.
It's really bad.
The staff of the World Vision Donggala have reached a safe place in the city of Please, where they have been housed in the inner yard of the office for the tent Tunnels. On their way they passed the disaster stage, says Doseba.
They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses, he says.
It's really bad.
At the start of the aid teams, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palus.
According to Indonesian provisions, financing, equipment and personnel from abroad can only start to flow once the accident area has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“There is still a regional disaster, ” says Aulia Arrian, editor of the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"When the government says \"OK, this is a national disaster, we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made,\"
When the second night landed, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family members in the lost hope that their loved ones would be different from the dark story of natural disasters on the miracle trade.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the water.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s interdependence team coach, had trained two missing addicts for Asian races earlier this month.
The Roa Roa Hotel was also trapped in her students, says Mandagi.
- As an older member of the peak, I have my own emotional burden, he says.
Gendon tells me that he was desperate to reach those who took part in the beach festival Please competitors in the WhatsApp messages after the news of Roa Roa Roa’s fall spread among the union community.
However, only one gray mark appeared after the messages he sent, instead of two blues.
It means, I understand, that no messages were received, he says.
The thieves took $26,750 to the ATM supplement in connection with the Newport on the Level
The thieves took $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's security company when this was supplementing the ATM in the Newport on the Levite.
The driver of the car had been emptying and supplementing the ATM in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy reports on the release.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, he was behind him running to my husband, who also stole the money for the delivery.
According to the press, there were several people who saw escape from the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
People who have information on their identity are asked to contact the Newport police in 859-292-3680.
Kanye West, Puppet change his name, Ye
Lieutenant Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: \"The figure that used to be known as Kanye West \"
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his future appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yandhi.
He replaced the program by the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the program, withdrew his participation for emotional reasons.
West has previously told him that the word has religious significance for him, not only that it is short of his trade name.
When I discussed the name of the album earlier this year with the radio driver Big Boy, the West said, \"Yes, it's the most common word in the Bible, and it's important there.\"
So I'm you, me, and all of us.
It began with Kanyea, which means the only thing, and ended up in a shorter form of Ye - which merely reflects the goodness, wickedness, confusion, everything in us.
The Album is mainly thinking about who we are.
He's one of several known rappers who've changed their names.
Sean Combs is known for the varied name of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he favored the names of Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former partner in West, has also removed and returned the lines and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO promise not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, performing in the Tlatelolco Plaza office on Saturday, promised that no one would use an army to defeat the people of Mexico.
The armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were entrenched in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student support and by opening more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities would drive young criminals.
The US should double the funding for artificial intelligence research
The United States should double the funding used to investigate artificial intelligence when China enhances its activities, thus saying Google, Microsoft and Apple-working financier Kai-Fu Lee.
The opinion was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence in various parts of the US administration, although the US lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plans last year: it seeks to lead the development of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double budget for a artificial intelligence research would be a good start when we note that other countries are so far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence,” Lee says.
The double financing could double the probability that the next major artificial intelligence would be carried out in the United States, Lee reported this week in the CNBC interview.
Lee's book – Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silkon Valley and the new world order – published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt release. He works as CEO in Sinovation Venture, which has invested one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s he developed an artificial intelligence system at the Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the U.S. High-ranked Othello player. Later, he acted as a director of Microsoft Research and Google’s Chinese activities.
Lee recognised previous technology competitions by the US Administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be organised to identify future visionaries.
Lee says that US researchers have worked hard to get public aid.
It's not China that takes academic influences, it's big companies, it's Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited university excellence in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up their artificial intelligence efforts.
- I think the doctorate in artificial intelligence should be automatically given green cards, he said.
The Chinese Government’s next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to US researchers, but academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together the industrial and academic partners in the world, and the White House has also announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month a $2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
In turn, the NSF invests more than $100 million per year in artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the legislative initiative aimed at the establishment of the National Committee on Security for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
The Macedonians in the referendum to change the country's name
In a Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia. The name change would solve the debate with Greece, which has prevented the country from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
According to Greece, which owns a region called Macedonia, the name of the northern neighbour is, in practice, a territorial requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its access to membership of the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries entered into an agreement on a new proposal for a name, but according to nationalists, the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote will raise doubts as to whether voting activity will reach the required 50 % threshold in order to ensure that the result is legal.
The question in the vote was: \"Are you on NATO's and EU side with the agreement with Greece?\"
The supporters of a change of name such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev rationalise that the price should be paid in order to enable Macedonia to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
\"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,\" said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, many Members have said that they respect the result of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
Change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities were reported by 13.00 a.m.
However, the voting activity was only 16 compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of those entitled to vote finally voted.
\"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe,\" said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old who voted for the capital in Skopje.
Mr Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and her son Dushko, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, voted in the referendum on the change of name in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way to NATO and EU membership.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and put the chairs in front of the tents set up by the boycotts in front of the Scottish Parliament.
\"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the kitchen door,\" said Kavatarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, as part of the Euro-Mediterranean integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the required investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
\"In favour of a major majority voting for the amendment of the name, because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,\" said Zaev, after giving his voice.
He said, \"Yes, there's a voice that's going to grow up to our future,\"
The opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday referred to the voting activity of 30-43% in the referendum - the activity required below.
In the second survey of Telma TV in Macedonia 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they were voting for the 'yes' option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
Failure to hold the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western Government after it came to power in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, hit the whole Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling had a clear record of Brighton's defense at the Manchester City 2-0 Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made his goal look ridiculous.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentinian top player received a pass from the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field, running through three Brighton policemen.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one of the defenders and then left several others behind at the edge of Brighton's penalty zone.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton watch with a shot to the right corner of the paint of Mathew Ryan.
The city's manager Pep Guardiola told the reporters that \"Aguero has problems with his legs\"
We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Well, lucky for us, he did the goal in that time.
Still, Sterling had already given the heavenly blues an advantage in the campaign.
The painting came on 29 minutes of games.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton.
He gave the beautiful through to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few touch before sending the ball back to Sterling.
The skyscraper put the ball in the net just before the end of the line.

Scherzer wants to be a joker in a fight against Rockies.
The Nationals is out on the playoff, so why do you try to get a big start?
However, Scherzer always hopes he'll take over the pretense on Sundays against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a drop-off line. They have one victory difference in the Los Angeles Dodges in the Western series.
Rockies picked up at least his wild card 5-2 from Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division.
\"Although we have no contribution, at least we can rise to the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere of the public and the rest of the team here in Denver will create me the most demanding competition position I have encountered this year.
Why don't I take the challenge?
Nationals have not yet published their starter on Sunday, but are, according to knowledge, inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, and he'd play 34 at the start of his match and feed him on Sunday on his normal rest.
Washington's right-hand player has 18-7 profit/loss ratio this time. ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the player's nest 300 times, with a turn-on statistics of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, who at the same time spoke about the importance of Republican voting activity in foreign elections.
- All of our achievements are in play in November.
We are five weeks away from the main elections in our lifetime.
This is one really great -- not just a campaign, but a campaign full, and that's why I'm going to roll everywhere to fight for excellent candidates, he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to power by whatever means they can, and you can see their evil and evil.
They will not choose who is injured or who must be rocked so that they may enter into power. That is what they want, power, and power, but we will not give it to them.
He said that the Democrats have taken on the task of resisting and preventing
\"And it has been seen in the last four days, \"he said, calling the Democrats \"villages and evils and evils and lyings, \"
When he referred to Diane Feinstein, the audience responded to the loud talks by referring to the longest impact of the Senate Committee on Justice.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, no, I'm looking forward to a little bit, it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say what they think.
I was not surprised when my local party, the Momentum activists, supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm just the last representative of Labour to tell them I'm not welcome just because we say what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he resisted anti-Semiticism.
In my case, the motion for censure was critical of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, irony was similar to those of previous leaders.
Nottingham East Labour said on Friday that we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
The majority of the eight years that I have served as a local representative of Labour have been precisely the size of the party council on Friday.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and more friendly and gentler policy has long since been forgotten if it ever began.
It is even clearer that there is no longer any difference in opinion in the Labour Party and that every opinion is assessed on the basis of whether or not it is appropriate for the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues who had thought I shared a similar political view began to expect me to have a full translation and attitude that I would never have agreed to otherwise, whether it was national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I talk in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result of an insult in the social media, which calls for the withdrawal of my choice, for rejection of central politics, and for me to hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I know, indeed, that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I have made are of a political nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily sexist and racist insults and never stroke.
Normalisation of curvature is one of the most disturbing features of this age's policy.
Last week, Jeremy Corby insisted that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and with every censure clause or change in the choice rule, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that everything can go well.
But that's not the reason I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a result of the shortcomings of the Government of Thatcher in the single school, I have been trying to promote better public services for those most in need of them.
I've never covered my political agenda, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East's district has been surprised by my viewpoints or differences with my current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state is moving towards a brexit that affects households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my trust in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr blocker
Two last-minute goals were slightly distorted by the outcome of the match, but Ayr undoubtedly earned a victory in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table the only team of ten who have not lost any match.
The excellent defense and the more successful taking of risks was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie may be satisfied for this reason.
\"We've been challenged in our fights, and we're still undefeated, so I can be satisfied,\" he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says: “All glory to Ayr, they took risks better than we did.
At 14 minutes, Ayr went to the lead with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of the Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who gave up the Warriors, made the goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in a penalty painting, and just before the halftime he made a goal and managed to conversio in a pot, increasing Ayri's leadership readings 17-5.
But Melrose started another round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
The fight was a long delay when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and applied out of the field. During the continuation of the game, Ayr raised his leadership with Stafford McDowaall's goal, which Climo succeeded in conversion.
Captain Ayrin Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a goal that the conversio kick failed.
However, the home team answered when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from a ballless Climo hitching, and Macpherson made the paint from the Ayri maul that left the sideline.
Climo managed in a conversio kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and gave Gregor Henry the lead to finish the home team's fifth goal.
Star of the Still Game series starts in the restaurant sector
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran has been designated as the director of a licensed restaurant company and will thus also start working in the restaurant sector.
The 56-year-old actor will present Jack Jarvis in his popular BBC program, which he will script with his comedy partner Greg Hemphilli.
The twin has announced that the next nine seasons will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kierna is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to the public register information, he is listed as CEO of Adrifmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in the flourishing restaurant business of Glasgow.
\"Meri belongs to us: the native Bolivian state is trying to get back in touch with the Pacific Ocean by way of a legal act
Marines patrol the Navy base outside La Paz.
In the flag rooms of public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
The shipping bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been pushed into the catch clause: \"The sea belongs rightfully to us.
It's our duty to get it back.
In Bolivia, a memory of the coastline lost in the resource war in the 19th century by Chile is still strong – as is the longing to sail in the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest level for decades when Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
\"Bolivia has strong progress, shared spirit and perseverance, and of course a positive attitude towards waiting for a final solution,\" said Roberto Calzad.
Many of the Hungarians around the country, hoping to see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague will be in favour of – at the end of the decades of the dwindling debate – Bolivia's position on Chile's obligation to grant Bolivia an independent access to the sea.
The charismatic president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the fighting next year, will have a lot to play in the next Monday's line.
\"The return to the Pacific is very close,\" she assured me at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it decided, the situation would not change very much.
The Dutch-based UN institution does not have the power to hand over Chile's administrative areas, and ICJ has also announced that it will not impose the end of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision is only given six months after the final submission of the statements indicates that the case is not complex, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia's goal.
\"A small Bolivian regime has taken the question of sea connections,\" said Zárate.
Morales's fighting rhetoric has stifled the rest of the Chilean charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will then be very difficult to organise negotiations.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the court ruling would have been exceptionally quick.
Monday or Monday will give Bolivia an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile, and the opportunity to stop the 139-year-old differences for mutual benefit, she said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime question as a political support.
\"Bolivia will never give up her right to connect to the Pacific Ocean,\" she added.
\"The opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past\"
North Korea reported that no nuclear pollution would occur unless it could rely on the United States of America
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first, unless they can trust Washington, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States of keeping the promises made by Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's position came just before US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to reinitiate on the nuclear weapons of deadlock diplomats, only three months after the US met Kim Jong Unin Singapore.
Ri said it was a long dream to believe that the continued sanctions and the United States' opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before first taking important steps to promote the war on arms, Washington is under the control of the Declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, the view that Pjongjang would be about to give up the arms armament, which the State is likely to see as the only real means of ensuring its own security, has become highly suspicious.
There are plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump Summit.
Paris fashion screens present the latest large sized headgear in the collection, which will soon be in your immediate future.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not have to continue looking for it.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne exposed their SS19 design to a selection of special over-sized head-longs, which undermined the style circles of Paris' fashion weeks.
Very unorthodox heads captured Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows as well.
Valentino’s most epic creation was a beige hat with a broad feathersr, which covered almost completely the head of the models.
Other oversized outfits were, among other things, a watermelon decorated with jewelry, a wreathed or even annas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of unique masks – right before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips, and they reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than of top fashion.
One creature with a snorkel and mask reminded me of more diving equipment, and the other reminded me of melting ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand for a big fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of the fashion predict that the huge scarfs are about to appear in the street.
Excessive hats follow closely from Rihan to Emily Ratajkowski, with half a meter of straw hats.
In the social media, a richly visible cultural material of unpractical hat was also used for fashion performances of the second size creation – the beer-made beach case, which is almost as large as the model that carries it.
The burned orange raffiel-based white hand straps had the most striking creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 model in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a famous stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-scale hats and wristbands in the street next summer – designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale clothing.
John Edward: Language Skills are central to the world citizen
The learning results of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. The success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools, located in different parts of Scotland, represent more than 30 000 students, represented by the SCIS of private schools in Scotland, seek to provide a high level of service to their pupils and to the parents of students.
Private schools seek to prepare their students for their career, for secondary and higher education, and for world citizenship.
As a training operator who can design and implement customized learning content, we have noticed the position of languages as a popular and desirable subject in continuous educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations with people from other countries.
In the latest results of this year, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of the percentage of access between private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest rating of A.
Based on the subject, it was found that students who received the highest rating A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently free choice materials, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural materials (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
Based on a survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17% of the situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee’s job were explained by the lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote the career development of the young people's future.
The more potential jobs require language skills, the more essential these skills will be in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have the advantage of this lifelong skill in the future, regardless of what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically put a language-qualified person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent of the Iso Britannia adults were unable to talk in a foreign language, and French was the only language with a two-digit number of 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is important now for children.
In particular, learning the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposed to be important for the Isobritanians in 2020, such as Mandarins and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, there are always several language options taught by specialised teachers in private schools.
The private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future will bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Yes, the present languages should be seen as ‘national communication skills’.
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and high level of Scotland for young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the SCIS Council of Private Schools in Scotland
LeBron makes a debut on Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James's first appearance in Los Angeles Lakers' ranks is almost over.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego before the start of the season in a game to be played.
But how many minutes he really plays, he'll be seen.
\"It will be more than one, and less than 48\" said Walton Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell was saying that James was likely to play the silent minutes.
Earlier this week James was asked about his plans for the Lakers before the six matches to be played.
At this point in my career, I don't need any more preliminary matches to prepare, he said.
Time for the Trump West Virginia campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will launch a campaign for election today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five election event scheduled for next week, including compassionate targets such as Tennes and Mississippi.
While waiting for his vote in order to fill the highest court judge's free place, Trump seeks to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing a majority in Congress during November elections.
What time is Trump's Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The Trump West Virginia Wheeling event will begin at 19 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 1998.
You can watch Trump’s Western Virginia campaign event online as livestriction via YouTube by clicking below.
Mr Trump will take the view that this week's Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh's hearing, which became a serious charge of sexual harassment, which has delayed the Senate's confirmation vote every week in the FBI's investigation.
But the priority for the campaign series is to support the success of the Republican candidates in strict elections in November.
As a result, the campaign of President Trump was commented on the purpose of these next week's five events to encourage volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
The management of the Congress is so essential for his purpose that the President is prepared to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign period, Trump's anonymous representative told Reuters.
Today’s event is at Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and even the supporters can arrive on the spot from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as from the media from Pittsburgh - West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia during the month in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump supports Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has remained behind in polls.
It's not a good sign from Morrisey's point of view that the President is trying to increase his support in opinion polls, said state scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States Team shows the will to keep hope up before Sunday's alone games
After a three-sided session on Saturday afternoon four-games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-confirming power of success is a fully-fledged phenomenon in sport, players still believe it, and increasingly in tournaments such as this.
Where does this success force come with them at the moment?
\"They had six points of leadership, which narrowed down to four, so we take this success force down,\" said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experience that they have a little wind in the sails and much to encourage, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which enabled them to play together all day and received three points in four.
Spieth has been superior to the road green, leading the example.
The palms of the victory party rose as his round went forward when he managed in a critical bag to equal the match to four when he and Thomas were two points behind the two holes.
Putt that they won the 15th match followed a similar cry that gave the impression that he believed that the US team had not yet disappeared.
You have to focus really well and take care of your own fight,\" Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to influence.
The only players who have received more points when Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends of the Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but the sweet twin has won four out of four wrongs.
\"Moliwood\" was the only two who didn't make any bugs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Bring the round, and the way they give and receive energy from this ravaged audience confirms that they are Sunday's premiers. And when the sun drops in Le Golf National, another more popular player to ensure Europe's potential profit could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather both be at the same time as different thighs.
Of course, the talks about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly fell with Alex Noren into a paired Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-game in the morning.
One bug and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole so deep that they were not even close to surviving.
But on Sunday, no one's coming to help you out of the hole.
The four ball and the four game are fascinating to follow from the perspective of a couple of cooperation: what advice they give or leave without giving and how the strategy can change in the moment.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-game has shown that the US team has a battle will, although in particular in the United States it has been suspected.
Europe takes 10-6 leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they took 10-6 leadership positions in Saturday's four balls and four games from the United States.
The excellent twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory in two victory lines from the rapper Woods, and got the score high to four points today in Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who tried hard to keep the victory of Hazeltin two years ago, managed the U.S. team weakly in four ball in the morning with a 3-1 match.
The United States were a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow down the leadership.
Jim Furykin's side needed eight points on Sunday 12 to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European starter who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called one called \"Molliwood\", were the second two in Ryder Cup history after the sensational weekend, which has won four points in the first four games.
First, after breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they later completed the 5-4th even more of Bryson Dechambeau, the overwhelmingly decompressed Woods and the American beginner, Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who barely survived the two matches on Saturday was occasionally very great, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and four games, and even seven consecutives.
Justin Rose rested the morning with the four balls, but Henry Stenson and he went back into four games, but he lost 2-1 to Dust Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third.
Europe did not get everything it wanted in this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The triple-value winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They'll get a two-to-one victory in Spain from Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and later 4-3 victorys over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four games after losing two first holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team has risen from four points behind to levels at the start of double games, even though Furyk's side also has enough to maintain the victory.
However, after two days to the second best, there may be too many requests for a Sunday attack.
North Korea - in no way - disengages itself from weapons without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions only raised mistrust in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has, over the last year, taken ambitious positive measures, such as nuclear and missile tests, decommissioned the site of nuclear tests and promised that North Korea would not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States, he said.
\"There is no confidence in the United States in maintaining national security, so under such circumstances, the unilateral removal of arms is not possible;
However, despite the fact that Washington did not accept the phase-out of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for each incident, it is important that its statement on the one-sided arms conflict is not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has done before.
At the summit of the first US President and North Korea's leader in Singapore on 12 June, he referred to the joint statement that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump gave the first assurance that the Korean peninsula would be removed from nuclear weapons and that Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
\"The United States are calling for a \"nuclear removal first,\" and they have increased the pressure by sanctions to achieve their goals by force – even in opposition to the declaration of peace,\" Ri said.
-The fact that sanctions get us on our knees is an indifferent wish.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only deepen our mistrust.
Ri did not mention the plans to organise the next Kim-Trump Summit, which Trump himself stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: \"If the party demanding the arms removal had been South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have advanced to such a deadlock.
However, Ri's tone was significantly different from last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the continental regions in the United States was inevitable after Mr Trump called Kim a suicide-related man.
In the last year, however, Trump threatened to destroy completely North Korea. In this year Trump humbly praised Kim for his courage to approach the abandonment of weapons, but stressed that there was still much left to work and the sanctions should remain until North Korea gave up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he had no timeline: \"If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter,\"
China and Russia submitted that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongjang for the progress already made.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pope, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that \"The strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions should continue to be strong and without failure until we prove full, final and reinforced nuclear weapons are abandoned\"
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to halting the funding channels for ballistic and nuclear missile production in Pyongjang.
He also announced that he would return to Pyongjang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Bombeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was not smooth.
When he left Pjongjang, he described the progress that had taken place, but North Korea, however, condemned the pompeon-gang-gang-gang-gang-gang standards - only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to closing the missile base and nuclear facility at the meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month, in the event that the United States takes the appropriate measures.
The bomb says that with the corresponding measures, Kim means security guarantees to which Trump committed at the Singapore meeting and the move towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a sufficient resting course
All primary students of Harvard University attend this year's course to increase the rest of students. The course is a resistance to a macho culture flourishing at the university, where students weigh long nights with caffeine power.
According to the researcher, students from the world’s best university are often quite ignorant about basic aspects of their own well-being.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of medical science at Harvard University, who works for a dream study at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for his course to lecture on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
After reading, there was a young woman who said, 'Why do I hear about it only now, in my last year of study?'
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I find surprising, he told me in the Telegraph interview.
For the first time in this year, the course will guide students to see how true dreams support academic and sporting performance and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Medical Science at Harvard University and Vice President of University Health Services, says that the university’s completed course was organised after they had heard how students suffer from severe sleep shortages during the study week.
An hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
One section gives students a picture of the apartment room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus getting information on the effects of caffeine and light and the impact of sleep shortages on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long-term sleep loss can raise the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
\"We know that this has no immediate impact on the behaviour of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these things just as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking, even more Professor Czeisler.
All night long study marathons, according to Professor Czeisler, are still a subject of pride, and the ever-growing pressures of modern technology and students made the problem of sleeplessness a growing problem.
The professor points out that having a good and high-quality sleep should be against the stress, fatigue and anxiety of students, and even against weight gain because sleep shortages are causing a state of hunger in the brain, which is why people are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after participating in one of his courses as his first year at Harvard last year.
He tells of the course that he had opened his eyes and gave impetus to all campus students to complete the course.
He hopes that all further students will be able to complete a similar study set before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends setting up a wake-up clock for students to remind them of sleeptime in addition to waking up in the morning, and urges them to keep in mind the side effects caused by electronic monitors and LED lighting (the blue light) on clock rhythms, which may make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot won by Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again had another day of defeat when Dolly Menga's shooting through the broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox's players were going to take their first win then the February 4th game, which was fought against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard only suffered his second loss during his 18-game manager's career. Rangers remained eight points on the valolitist leader of the current Hearts.
Menga hit the ball seven minutes before midterm, and after this, the situation was no longer balanced at the downfall of the Rangers.
The Rangers fell to the sixth position as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to the third position, and in the goal line it is only Hibernia.
The Rangers may have other problems, since Calum Spence was injured during the game in the event of an object being thrown off a stranger’s eye, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard had made eight changes to the configuration with which the team had hit Ayri and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish league.
The Holt continued with the Liv 11 assembly, where the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced the result when a well-structured composition managed to punish the opponent almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the holding of the ball, Livingston was better to use the situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had an opportunity to get the goal at two minutes before the Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a freeway to the goal of Allan McGregor.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender Alan Lithgow managed only to shoot a wide rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the game on the other hand, but the last third in the game was no longer self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. Former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, however, resisted the pain of the Lassana Coulibaly suit and Ovie Ejaria’s powerless shot.
The Livingston goal in 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the hard work of the team.
The Rangers couldn't continue to do anything for Jacobs' long-term pitchers.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who could've coldly hit the ball for Menga's easy goal.
At the swap point, Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The switch almost immediately affected the game when Kent created a suitable hole for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly’s active rapid defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again, while Lithgow and Halket continued long feeds after each other.
The Dutch team had the opportunity to increase their leadership at the last moments of the game. However, the fine defense of McGregor prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could get to his positions at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who had become a Rangers exchanger, also called for a penalty kick after taking Jacobs together, but once again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geigermitari inventor
Next of our \"Sunday Morning\" Netherlands: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger, a future physique, was born today in Germany 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later resulted in the development of a geigermeter known as a geigerometer.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also the central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 movie \"Coronado Watches\", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present quite the scientists that affect cattle:
Man: What a miracle is that?
Rogers: \"It's a geigerometer. It's used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put the headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effects of radioactive radiation on minerals.
Evans: “Look!
\"Hans- Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
The idea that carries his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ the malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method will isolate resistant cells from the patient and be modified in the laboratory
After handling, the cells injected back into the body are capable of ‘seeing’ of several cancers of typical proteins
The dog tissue has produced promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, the cancer cells of a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and converted in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ to several cancers with typical HER2 proteins. The altered cells are eventually injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A. describes the method:
The HER2 guide for the growth of several types of cancer, Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West got to critics' teeth after praising Trumpics on Saturday Night Live, campaign over their heads.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West got his neck off the bouts in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after praising President Donald Trump in a squeaky style and reporting that he was the President of the 2020 election.
After presenting his third copy of the evening - Ghost Town - Trump Make America Great Again campaign, West attacked the Democrats and repeated its support for President Trump.
- Often when talking to a white man, they ask me how I can support Trumpi because he's racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have changed America a long time ago, he says.
This evening's mission began with a stroke in which Matt Damon refused to consult Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, in connection with the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual harassment of Kavanaugh.
The West pasta was not presented in direct mail, but the comedian Chris Rock downloaded it into a broken social media.
It's unclear if Rock's trying to make fun of West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public about being treated in the bowls because of the hat he held on his head.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on my head.
I've been bullied!
And then they'll say I'm in the margin. West says in the Washington Examiner interview.
West goes on to say, \"Do you want to see what the margin of living means, saying that you're wearing a Superman receipt because you can't tell what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to be loving.
According to Variety, West's comments opened up public bouts at least twice, and the show's performers seemed embarrassed. One of the present described the situation as follows: \"The whole studio was completely quiet.
The West was chosen to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by the song \"I love it\" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West will be supported by Candace Turner, director of the Conservative TPUSA, who praised this courage on Twitter:
But Karen Hunter, leader of the debate programme, said that West is just himself, which is all wonderful, and that is all.
However, I can decide whether to be a human being (by buying this music or costume or by supporting this art), which I consider to be a supportive and harmful ideology for my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us, he added.
Before his performance on Twitter last night, the kidnapper announced that he had changed his name to a person known as Kanye West.
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy here, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The second rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late Prince Prince of Music legend, who changed his name to a symbol and later as an artist who was known before Prince.
You'll be charged with attempted murder by Belfast restaurant stabbing you.
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in the Eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident was reported by the police in the Ballyhackamore area.
The accused is expected to be before the Belfast court on Monday.
The prosecution is being checked by the Public Prosecutor's Office.

Kit Harington is known for his sword - waving hero roles in the violent fantasy series of Jon Snow's HBO.
However, Harrington has attacked the stereotype of the Machosankar: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by force.
In an interview with the cultural union of the Sunday Times, Harrington doubts that the matter - something has gone wrong - is questioning the means in place to address the toxic masculine in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, too, Harrington, a 31-year-old Rose Leslie, member of the Star Card of the Revolutionary Game, admits that he has a strong desire to address the subject.
“The question of where we have gone with masculinity is that I feel strong at the moment, ” he says.
What has been taught by men in the years of their growth, which has led to problems that are now being observed,
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculine.
He goes on to say, \"What is the inner births and what has been learned?
What lessons can be learned on TV and on streets that make young boys feel that they need to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
There's something really wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the front or further parts of the Revolutionary Game after the end of the series next summer, because he has, according to his own words, been in need of fields of battle and horses.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play, True West, who will tell us about the film producer and his partner in the robbery.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future Rose wife was the best thing the Master’s Game has ever offered him.
\"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from now on,\" he says.
Rose Leslie was acting Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love played by Harrington in the Emmy award fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the premises of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections has increased by 14% in China
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have only been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through some parts of China's contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan County Conference, this has resulted in almost zero reduction of HIV intakes.
However, one year later, the number of HIV infected and AIDS patients in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
Sex through HIV is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT has been reported to be common.
The studies have estimated that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many diseases are caused by insufficient protection in such respects.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of its response to the problem.
Maxine Waters contests the data of the employee's leaked Republican absorber and blames the spread of dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied claims that his employee had published personal information about the three Republican cleaners on Wikipedia's website.
The spokesperson from Los Angeles confirmed that the claims were distributed by ‘democratic’ commentators and websites.
- Whites, lies and more disrespectful lies, says Waters in his statement on Twitter.
The published data included the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina and Senators of the State of Utah, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatchi.
An unknown person published information about the US Congress on Thursday during the hearing of the Senate Committee on the prosecution of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court member, Brett Kavanaugh.
The bleeding occurred shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Punds and RedState report that, according to the Hill newspaper, messages were published from the Waters Office's IP address and by a person belonging to Waters' staff.
This unwarranted charge is completely wrong, and it's about absolute lie, so Water's gone.
- My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised because of these false and false accusations, is not responsible in any way for the leaking of these data.
This unwarranted charge is completely false and absolutely false.
Waters's statement was quickly critical of the Internet, and critics also included the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote.
It seems that his character does not fit for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be proud.
There's no reason to question the prosecution's motives.
The condition should be moderate and calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the Thursday hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for the place of Waters in the intermediate elections in Congress, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
I can't believe this is true, he's your receipt.
Waters stated in his opinion that he had contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies for these false accusations.
We believe that the perpetrators will be exposed, he continued, and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all or all of the destructive and dangerous measures against members of my staff.
Johnny English again – a sub-active German barodia of Rowan Atkinson
It's already established a tradition to look for Brexit references from any film that comes to Britain, but this doesn't seem to fit into Johnny English agent industry and operating media series, which started in 2003 on Johnny English screen and relived in the follow-up 2011 part of Johnny English – Newborn –
Can the language of the satirs of the nation in the cheek become the new British national export success?
Either way, an asshole-eyed, round-eyed and incompetent Johnny English has earned his promise to repeat the ring. Even though his name tells us, first and foremost, that it is a colluding creature directed at the outside of the English-speaking world film market.
Of course, it's about that stupid secret agent desperate to survive the melting glamour, but it appears to be mixed up with Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the unfortunate musician at the London opening concert in 2012.
The Hahmo is based on the smooth chaos left behind by the cosmopolitan and mystical world man, whom Atkinson originally presented in the unsuspected productions of the Barclaycard TV commercials.
It'll be a moment in the last performance.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrived on helicopters dressed in a medieval armor, and the stotori's stage was a mess of his helmet.
The gifts of the Atkinson physical comedy are emerging, but humor itself seems sub-active and unusually unnecessary, especially because the ‘stacky’ film brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task today provide humor as part of the main content of the film.
The humor affects children, and I don't feel as ingenious and sharp as Mr. Bean's mike roles.
Every year, the reason for this is that Britain is in trouble for the worst time.
The cyber hacker is infiltrating the UK's top spy network and revealing the identity of all British agents in the field as a shock to an agent in service – which is presented as Kevin Eldon's unfortunate little role performance.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is already ready for his ears, in the salt of political dissatisfaction: Emma Thompson does everything in the skins of Teresa May, but the script does not provide him with sufficient space.
When notifying intelligence advisors that all the spyes on the field have been revealed, a person who has already moved away from active service must be invited to the wedding.
Of course, it is in his own person, Johnny English. He spends his retirement days as a fine school teacher, but at the same time he gives informal lessons in spying's noble skills. The topic is tightening up some clever jokes; English holds the School of Rock lessons into intelligence halls.
English is thanked for the emergency meeting at Whitehall, where he will meet again with his infinitely patient combat partner, Bough, who will continue to be played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a dive boater whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to her rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service in order to face the fatal supercrime Ophelia Bhuletovan, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is about to become the manipulative manipulative of the charismatic IT billionaire. Jason Volta, acting by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey are now turned into a farce: a double disguised as waiters will light a fine French restaurant fire and cause chaos when they seek to hide from Volta's luxury yacht. The company will become familiar with the Volta house through virtual glasses will end up in a clean anarchy in the real world.
Even the most recent evenings of the performers tend when they arrive at the final scene, but despite all the in authority and charm, the film still seems a little bit to be made to the audience.
You can think of a picture as being reasonable.
In watching Johnny English movies, I have before ended up thinking: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party contests the plans for a four-day working week at five-day pay
The Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, was thinking about a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is told to transfer savings from the company managers to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, workers could enjoy the same salary for the three-day weekend.
According to the guidelines, the idea of ‘soping’ the party's economic programme and its plans to cost the workers policy.
The Trade Union Central Organisation supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means of enabling workers to benefit from a changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Labour Party reports to the Sunday Times newspaper: “The review of the law has been announced before the anniversary.
This change will not take place at the moment, but Thursday's working week is the objective of a party's approach to balance the economy for workers, as well as to the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to moving to Thursday in connection with its referendum campaign for 2017.
However, the objective is not to receive unallocated support in the Labour lines.
According to the employer's information officer, \"A working week is not a party's line and the party does not consider such a move.
John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the shadow government, took advantage of last week's work conference to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from non-renewable dictators and entrepreneurs of companies of general interest.
According to the Ministries Minister of Finance's plans, the current shareholders of the water companies should not be allowed to recover as a whole, as the government under the Labour Government could carry out reductions on the basis of observed abuses.
He also confirmed plans to set workers at corporate boards and to create inquisitive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the private sector's share capital to the management of employees.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing the 60-minute programme of whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The investigation of charges against the FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Judge, which also raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican donors to Kavanaugh's appointment.
During the 60-minute period to be sent on Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Party Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it would be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
Then, of course, Kennedy said.
I told you I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unmistakable,
Graham's voice, instead, looks like a stone.
\"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's bombproof,\" he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it,\" said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people he appointed were able to confirm.
It's about 36 years old.
I don't see what could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held on Saturday in New York, is a music event that is as impressive as its mission: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now, for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to the New York Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Card B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real objective of the event: to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, will continue for the Global Power Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people active in eradicating poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (if it is not willing to pay the VIP ticket) the public must carry out various tasks or actions, such as volunteer work, send an e-mail to the political decision-makers or make a call, or make another act that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citizen been successful, now that we have 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of a free concert ticket to hire a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clictivism’ among others – an idea that the world can be changed by signing or sending a receipt?
Global Citizen reports the work on behalf of more than 19 million different objectives, starting in 2011.
According to this, these actions have encouraged policy-makers to report commitments and principles corresponding to over 37 billion dollars, which have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than USD 10 billion have already been spent or collected.
The Group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The most important commitments include, for example, the Power of Nutrition, the group of investors and executives in the United Kingdom, which is committed to helping children to develop their full potential. The group committed to delivering $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country. This happened after the activists sent them 4 700 TVs as a result of the Global Civilisation campaign.
Thanks to the British Government, donors, governments of different countries and people of the world like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition history to the press, the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman said to the public at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British Government was also invited to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with more than 5,000 works. The government has published funding for the Nutrition project focused on combating malnutrition, which will reach 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions asked on the website of the movement is: \"Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?
Global citizen’s answer: “This will be long and difficult, and we have many compression stones ahead of us.
We will, however, succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and the anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman run the New York concert this year, and its star map includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae.
According to the U.S. Department of Internal Affairs, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as a barrier.
According to U.S. Home Minister Ryan Zinke, which was quoted in Washington Examier magazine, Washington could, if necessary, rely on its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including in the near future.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria – the invitation of a legitimate government – are an excuse for the recognition of new energy markets in the region.
\"I believe that [Russia] is responsible for the presence of energy in the Middle East, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,\" Zinken says.
According to the Authority, there are ways and means of preventing this.
\"The United States have the ability to keep ships open with the help of their fleet and, if necessary, to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up in the world market,\" he says.
Zinke was talking to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a group that is unprofitable and profiling as a voice pipe for energy consumers in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran with that of the same thing.
\"Iran and Russia's economic alternative is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel in another, he says, and describes Russia as a circus number of one trick, based on fossil fuels.
Opinions are timely in a situation where the Trump administration has sought to improve the efficiency of the export of liquid gas to Europe and to replace it with a much cheaper Russian liquidated natural gas.
In order to enhance this, including President Trump's regime, they are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the incompatibility project Nord Stream 2 which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to Moscow's tolerance.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres of the existing pipe, to be a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the opposition to Washington is purely economic, and considers it an example of unfair competition.
“I would like to believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose its supplier, ” says Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy, of Russia, after meeting US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has led to a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial industry organisation in the country, the German industry's central association, has called on the United States to stay separate from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it very problematic that a third country interferes with our energy supply, ” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Union, recently after the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, is going to think carefully - setting up for Presidential elections in 2020
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, from Massachusetts, announced that he would take care of his position as a presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidates at an open questionnaire in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
It's time for women to move to Washington and repair our flawed regime, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom, he said, according to The Hill magazine.
After the sixth day of November, I will carefully consider becoming a candidate for President-in-Office.
Warren has assessed President Donald Trump during the opportunity to say that it is moving the country in the wrong direction,
\"I'm worried about what Donald Trump's doing to our democracy,\" he says.
Warren has played a direct role in criticizing Trump and this Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The receipt Warren wrote on Friday, I suppose we need an FBI investigation before the vote.
However, according to the opinion poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters are not in favour of setting up themselves for 2020.
According to a survey carried out by the University of Suffolk's Department of Political Research and Boston Globe, 58% of voters are unlikely - there is no support for the appointment of a senator in the Massachusetts.
32% were in favour of candidates.
More of the respondents to the questionnaire supported the appointment of former governor Dev Patrick with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other nominal democratic candidates to the 2020 elections are, for example, the former Vice-President Joe Bide and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden has stated that she has formally decided on her nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma at the Donald Trump election.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq enlisted in armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and was charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son will have to go through when he returns home, I can well identify with other families facing the consequences and injuries of PTSD that our soldiers are returning home, ” he told the public gathered in Tulsa, the Donald Trump election in Oklahoma.
Palin called arrest a ‘flow horse in the living room’ and said that his son, like the other veterans, was a little changed to his home, they would return in hard shape, and they would return to wonder if they respected what he and his partner in the army and in the Air Force have done for this country.
Track Pali was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and Dan Bennett, a police reporter in Wasilla, said that he was being charged with domestic violence and assault and assault on women and abuse of domestic violence and weapon treatment.
18 states and the Columbia Alliance support the action against the new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the Columbia Alliance are applying for change to the new line that came into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
The 18 states and allies have submitted a letter of justice to friends in Washington on Friday, and the letter supports asylum seekers who are breaking the line.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions document, which American Civil Liberties Union raised in August against the federal guidelines.
He tells his partner - and his sons from the violent gang - he was abused by the U.S. authorities who denied him asylum 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of which are home to US asylum seekers, countries where gang violence and domestic violence have spread to all levels of society.
The new United States asylum policy repealed the decision taken by the Board of Appeal in 2014 that paperless migrants could apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the General Prosecutor of the Columbia Alliance, commented in his statement on Friday that the new line of business would ignore the decades of state, federal and international law.
“The law of the Member State of accession requires that all applications for asylum be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that such an obstacle violates this principle by the letter of friends of the right.
The prosecutors also argue in the letter that access to asylum seekers is in practice detrimental to the US economy, as the entrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and will generate the necessary additional labour force.
In June, the public prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered entry judges to suspend the granting of asylum against victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
\"The place of refuge is for persons who flee from their country of origin because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or a particular class of society, or by political opinion,\" he stated on the new asylum practice in his opinion of 11.6.
The asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate survivors’ rescue efforts continue in Pala – the number of deaths found has already doubled.
The situation for the survivors is becoming more serious.
“Your house is very tense, ” says 35 - year - old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down of her hot baby at the evacuation center in the decomposed city.
- Ambulances bring new bodies for a minute.
There's no clean water.
The residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up watered stuff, and try to save what else can be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and 7,5 hospitals that have been damaged by a magnitist's earthquake are full.
Some injured people, such as Dwi Haris, who suffer from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the army hospital, where patients are treated for continuing, strong post-conceptions.
His eyes are filled with tears when he repeated how fierce an earthquake shaken the fifth floor of a hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
- We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck between the ruins of the wall, I think. Harris tells me after Associated Press, and tells me that he was in the city with his family as wedding visitors.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for provocation by propaganda reports.
The Chinese Ambassador accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, which takes place a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page commercial in the US daily paper, praising the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the entry of the China Daily newspaper in the Des Moines Register newspaper, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of being involved in the 6-11 Congress elections.
According to the US authorities speaking to Reuters, the allegations of the Trump's attempts to interfere with the US elections mean a new stage in the Washington-wide campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for a foreign government to disseminate declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an always-distorted trade war, where both parties are in turn to charge customs duties on exports to the counterparty.
According to Chinese and American experts, at the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese revenge tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador of China and long-term governor of the State of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the United States' working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China is now continuing to accelerate its provocations by publishing propaganda reports in our own free press, writing in its opinion paper published at Branstad Sunday Des Moines Register.
“At the same time, the Chinese government will benefit from the US appreciation of free word and press traditions by putting a paid declaration in Des Moines Register, ” Branstad writes.
“In the Pekking streets, however, different opinions appear only limited, and real, different opinions that the people of China may not see at all about the alarming development of their economy; this is because the media is strictly in the position of the Communist Party of China, ” he writes.
Branstad continues by stating that \"one of the largest newspapers in China was unable to publish the offer - an article he wrote, but it does not specify what the paper is about.
Kavanaugh-fisko deports female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republican top-tiers stand behind and defend Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court can, according to the analysts, cause a reaction, especially in the coming interim elections with female voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have been in large circles, and most Republicans have already expressed their desire to proceed to the vote.
“You cannot cancel these things, ” says Professor Grant Reeher from Maxwell, University of Syria, in the article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe in the last minute's offer by Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona) of angry voters about the FBI investigation.
\"Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November,\" says Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser, and the informant of the National Reform Group MoveOn on Friday, according to a newspaper in the capital city.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang - November is coming - in demonstrating the views of the Senate in the decision of the ruling Republicans of the Committee on Justice to proceed to Kavanaugh, which happened in spite of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement of testimony, Mic reports.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable,” says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in the interview on the news site.
People say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even bigger, especially in the areas of insecure female voters and younger voters, aged 18-29, who often do not vote because they do not like the President,
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans progress with confirmation even before Ford's statement of evidence against the highest court candidate in which he claimed sexual harassment.
“This is becoming a mess to the Republican Party, ” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
“This is not just a committee vote or a final vote or a question of whether Kavanaugh is being put into question, it is a question of how Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with the Fordia, Guy Cecil, the leader of the Democratic Party of the USA pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in whether they should believe in Ford or Kavanaugh’s statement of witness in a small majority tending to the latter.
According to a new opinion by YouGov, 41% of respondents strongly or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% say they believe that it is absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely to have or will definitely lied in his witness statement, whereas only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's stepped forward, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one of the other accusations made by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
In front of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Ford proved that Kavanaugh was clearly harassed by his drinking Ford when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the member of the Supreme Court has revealed to him that his body at the student party when they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventors plans to start a new internet response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of World Wide Web, has launched a startup company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source code for the Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data will be stored and who will have access to any information.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about the purpose of Inrupt's control of the world.
\"It must be done now,\" he said, referring to his start-up business.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own-personal database – i.e. POD.
It may contain contact information lists, memory lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like a Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify all available on a single browser at the same time.
In the personal data storage, it is unique that it is entirely closed by the user who has access to any type of data.
The company calls it \"to enter into force by personal data\".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to give resources, processes, and the necessary skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently consists of a safety platform purchased by Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM, some hired developers working with the project, and a community composed of voluntary coders.
Technology developers from around the world can create their own distributed applications using the tools available on the Intruct website. This is all available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking about whether people should be offered a complete change, where all their business models will be turned to their heads together at night.
We don't ask them for their consent.
The article Berners-Lee, published in Medium on Saturday, wrote that the Inrupt task is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the coherence and quality of the new Solid network.
In 1994 Berners-Lee mulled the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology University.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, also after the launch of Inrupt.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the network – Berners-Lee added.

Freeman’s friends waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – TV channel showed Pipsa Possu
Imagine the situation where you've been watching all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not even the whole event will be presented.
The San Jose event program had 13 matches, six main series matches, and the show was intended to be a live broadcast on Channel 5 in Britain.
Six in the morning, just as Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring of the program turned Pippsa Possu into a great shock of viewers.
Some viewers were not really happy when they were up all night watching because of the fight.
A free match friend opened up on Twitter to replace the match with a sick joke drawn by children.
According to the Law, this content was not suitable for presentation at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to exchange it for the children’s programme, as explained by Dave Schwartz, the older director of Bellator’s marketing and communication programme.
- Oh, my God. - Pippy, yes.
Scott Coker, director of the Bellator company, said that timetables will be worked to allow the British viewers to follow the events in the future.
- I'm thinking of a rescheduling, which is probably gonna make the program work, Coker said.
\"But the bell is six in the morning, and we must not present the program until Sunday for our time, which in turn is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed their heads, messages began to go in the direction and towards the other, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not, however, a legislative matter.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We cut the number of matches from five to six, as usual. We tried to offer more to our fans and tried too much.
This is a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to her sexuality
A swimmer and an Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells me that he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that he didn't see him until he came to high school, that \"all are not the same as me,\"
Daley, speaking in the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs programme, spoke to Lauren Laverne about the rights of gays in order to give others hope.
He also tells us how, after having a child, winning at the Olympics was no longer so important.
A long-term radio program, Kristy Young, has taken several months off because of the disease.
When he presented himself as a guest in Laverne's first programme, Daley told me that he felt young ‘more than all the others,’ because ‘it was not socially acceptable to regard boys and work as well as boys’.
He says: “To this day, these feelings, feeling less and different have been the reality, and they have given me the strength and the energy that I have needed to succeed.
He says he wanted to show himself ‘somebody ’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality eventually became exposed.
The two-time Olympic propagandaist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he appears in the National Community competitions this year to appeal to the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give ‘ hope’ to other people.
The triple world champion tells of his love for a man – the American film maker of Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 as a surprise.
Daley married this himself 20 years old Oscar winner last year, but says that the age difference has never been a problem.
If you experience so many things when you were so young, you took part in your first Olympics when you were 14 years old, and your father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone of the same age that's been through the same kind of sympathies and conflict,\" says Daley.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which the whole Daley perspective has changed.
If you'd asked me last year, my life would have run around winning a gold medal, he says.
You know, there are bigger things than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie's my Olympic gold medal.
His son got his name after Daley's father, who died in 2011 of only 40 years of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley was asking about about the 2012 Olympics' entrance tickets.
I couldn't tell him he's not gonna be here anymore to be in the front row, so Daley says.
\"I kept him out of the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he had actually stopped breathing, and he was dead, \"I finally realized that he was not unharmed,\" he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won the Bronze.
I knew this was something I've dreamed of my whole life – jump in front of my audience at the Olympics.
This was also an inspiration for his first play in sending a copy of the Heather Scribe, a copy of the Heather Scribe, which made him feel even when preparing for the Olympics, and which is still getting his skin on the chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be sent on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Polishman Mickelson exchange bench on Saturday in Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup tour, but he must be deceiving significantly in order to avoid remaining in the record as an unfortunate performance in history.
Mickelson, who plays at a two-year event every two years, for the record 12 times, was transferred from Captain Jim Furyki to the exchange bench for the time of the fourball and the foursom to be played on Saturday.
In general, the American five-time major tournament winner, who is at the centre of the attention, now spent half of the day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to take over.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even at the top of his career as one of the most specific drivers, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-growing bearer is punishing himself for inaccurate punches.
If there is not enough resistance against Mickelson himself, the British Open winner, Mr. Francesco Molinari, will be able to play with the new new Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to plant all four winning pipes this week.
If the Americans, who have four points left with 12 doubles, get a flying departure, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, but whatever else could be said.
\"He fully understands the role in which he played today, and he killed me in the back, a bit, and said he was ready for tomorrow,\" Furyk said.
He's got a lot of self-confidence.
He is definitely one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought that was all I could think of, but this is how it went and we ended up with this kind of a solution.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else.
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldon's record of several of the played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It may also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Furykin says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he's funny at people's expense, and he's a funny guy everyone likes, he explains.
I'm sure younger players had a good time with him this week.
He brings as much more to the team as I can only make his contribution to the game.
The European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the leadership can disappear quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that before the last day's double games, Ryder Cup can become a busy trip.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros was led by five points in comparison with the Americans, but who survived to win with the turkey lines just and just at the size of his nose and won at the highest possible margin from 141 to 2 to 31 to 2.
“It reminds itself of how we led the fieryly in Valderrama, we led in the Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit scarcely,” said Bjorn, after seeing the team’s 5-3 winnings on Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-20 in the Le Golf National field.
History will show me and all other members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we aim only at it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side. However, we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world,
Happy to see how his team's players are from a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I will never lick before he falls on such matters.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow there will be individual performances, and we will talk about different things.
It is great to be in the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is on its own, the player’s capacity will be tested at the bottom.
This is a message that must be delivered to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now we need to give up a partner who can get him to go to the field alone and do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk from the other side will be required to perform better as individuals than they could as partners. By way of derogation from this is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last day's full translations in both directions, and he was involved in the team that won Brookline before the European team ended up losing.
I remember every bad word he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team handed out his team's lines to the home of the last day.
\"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it is put together, it is a powerful source of pressure on the middle games.
We've adjusted our configuration accordingly and put the boys on the field the way we want to, as you know, we're going to do wonders tomorrow...
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead a defence struggle and he meets Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are on the line next to their European opponents.
I put the guys in the group in this order, because I think it will pass the tournament, Bjorn commented on his choice of two-games.
The new German warship will be delayed again
The German fleet's latest fregat should have been introduced in 2014 with the aim of replacing obsolete equipment from the cold war, but it will be put into service next year at the earliest due to defective systems and explosive expenditure, with local media reporting.
According to the military informant speaking to the Die Zeit, ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the first vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg Fregatti class has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have been persecution of an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen class Fregates.
According to available information, they are equipped with effective cannons, missile systems to combat aircraft and surface ships, as well as tail technology, such as radar reflectivity, and technology that reduces the detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The important features of the ship also include its longer service interval – the new Fregats should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without going home.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the warships at the top of the technology – which are said to have increased German influence in the overseas regions – are already obsolete at the time they enter service, the Die Zeit magazine points out.
The bad-ass F125-fregetti ended last year when the German fleet officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the shipyard of Blohm & Voss.
This is the first time the fleet returns after it has been delivered.
For reasons of return, we know little, but the media in Germany has talked about essential software and equipment failures, which make the warship an impossible task.
Software deficiencies are of particular importance because the size of the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ships is around 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen class Fregates.
It also became apparent that the vessel is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting fleet’s potential for subsequent updates.
Its capacity is believed that Rheinland-Pfalz, with 7 000 tonnes, is twice as heavy as the ships of the corresponding class used in the Second World War in Germany.
In addition to the flawed equipment, the whole project's price list is also developing a problem.
The price is estimated to rise to a shocking amount of EUR 3.1 billion when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of accessing new Fregats have arisen when the German maritime authorities have recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, earlier this year, pointed out that the fleet's usable vessels are running to a minimum.
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time due to the removal of old ships, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained about the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg class Fregat could be used by the fleet.
An environmental organization is listening to the hidden life of toys.
A new study in the area above Scotland seeks to find out how bats exploit the countryside in hunting food.
New research is hoped to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide them in future conservation measures.
The research carried out by the National Trust for Scotland scientists is monitored for trouble-and-tip boxes, as well as for earmuffs and water wings in the area of the Inverewe Garden of the botanical garden in Wester Ross.
The study sets out special storage equipment for the area’s important points to monitor the operation of the toilets during the period.
Organ workers and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of voting and the type involved will be ensured by an analysis of experts.
On the basis of the results, an environmental map and a report on the behaviour of bats will be drawn up in a picture of the size of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's conservation advisor hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are the most important for bats, and how different species will take advantage of them.
Knowledge is helpful in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and associated species.
The lepa populations of Scotland and all of Britain have decreased significantly over the last hundred years.
Building and construction works threaten the resting areas and habitats of toilets.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, including fly paper and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to the methods of hunting in the night, their ears will benefit more from catching catches than from the eyes.
The bats use advanced echo positioning techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation focused on the protection of the rural environment that maintains more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares across the country – and they take their rests seriously.
It employs ten experts regularly carrying out surveys, inspections of rest places and, in some cases, rescue measures for animals.
The organization has even established the first and only one of Scotland's leprosy areas for the protection of bats in the area of Dumfries and Galloway. Eight of the ten leprosy oils in Scotland are met in the area.
According to Nurse David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
\"Threave fits the bats very well,\" he says.
\"We have old buildings and trees and a good living environment overall.
We don't know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other organization areas will help us understand what bats need to succeed.
He stresses the importance of reviewing buildings in the event of bats before taking up rehabilitation, because the destruction of one resting place can intentionally cause up to 400 female bats and the death of a young child and destroy a whole local population.
Restorations are protected animals and their killing, interference or the destruction of resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Leaking Organization, encourages the public to participate in protection work.
He says, \"We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers prepare a court case against the German magazine
Cristano Ronaldo has identified him as a victim of sexual assault and says that people want to advertise themselves by using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have filed claims to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in the lasvegasian hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid $375 000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In Instagram, only hours after the allegations were made. 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the accusations and described them as \"false\".
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, lying news, five times the Ballo d'Or winner said to the camera.
They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine, and the player kept smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing the challenge of Der Spiegel's claim that they have called the Reuters News Office - ineligible reporting on suspicions of privacy protection -
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, says that the player is demanding compensation for the psychological suffering according to the seriousness of the infringement, which probably means the serious violation of the personal rights of the past years,
The alleged event is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hospital in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reported to have been in the club of the night and to the room of the player who claimed to have raped this analystically, according to the papers submitted to the Regional Court of Nevada by Clark County.
Mayorga claims that following the alleged event on his knees, which fell, and reported that he was 99% good, but one percentage point of which failed.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple of having sex, but it was about mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he had visited the police station and took photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in the conciliation settlement, because he was, in his fear, the possibility of revenge and concern of public humiliation.
A 34-year-old says now that he is applying for annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized about the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault on Manchester United, and was transferred to the Italian power team in Juventus with a $100 million agreement.
Brexit: The UK would always regret the end of car manufacturing
If it were to lose its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after brexit, Minister of Industry, Greg Clark, said.
He added that he thought it would be a vigour - the announcement by the United Kingdom Unit in Tokyo to temporarily suspend production at its factory near Derby in Burnaston if Britain were to withdraw from the EU without an agreement.
- We need a deal, Clark says.
A Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of the border delays will be seen as a loss of jobs if it is concluded without a contract.
The Burnaston factory – which produces the Toyotan Auris and Avensis models – has manufactured nearly 150 000 cars last year. 90% of these were exported elsewhere to the European Union.
My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will be interrupted,\" says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Burnaston Unit.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about the exit from the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its mini factory for a month when brexit is completed.
The main concern is that the car manufacturers report risks related to the supply chain in the implementation of the contract-free brexit.
Toyota's production line is run with the timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in Britain and in the EU, and cars are made from the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can cause disturbances at the border which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It is impossible, according to Toyota, to hold a storage warehouse for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, and production would be interrupted.
Clark says that Theresa May's EU relations plan is well calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.
We want the best possible agreement, which is not only about success in the current situation, but about the opportunity that we need to make use of, he says, the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
Not only the statements from the other manufacturers, but also the opinions of the Toyota, we must definitely be able to continue the series of very well-functioned supply chains.
Toyo cannot tell us how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the institution and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and works as an operator of the trade union at the factory, says: “The jobs lost in my experience will never return.
The government informant says: \"We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU:
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House will announce:
The challenging meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be transferred to another week.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn examines Russia's involvement in elections, Trump's assistant contacts with Russia and the President's possible activities to prevent justice.
There have been rumors in Washington over months about Trump's intention to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported to Rosenstein about the opportunity to record secretly discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of separating the President on the basis of Appendix 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has challenged the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has been reported to have been the resignation of Rosenstein.
At that time, however, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would rather not separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because the date coincided with the hearing of the Senate Committee on Justice, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both Witnesses.
On Friday Trump ordered a week's study of the FBI against Kavanaugh, which continued to delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press chief, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News's Sunday program.
When he asked about the Rosenstein meeting, Sanders said: \"The daily number for this is not set. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed even more a week because of everything else, due to what is going on in the highest court at the moment.
I'd like to keep the press up-to-date.
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The news guy, Chris Wallace, asked me why.
Sanders says that the reason for the shortage of press conferences is due to other reasons than the dissatisfaction with TV suppliers' attention, but he said: \"I do not dispute the fact that they are looking for attention.
But Sanders understood the future of direct contact between Trump and the press.
\"The President keeps more Question hours than any president before him,\" he says, and he adds more evidence from the book: \"We've checked those numbers...
\"A conference will continue to be organised,\" Sanders said, \"but it is extremely much better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We try to do this often in this way and you have seen us act this way several times over the last few weeks, and this will be replaced by a press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States,
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or participating in open events or press meetings with visiting values.
The performance alone at a press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the President may have pointed out the reason for this when he appeared incessantly and in time for strangely assembled journalists.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to the staff of Scotland in the EU regarding the fears of brexixit.
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the staff of the Scottish healthcare system from EU countries in order to express their gratitude and hopes for staying in the country after brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter while the time has remained for the UK to resign from the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already made provision to cover the costs of EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes as follows: During the summer the distinction negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in autumn.
The United Nations Government has also enhanced preparations for a non-agreementable difference.
I know this is an uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate each of our workers' contributions to citizenship without looking at them.
Colleagues from all over the EU and from outside it bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head trauma
Tenssee State Tigers team sponsor Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team was destroyed 31-27 Vanderbilt for Commodores on Saturday, reports a journalist of Tennis's Mike Organ.
The main coach of the Tennis State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury had taken place just before the middle of the day.
He came to the sideline, and he just fell for it, so Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombi an oxygen at the sideline before putting him on the pairs and taking him for further evaluation.
Tensee State's editor told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel supplier in Nashville, Pennsylvania that Abercrombie had reached the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that there is no information on the type or extent of the infringement at this stage, and that the Tennis State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at the Tennis State University and plays in his first-time team from Illinois after his move.
He had five fights on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when purchasing real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in Britain. Additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new plans.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in the levy applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to GBP 120 million a year – to help homeless people
Theresa May will today inform foreign buyers of the higher stamp tax rates when they buy properties in Britain. The extra money is used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of the people of good income.
The rise in the levy will be directed at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money from this will be channelled into government efforts to facilitate the unoccupied distress.
An additional charge – which will be added to the current stamp tax two years ago in addition to the second-in-house and investment housing increases – can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London’s new buildings will be bought on a regular basis by non-United Kingdom residents, thus increasing prices and making it difficult for first-house buyers to have their own dwellings on the market.
Many of the wealthy territories in Britain, especially in its capital, have become ‘aspirations’ because many foreign estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will only come for weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a lowering of the stamp tax as a means of facilitating the purchase of young people’s first homes.
He accused large construction companies that they would keep the prices of buildings high by buying land and leaving it unconstructed, and urged Prime Minister May to reject the quotas for low-cost housing in order to correct the shameful situation in Britain's dwelling.
Corby has published a series of suggestions for reforming the housing market, including the restrictions on rents and the end of the self-consumption.
He would also like to give more authority to the council in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year that I was going to own the British Prime Minister's dream – that every generation should be better than its predecessor’s – return.
This means fixing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK and companies abroad can buy housing as easily as those who live in the UK.
Too many people having a home has become a dream far too far away, and shame of homelessness remains the reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to manage the Scottish national team.
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, says his very own goal is to become a manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enthusiastic at the challenge of raising the country’s north-east corner back to its feet. The team is currently in the third place in the UK’s second division.
Ross moved to the stadium of lights this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to Scotland's valoliga in the last period.
As a player, I wanted to play my country on the team.
I got to team two, and that's it, Ross says in the BBC: Scotland's Sports Sound.
When I was a kid, I used to watch my father's games with Scotland in Hampden, and it's something that's always pulled me back.
This is the only chance that will happen if I succeed as a manager of the company.
The predecessors of Ross, Sunderland, include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
He has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
\"Today, I will measure my own success as to whether I can restore this company to the Valoligaga.
Based on the structure and ability of the Society, it is undoubtedly a matter of choice, he says.
- It's not easy, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could trust a team to return to the menu.
Ross has only served as a manager for three years, first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats Coach Group.
He then helped Alloa to get out of the third series of fall games and raised St Mirren's falling condition as champions during the next period.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his game career in the teams of Clyden, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
I was probably on the roadside with my career, and he'll remember the time when he moved to Alloa.
- I believed I was more suitable as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, I made a good career, and I got to enjoy some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to figure out a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things as stress and pressure from work, but running the team seems exactly the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for my job, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.
The whole interview will be listened to at Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland from 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the chair is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., the study shows
The heat wave in the summer has fired the pubs that struggle with British difficulties, but at the same time combined more pressure on the food chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, while the income of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures compiled by Peter Martin of the Business Consultant Company CGA say: “The continued solar weather and England’s expected longer participation in the football World Championships meant that July became more like pubs when the sales of pubs were 2.8% higher, while the month was worse for restaurants.
The fall of 1.8% in summer in restaurants only deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were most successful and their like-for-like sales increased more than the decline in the sales of restaurants.
The food-focused pubs also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than the food-stricken restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted to get out drinking in their minds.
Sales of business-rounded pubs and bars increased by 6.6% during the month, and sales of food were three per cent lower.
Paul Newman about the leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services, RSM says: “The results continue the trend that has continued since the end of April.
The weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is no surprise that the fight against the chain of restaurants continues, although the reduction in annual sales of 4.8% will be painful, especially now that the sector is struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come for those who were fed with the worse sauna, and only time would it be for them to show if the cooler temperatures of the industry were to bring to the fast breathing stage.
The combined sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer for the sale of the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which collects and analyses output data from 47 competent groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds.
A fifth of children conceal social media accounts from their parents
The fifth part of children – some of which are up to 11 years old – hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, says the study
The study of 20,000 upper secondary school pupils revealed the existence of an increasing ‘Instagram’ feature
The news raised concerns about the distribution of sexual content in the accounts
20 percent of the students said they liked ‘head account’, which is shown to parents
A fifth of the children, some of which are up to 11 years old, are creating social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The study of 20,000 upper secondary school pupils revealed the rapidly growing “Instagram’s play accounts, which refer to the Instagram site for the sharing of images.
The news has raised fears that sexual content can be published on the accounts.
20 percent of the students told them to keep clean ‘headtail’ for parents while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping that she would be raped after colliding with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
In a study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors’ Advisory Board (HC), 40 % of young people aged 11 to 18 held two separate profiles and half of respondents granted secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of the HMC, says: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are attracted to creating online facilities where parents and teachers cannot find them.
The voice of the Eilith Doyle athletes - the Government of Scotland's athletes
Eilith Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Government of Scottish athletes, who will attend the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most awarded athlete in Scotland. Ian Beattie, President of the Board, describes the appointment as a fine opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive experience of the athletes during the last decade.
\"Elidhi is highly respected with athletes in Scotland, Great Britain and internationally, and I am sure that Scottish athletes would gain enormous benefits from his appointment to the government,\" Beattie says.
Doyle says: “I look forward to my role as a athlete’s voice box and hope that I can be of benefit and help to guide Scottish sports in the right direction.
The four American athletes who won the Olympic gold medal, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, now operating as a regular commentator of the BBC, lost their ability to walk as a result of a passing brain blood circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: \"A month ago, I had a stroke...
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say it's only time to show you, I'll recover and where to recover.
This has been a exhausting work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now to work on agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages.
Moms cows parallel ad distributes opinions online
The breast pumping company’s breast-feeding mothers’ breast-feeding advertising has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who makes consumer technology, has placed on the market a product called “the first silent and top-published breast pump in the world – its marketing is accelerated by a language made in the cheek and adapted to the style of music videos, which describes the freedom of the new pump to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers danced in the navet of hens, including the next song, saying: “Yes, I milk myself, but he doesn’t show up, and if you didn’t notice, they’re not raspberry, but they’re tits.
The story goes on to say: \"Pick it out, pull it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pull it out, milk my flames,
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company caused a debate online.
A video of 77,000 views and hundreds of comments has raised a conflicting reaction to viewers. Many say it will ruin the daily ‘worsts’ of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows in advertising this product was a very poor decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, but their babies are stolen soon after birth, and one commentator writes.
Elvie breast pump is an undetectable match in the breast-feeding vest (Elvie/Mother)
Another viewer commented: \"I understand it's traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they be used to advertise a chest pump for mothers who can keep their baby?
The third commenter added: \"Access to the full reality of advertising\".
Adinos also gave me defenders: a woman admitted that she thought the commercial was \"supreme\".
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I were still breast-feeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
I mean, advertising's a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product. He reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who pump (often work or toilets) and feel like cows.”
The purpose of advertising is not to praise or condemn the milk industry.
At the end of advertising, the women of the video reveal that they have danced undetectable pumps in their bras.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, instead, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and it fits unnoticedly in the suckling vests, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby, and even go out during their pumping.
Ana Balar, a shareholder and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office commented: “Elvie pump is a mutilating product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By cleaveing suckling mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump into the light screen, we brought out the sense of incredible freedom that the new pump brought out in an entertaining and similar way.
Elvie's pump's been in the headlines before.

Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in all silence
In spite of the fact that the monthly number of cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, this is due to the fact that, as a result of the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, children's investment in foster families has become more difficult.
Most foster families have traditionally composed of paper-free immigrants, and registration as a foster family may jeopardise their own residence in the country.
The risk was increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential substitute families and other adult members of the economy had to hand over their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, the High Level Entry and Customs Authority, last week in Congress, witnessed dozens of people who had applied for foster families with minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
\"Although 80% of the people who are either a replacement family member or members of their households are illegally present in the country and a large proportion of them are criminals abroad.
So we keep looking for these people, Albence says.
In order to speed up the handling of children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules according to which, in some cases, the case must be dealt with in the court within a month of the 60-day period before the arrest, the staff of the reception centre shall report.
Many people would rather be present through a video conference than personally when they run their case before a court on immigrants.
Those who are not considered entitled to help are quickly expelled.
According to reports published by employees in reception centres and in recent months of the system, the time spent in prison for children affects whether children are beginning to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent discharges or forced attempts.
According to lawyers, concerns arise especially in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s despair may be overlooked due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without having enough time to prepare for it emotionally or with good-bye friends can cause trauma, and that many children already suffer trauma at the moment.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey to leave immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country was at war for eight years.
Mr Moualem, who is also in place of the Prime Minister, said that the foreign troops were in the country illegally using the excuse of the fight against terrorism, and that – with them they will be operated accordingly –
\"They must withdraw immediately and without any condition,\" he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the anti-terrorist war was almost over in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight holy until all Syria has been cleaned of both terrorist organizations and acts of foreign forces.
In the United States, there are some 2 000 soldiers placed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Kurds and Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested more than 1,000 military units in fighting to tear down the country.
On the refugee issue, Mr Moualem said that conditions were good for the return and accused some Western countries of spreading alarmary fears, which encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
\"We have invited the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns,\" he said.
-They are politicalizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian,
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone at the last rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces supported by Russia, where three million people live.
However, Mr Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear time limits and expressed the wish that military action would be directed at the jihadists, including the al-Nusra front warriors associated with al-Qaida, to be destroyed.
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to invite the first meetings of the Committee of the New Government and the opposition to establish and balance the post-war Syrian Constitution for elections.
Moualem set up the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution and warned that it would interfere.
Why Trump is elected for another season
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, formalisation and scandal to decide his presidency in good time.
This would undoubtedly be the decision of the dramatic presidency ever-
No signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers so far.
Since 2014, the figures for the best viewing time have doubled by CNN 1.05 million and almost tripled with 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Fox News, Nielsen, on average, there are 2.4 million viewers compared to 1.7 million people back four years, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has reached the peak of 3.5 million viewers on top of the newscasts.
\"This is a grass that attracts people because it is something we do not understand,\" says Neal Baer, the leading producer of the ABC Designed Survivor programme, \"of a minister who will be the president of the destroyed congress building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced a comedy writer and a book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club author, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scevell asked me why.
The driver said, \"Because he makes me laugh,\"
The chaos has its worth.
Of course, by way of other TV programs, news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade is involved, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy can.
Independence is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the responsibility of the well-known citizen to look at a six-hour expert panel arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 strutsin leather pilotatat (Washington Post) as well as the prejudice of his clothing, and Stormy Daniels for the consequences of the undefeated illustrations of President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario again in the same way that I used to.
“What he does seems to be doing is because it is partly about giving the public something every night, ” says the Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the President of the Pantilaamamo creator Brent Montgomery Trump’s show of changing persons and daily trends (NFL-ritty, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't miss any episodes, or you're gonna lose your cart.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a wonderful sunny day on the northern coast of Kaai, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while laughing at CNN.
He could not remove himself from the programme in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and this was the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Money from the outside for tight snacks
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has encountered a real cash flow, as two candidates who have already been elected have to fight one place because of the restructuring of the congressional districts.
This newly redefined Pietsburg electoral district is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took place in the special elections last spring from the second district.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th constituencies of Pennsylvania, which is overlapping with the new 17th constituencies.
The division was redeployed after the highest court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old electoral division favoured Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th Electoral District has launched an economic struggle in the main finance departments of the Democratic Campbell Congressional Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb's name was known in Pennsylvania after the 18th congressional special elections in Pennsylvania.
The place had been on Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump in the region won 20%.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a fine lead.
The United States was planning a penalty for El Salvador for supporting China, but it retreated from its intentions.
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already listed the situation in Beijing and the mild reaction to Washington.
President Trump had a warm welcome meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until his partners banished the Trump Organisation Group's management teams.
The US Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to call the US diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the high-level guidelines that said that Taiwan would no longer be recognised, said in their opinion earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million of assistance from the United States in 2017, was considered to include drug control, as well as development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American State with a high level of unemployment and death.
In the course of the internal meetings, the North and Central American authorities postponed the high level of security and economic prosperity.
In mid-September, however, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was to proceed and that this decided effectively to speculate about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
The vice-president, Mr Pence, is now expected to give some sort of indication to the mid-October meeting about the importance given to the meeting by the diplomats.
These three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in all silence, without any new bad messages or penalties from Washington.
The informant of Bolton's White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs with my anonymity.
Their report confirmed an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the field of protection of anonymity.
History Teaching
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of the right of President Trump, which now has very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported as a leading investigation of whether Trump’s campaign is to be kept secret in cooperation with Russia when Russia became involved in the US elections.
If power turns to Congress, President Trump will notice that he is accountable to it just when preparing to go back to his constituents and possibly be condemned by his peers.
There are many whispers here, and I do not mean to say that President Trump's defeat would be inevitable, more than the loss of the corresponding people in Europe.
We must make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been prepared to take over Hitler's power if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the massacre of the years that followed.
The course of history goes on to such places where the undefeated march of democracy is either accelerating or delayed.
The Americans now face a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been degraded since he became aware of the fact that he had proposed a secret record of the President's speech and that he might not be able to take care of his duties.
Rosenstein says that The Times's report is incorrect.
How do we react if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh’s activities is not complete or just - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we voting in the interim elections for a Congress that considers President Trums responsible?
If we fail in these homes, our democracy will last for a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success in Prague because of the lesson I've learned.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, and she was banished by the same Nazi government who once filled my diplomat bag.
He survived, moved to America and sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated with a hammer.
How can I have more than optimism for the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans as an optimistic Rapid Vienna encounter
The Rangers encounters their home of Rapid Viennan on Thursday, knowing that earlier in the same month in Spain after the game against Villarreal, the victory of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter the G-block of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that as a starboard for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer, ” says the 31-year-old player.
\"We went to the game waiting for us to get something and bring a point with us.
Perhaps we could have caught a profit at the end, but overall the tie is probably a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half, and we got on the other side, and we were better.
Thursday is again facing an important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because their score was good in the last game. However, I believe that with this group we can do everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on what would happen to my own injuries and changes on the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy it; the training is fine.
I hope that we can now put the full weight on it, leave the past period behind us and succeed.
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep
Although the research participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, only a few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the transnational study reported discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they talked to their children about it.
People want family members to take care of them, but they don't want to talk about it, says Holly Snyder, Deputy Director of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your mate and your children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you tell them about your wishes in time.
Talk to your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important cost factor.
Take economic advice into account in the debate: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
For example, long-term treatment options may be traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance for these costs, or self-employed insurance if you have a reservation.
Load legal documents: prevent disputes.
Get a health care representative in order to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the preparation of a proxy for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine the person you trust to take care of financial decisions for you and to ensure that your invoices will be paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember small details: Imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Would you be able to answer his questions about medicine and allergies?
Write such information into the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
Who's his doctor, Martin's asking?
- What drugs are being used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Keep your plan ready.

Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect of the eight terrorist attacks in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 on a federal crime.
According to the charges, Saipov, 30, used Home Deposit's rental car in his loot attack on the road to West Side Highway, the southern part of Manhattan, where he drove over pedestrians and bikers.
According to the report on the death penalty in New York's southern administration, if the prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed - with due consideration - eight of his victims and caused, in a targeted manner, serious physical injuries.
According to the case-law document, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal law imposed a 22-point prosecution against Saipov, including eight murders to assist the terrorist organisation, typically using this criminal term in cases of organised crime, including charges for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack called for a considerable amount of planning and preparation, and the prosecutors stated and described the way in which Saipov committed his actions to be horribly, cruel and shameful.
“Sayfullo Habibulavic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Aleksandr Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For the previous time, when the right of the southern jurisdiction in New York has given the death penalty, it has been for a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to the death penalty in September 2009.
The death penalty was last implemented in New York in the federal case of 1953, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed in condemnation of the conspiracy for spying the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in a chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He said to the investigators his actions seemed good, the police told me.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had received inspiration after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He was charged with a 22-point prosecution.
David Patton, one of the federal defence attorneys representing the Saipov, said the defense was inherently disappointed.
\"We believe that the decision to demand death penalty and not recognition and life sentence without the possibility of being released is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to the parties,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defense had asked earlier not to be subject to the death penalty.
The Conservative Parliamentary says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Mr Farage today, in a demonstration against the Conservatives, promised to mobilize the civil army.
The former Ukrainian leader said that politicians must know the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, the Conservative liner, stated to the Martians in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be outside if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But May will face the avoiding of its deeply divided lines by agreeing to the challenge of remaining Conservatives who joined a separate demonstration in the city against brexit.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep Chequers' proposal on the surface of its supporters and opponents of brexit, as well as the EU's squeeze.
The supporters call on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the setback, and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said that at the Leive Means Leave event in Solihull, he wants to stop the Chequers proposal from going.
He suggested that Farage should be included and that this should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
Wellingborough's parliamentary representative added: \"I want to talk about brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal.
He expressed his EU response by saying: \"We did not fight World Wars to end our subjects.
We want to legislate our own laws in our own country.
The idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: \"The fact that the British had changed their minds and that they would like to remain is a perfectly incorrect claim:
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative brexitist, also took part in the march and said to the reporters: \"Sanon only: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, neither will it be supported by party members nor by activists who really go to the streets and are primarily responsible for our success.
Now, back off the Chequers proposal, and start listening.
In a message addressed to May, he added: \"The ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises...
Farage said that politicians should be under pressure if they are to cycle the decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is a matter of trust between the people and the political class, he said.
They're trying to water Brex and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it.
When he spoke to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians, who are about to spin the brexite, to feel the pressure from you people,
\"We are going to mobilise the army of the citizens of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is again an independent, self-managed and proud state,
In the meantime, the supporters marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists tore out \"Tories Against Brexit\" signs, set up this weekend.
The Labour Party Lord Adonis mocked the conservative security problems that these had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
\"These are the people who say they're getting IT systems in order and all technology for the Canadian plus arrangement and uncontaminated border operations for free trade in Ireland,\" he added.
It's a full farce.
There's no good brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential candidates.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he's seriously considering the presidential candidates after November's election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Masschustic Democrats spoke of their future in the city hall in the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, meets the joint president of the Republican Geoff Diehl in November 2016 by Trump’s 2016.
Warren has been presumed to stand up for Trump in the 2020 elections.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was with his 36th townhouse voters after the beginning of Trump's season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it is now time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken regime, and that includes a woman at the highest place.
Arrest in case of shooting of LSU Sims
Louisian Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that they arrested a person suspected of being shot on Friday by the LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims' death.
Baton Rouge police announced Dyteon Simpson, 20 at 11 a.m., at an ET briefing.
The police had released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help to identify the man in it.
Sims, 20, shot near the campus area at Southern University early on Friday.
\"Wayde Sims got shot at the head and died as a result, chief of police Murphy J. Paul informed the media on Saturday through 247 Sports.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was in the interrogation, held the gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't do the resistance when he was arrested, and he was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
The Sims was a 198-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 games in the last season, and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 record balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vetel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that Mercedes' team arrangements play an important role in competition.
Bottas got off the stake and left Hamilton almost to his own fortune in defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting his teammates to attack him.
Vettel went to the shadow first and left Hamilton to drive a group of tails, which should have been resolved.
Mercedes went to the shadows later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton passed after a little contact and the Ferrari transporter moved counter-productively from the inner line, giving up his defence of his investment after his two third translations.
The 21st birthday of Max Verstappe began with the hives and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition when he extended the exchange of tyres to a quick stop and to take his fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the shadow in the 44th round, but could not increase speed in the remaining eight rounds when Räikkönen took his fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he got past me.
The team has done an extraordinary job in reaching a double win,\" Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein's claim that she did not pour out Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which this accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When he spoke on the occasion in Western Virginia, the President did not mention Mr Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Justice, but said that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of the human infidelity, cruelty and dishonesty.
The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the past few days, when we saw the rage, the people that are angry, the mean, the bad and the dishonest, the president said.
“When we see publications and bedtime things, and then they say “O, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you guys all these years?
Do you remember his answer... are you years of document... oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't bleed out, he added the senator to the water.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the charges for Ford Kavanaugh and the letter leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have taken place in his office.
I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story, so Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes.
But his ban was not acceptable to the president, who commented on it on Saturday: \"Please tell you that was very bad at the body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst language I ever saw.
The President was still defending the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual harassment, and believed that the Democrats would use accusations for their own benefit.
They've decided to go back to power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get in control and control, Mediaite reports the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer gave Giants two goals against Dundee.
Dundee Stars applied for compensation for the loss of the Elite League game on Friday's Belfast Ginas by winning 5-3 in Dunde on Saturday.
Giants had first-stage leadership thanks to the two goals made by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to levels before Dwight returned Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard levelled Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvaldi secured victory.
This was the third Elite League kill for Adam Keefe's men who won the dundeen 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met the fourth time in the season after the three previous games by Giants.
Dwyer's opening painting came in four minutes at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul's feed. David Rutherford fed when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In a dingy opening session Sullivan brought home team back to play in time 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed the Cowni balancing paint time 15:16.
Dwyer confirmed Giants' leading position for the first break when he hit his second goal at the end of the first round.
The home team assembled its row and Bouchard again set in the power of the power ground in time 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen managed to make a first lead for Dunde at the end of the second round, and he also assured victory with the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last round.
Ginas, who has now lost four out of five last games, will be at his next home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller died in order to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board escaped an earthquake.
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller has become a hero since he died in order to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely entered the air.
More than 800 people have died, and several people have lost a powerful earthquake and caused the tsunami to hit the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Powerful posterifications test the area, and many people have been trapped in the stricken material, so please in the city.
Although his colleagues fled the store, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job at a wildly floating air traffic control tower at Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed still and made sure that the 6321 flight of Batik Air, which was currently on the runway, was safely released.
After that, he jumped out of the control tower he thought was about to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation, Yohannes Sirait, journalist of Indonesia, stated that the Agung decision could save hundreds of lives, reported in the Australian ABC News news broadcast.
A helicopter was prepared for Kalimantan Ballipapapan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter made it to Fire.
- This news breaks our hearts, he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims will grow to thousands because the country's disaster authorities have reported a lack of links with the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong.
The number of victims is believed to continue to rise, as several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been targeted, the agency informant Sutopo Purwo told.
Even the six - foot [6 m] waves have been destroyed by Please, where there will be mass graves on Sunday.
Military and freighting machinery will bring aid and equipment to the area.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambullants bring bodies all the time.
There's a shortage of clean water.
The mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indian Red Cross will rush to help the survivors, but we do not know what is waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may prove even worse.
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and said in his speech to the armed forces of the country: \"I ask you all to work day and night so that all the functions related to evacuation can be carried out.
You're ready. CNN's on the news.
Earlier this year more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia Air Niugin states that one person is missing when an airplane crashed into lagoon
In Micronesia, the representatives of an aircraft crashed in lagoon in the Pacific now report that one person is missing, although it is reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from a sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information on missing passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crews after the plane was hit by water while trying to land at Chuuk airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was stable.
The reason for this failure and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet have both reported the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had driven over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes told us the plane landed very low.
\"It's a very good thing,\" said Jaynes.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to waving on a sinking plane in a hippopotamus-free water for emergency exits.
He told the passenger staff that he had panicked and cried, and that he himself had a mild head trauma.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors in the repairs of a nearby docker had participated in rescues by transporting people to the shore by a rubber boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (per hundred feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the ruins of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the ruins.
A analyst plays a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the reprocessing in which the man was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, proved hours and hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he had used cell phone records when he gathered together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location of several mobile phones, which showed that Telin had been contrary to his previous claims with Chambers the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Telis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford proved he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked me if Tellis was telling me the truth when he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was running because my car was in Nashville.
Another incoherence was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the information stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett found that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' texts, calls and contacts from his phone.
He wiped him out of his life, Hale said.
The final speeches on defence are planned for launch on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting a trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is aware of hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to challenge the genes associated with negative perceptions by making music full of positive messages.
According to the Bristolic Society of High Breed, hip hop has been removed from the original message of political and social problems.
They want to get back to the hip hop roots and make an informed hip hop once again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have been able to prove a new rise in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark guy?
A child nurse in New York is suing the couple to court over racist text messages
The New York childcare nurse challenges the couple from discriminatory separation by accidentally receiving a text message from the mother of the child, in which she complains that she is one of the dark people.
The couple denies being racist and parallels to the challenge of writing,
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her grief when the new nanny Giselle Maurice came to work on his first working day in 2016 and was told that this was dark-sex.
“IIIIII, I'm sorry, but Plasco-Flaxman wrote his husband a text message.
But then, instead of his husband, he sent a message to Giselle Maurice two times.
After the mistake he made, Plasco-Flaxman, according to New York Post, had separated Maurice, stating that their former Afro-American nanny had been ill-manned and had been waiting for them to leave the Philippines this time.
Maurice got paid for one of his working days and was sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for divorce and wants 350 dollars per day for six months, which was initially washed to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
\"I want to show them that you can't do that,\" said the Post magazine on Friday and added: \"I know it's discrimination.
The couple has responded to the racist claims, saying that the decision to end Maurice's employment was a reasonable solution because they could not trust him when he was hurt.
My wife sent him something he wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist, Joel Plasco told me about the post interview.
But would you leave your child to the kind of person you've been unfriendly to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Really...
Plasco faced the challenge of blackmail, and I said that his wife had had had had a baby two months before and was in a very difficult situation.
Do you think we should start hunting someone in a situation like this?
It wasn't very nice of you to do that, but the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple's social media by divulging their behaviour and logic.
The new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers were afraid that the public would not identify a talkable bear.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says: “It’s hard to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's amusing now that the huge popularity of Paddington is known.
Noting that his father, who had worked as a cameraman of the BBC before his dedication to writing children's books on toy bear adventures, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60-year anniversary of his book publication seemed bitter because his father died the previous year.
She described it as a very important family member, and said her father was silently proud of the success she had achieved.
\"He was a pretty quiet man, and he's not a guy who's flattered at all,\" the daughter says.
\"But because it was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you're proud of, even though it's not really your own performance.
I think he's been doing it in a way that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always honoured her.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been thanked by the plane when he landed in the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save his life in vain.
\"They didn't matter a little, and told me the situation was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive,\" Ednan-Laperous says.
Then they called and said my daughter was gonna die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, \"I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you.
The drugs that the doctors kept his heart going gradually got out of his system.
He had died a little earlier, and now everything went away.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was about to end.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I had families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who lost her daughter, rose into an airplane among other passengers, who knew nothing about the trial she was just going through.
No one knew, she said.
I kept my head down and tears poured all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
That now he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved my daughter.
Dead women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can receive support.
Davis' son Tyler was diagnosed with depression at 13 years of age and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
“I do not want any parent to experience the feelings that I feel every day, ” he noted.
Davis, who lives in Lydney, 45, tells me that his son was a promising cook with a contagious plague.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile was illuminating the whole room.
But he quit his job before he died, because he felt... in the dark...
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's always afraid of the aftereffects.
Davis created the cards for people that there are people that can go talk to even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet. You need to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of cooperation shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was depressed or depressed or anything like that, he said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was right down on Christmas day, and when the kids opened up their gifts, he didn't take them to the stand or anything like it.
He points out that Mark’s death has been a severe trauma for them, but they still need to find out how: “It will break up the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But all we have to do is move on and go on with life.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts his investigation.
“I thought that if we could really achieve what he hoped - time and scope of border study - maybe we could achieve a little bit of unity - then Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would break down the deadlock by its supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Reconciliation is about timing.
Interim elections are only five weeks away, 6 November, and if Republicans’ success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to be the highest court in the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the senators to loot their support for Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary through him.
What happens after the FBI's report has been prepared?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, the vote will take place.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, when Vice President Mike Pence could blow across the game and confirm his election to the highest court.
The number of North Korean flags falling during Kim's period
According to the South Korean legislator, the number of people in North Korea has decreased since the seven-year-old occupation of Kim Jong-un.
Park Byeong-segug quoted the Ministry of Integration of South Korea and told us that there were errors last year in 1 127 in 2011 they occurred in 2,706.
According to Park, the crucial factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in the prices of human smugglers.
There is no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korea's parasites will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
From Seoul it is said that more than 30 000 North Koreans have come across the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most escape through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a strongly protected demilitarised zone between the Cores.
China treats parasites as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and most often return them by force.
Furthermore, technically, the relationship between North Korea and South Korea in the war has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the negotiations at the stop line on the collapse of nuclear equipment.
This followed the June historic meeting where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed, at a general level, to pursue the nuclear non-proliferation of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for being stuck in prisons after the meeting.
“There is no confidence from the United States in our national security, and under such circumstances we are certainly not unilaterally taking out our equipment first, ” Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a hystereer, and she's not fit to act in the highest court.
The minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and said that this was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
The game commented on the issue during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called ‘hysteric’, ” said Pelosi, of her reaction to the statement of witness in Kavanaugh, before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he would be sexually harassed by Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in control of his feelings and, at times, he nearly cried and lost his ability to speak when he spoke about his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee, without calling themselves \"grotesk\" and \"appointed man\", organised by the Liberals who were angry with the presidential defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The fear said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to act in the highest court because it showed him to be partial towards the Democrats.
\"I believe that he made himself inappropriate in his statements and in the way in which he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,\"
He was afraid of asking him if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if this choice was confirmed and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the highest court, but also for the court where he is working at the moment, Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the US Federal Court of Appeal.
He was afraid that he was concerned by the possible provisions of Kavanaugh concerning the reform of health care or the case of Roe v Wade because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative court.
Kavanaugh, in consultation with him, avoided questions as to whether or not he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
\"It is not an appropriate moment for a hysterical and partial person to be elected a member of the court and we would expect him to say it is wonderful,\" said Pelosi.
Women need to get through everything.
It is a legitimate talk of fire when months and years of rage are over, and he must not cry.
When we're angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual.
He continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her partner in a situation where she was angry and began to cry: “You think I am sad now because I am crying.
I'm really mad.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
The tears get the justification as a route of exonerating the rage, although they are generally misinterpreted in a fundamental sense.
One of my most interesting memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I once cried unspeakable rage and an older woman, the cold-scratch supervisor, who I had always feared, grabbed me from my neck and pulled me into the stairs.
Never let them see you cry, he said.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they're sorry.
At that time, the Congressman of the Democrats from Colorado had worked with Gary Hart on this presidential campaign.
When Hart got caught in 1987 by a boat called Monroe Business and went out of the race, he was very frustrated with the Schroeder Tuum that there was no reason why he would not try to be president himself.
It wasn't a very carefully thought-out decision, he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven of them, and there was one more to the least.
Someone called the situation ‘Luks and seven midgets.’
Since the campaign was already long, he was behind the fundraiser, and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he got two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He was told that some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 to male candidates gave him only 250.
Do they think I can get something down? He's thinking.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he had his feelings taken over - his thanks to his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult for him to collect funds for voters and for his election against the delegates, and hatred for sexism - that he could not speak.
You could've thought I was having a nervous breakdown, Mr. Schroeder would remind me of the press's reactions.
You could have thought that Kleeex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking my gravestone must be hacked into a memoir.
‘She cried.’-
How the US and China trade war can benefit Beijing
The departure to the US and China's trade war was earwrecking, and even though the battle is anything but past, the country's outrage can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts will say.
US President Donald Trump gave his first warning earlier this year by imposing import duties on China's most important export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant blocking took place this week with new customs duties affecting import resources in favour of USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion), taxing effectively half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has always responded at the same time, by imposing five to ten per cent of customs duties on US goods worth USD 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world would be getting brave for a moment.
In order to get Washington back, we should give in to our own demands, but the public of the United States would be far too humiliated by the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between countries.
\"A long political decision can be made either in Washington or in Beijing to create the conditions that will start the economic cycle in one of the countries and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than bystanders have understood so far,\" says Abigail Grace, a research assistant in Asia, at the Center for New American Secure think tank.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to return to refugees.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country after a devastating war of over seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
\"Your report is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and their daily lives and unilateral economic activities on their livelihoods.
According to the UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup’s victory in Paris
The European team has won 2018 Ryder Cup at the end of the U.S. team with 16.5 against 10,5 Le Golf National in Paris outside France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe, which has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points to win the United States.
The US star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost all the time in the tournament, and he hit his first shot in the water with the 16th hole in the par-3 track, giving the match to the Francesco Molinari.
Italy Molinari was a player in all the tours and became one of the four players who has achieved 5-0 ever since the tournament was launched in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was released in the outcome of 5&4 European team to the lowest-ranked player against the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
With results 2 and 1 for England's Ian Poulter, who could now play Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European in all times with a total of 25,5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have this victory.
It's a team, and I'm glad I was able to help you,\" said Garcia, moved after the victory of the European team.
He's moving the music to his landman, Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in an individual race on Sundays.
I feel so proud after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up to admire him, 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four fights in France and he now holds Ryder Cup career record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics about one of the best players in all time, which has won 14 big wins and will remain the second to Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fina, the U.S. team had a lot of trouble finding fairways all weekend, with a high-level game throughout the tournament.
The U.S. team captain Jim Furyk, after the failed performance, said: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We were putting pressure on the European team in the games this morning.
We did it.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, working with our American PGA and Ryder Cup Committee, and we're moving forward.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm gonna have to pick up my hat.
