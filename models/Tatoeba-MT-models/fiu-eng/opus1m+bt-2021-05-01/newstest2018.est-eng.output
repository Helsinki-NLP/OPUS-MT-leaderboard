Four members of the Kemerovo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain.
According to the postman, the police held Slava Gulevitch, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in Spain, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevitch, arrested in Spain, was arrested under a court order.
Yesterday, the court also held three suspected arrests in Estonia.
It is suspected that the so-called Kemerovo criminal community is 27-57 years of age, who mainly commit drug crimes.
In the province of Malaga in Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal association was held in Mijas.
Three men were regarded as suspected in Estonia, one of whom, according to the data collected, is the leader of the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles clearly shared in the criminal community.
The criminal community’s aim was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn a criminal income, commenting the head of the pre-crime trial, D.A.V.V.V. Verte.
“We do not preclude an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case, ” added the Prosecutor.
It is a matter of people who have previously become interested in law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been essential throughout the investigation.
“International cooperation has become standard for us, and this week’s operation shows the success of cooperation, ” commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that pre-trial investigations for almost a year and a half were preceded by detentions.
“In the first half of the area, long-term work was realised and at the same time we held suspected of crimes in Estonia and Spain, ” he said.
He added that officials of the Central Criminal Police were helpful when they were held in Spain.
For years, we have good contact and understanding of the Spanish police and civil card forces.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can get them from across Europe, ” said Leis.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that men suspected may continue to commit new crimes, and therefore the prosecution requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his assignment to Estonia.
In order to ensure confiscation in this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been seized.
Pre-criminal proceedings are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Office and led by the Public Prosecutor.
The Tallinn City Court condemned Slava Gulevitch for the repression in 2005 and punished him for five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevitch was considered to be another important man in Estonia’s criminal world after the underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch, from Kemerovo, rose in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He claimed to have taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded monthly roofing tax on businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal income and judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the eight accused persons of the so-called Dikayev criminal proceedings in the criminal proceedings in the criminal community of Dikayev, who were confiscated a criminal income of EUR 80 000, or the judgment against nine persons that in 2006 Igor Aleynikov established a criminal community aimed at illegal trafficking in secret cigarettes and the execution of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Eastern Estonia and South Estonia.
The consolidated criminal income is nearly EUR 71 500.
In these criminal matters, success has ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out operations in any country of the European Union.
The Group on Civil Rights warns against travelling to Missour
The National Association for the Advisory of Colored People (NACP) has warned black people travelling to Missour about discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The Group’s statement states: “The NACP travel note for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017 invites all African-American passengers, visitors and missionaries to be particularly careful and extremely cautious, taking into account the suspected racial events of the entire race, which have recently taken place over the state and are also mentioned here.
According to the NACP, the group was encouraged to issue travel warnings both in the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases relating to discrimination, as well as the fact that the targets of the State's regularists are in an unevenly low proportion of minorities.
\"The civil rights of people are being violated.
They are drawn to the roadside due to their skin color, beaten or killed, ” said the president of the NACP Missouri branch of President Rod Chapel on The Kansas City Star.
\"We have never received such close complaints before\"
This is the first kind of warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults on the direction of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year, in suspicious circumstances, after he got hit by the state driving through the state, and Missouri's police took him into custody without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to the recent report by the General Prosecutor of Missour, which indicates that in the state, car drivers in black will be suspended at 75% more likely than whites.
“It is meant for people to be aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri, ” Chapel said.
“Man must be ready, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state,
Based on the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which places the number of crimes similar to that of the state at 16 points across the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to sue the company for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after the adoption of the immigration laws by these states, which obliged local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using this measure as a counter reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What would everyone know about the different forms of this severe illness?
Hepatitis, i.e. inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different viruses of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may further develop into hepatic cirrhosis, i.e. hepatic corpuscence and liver cancer, are at a low risk.
The Health Service's Epidemiology Adviser Kutsar says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatitis, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowness of the skin and mucosa.
The last condition also comes from the common name of inflammation of the liver.
In children, hepatitis may occur without signs of illness.
The different types of inflammation of the liver can only be determined based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be converted into chronic hepatitis and for decades without signs of illness, meaning that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver disease.
The Kutsar of the moon brings out various hepatitis forms and describes their course more closely.
The hepatitis viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the release of the infected person to the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and the use of drugs.
Patients with chronic liver disease, infected persons, men having sex with men, narcotics, travellers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A are included in the risk group for hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination for people who travel many and who are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are essential: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before taking food.
hepatitis B viruses spread to human blood contact, injection of drugs, tattooing, cutting, use of blood-containers (haemorrhoids, laxatives), donor blood, sex with a hepatide-like person, and mother/born from hepatitis.
B The risk group for hepatitis infection includes injecting narcotics, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is recommended that people be vaccinated; in particular, persons at risk and persons with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes are vaccinated.
The other prevention measures of hepatitis B include: prevention of the use, tattoo and extension of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and syringes needles, and the use of condoms in the event of infectious sex or prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national vaccination plan and free for children.
The hepatitis C viruses spread to human blood contact, injection of drugs, tattooing, cutting, use of blood-containers, donor blood, sex with hepatitis-like person, and mother/born from hepatitis.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection involves injecting drug addicts, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, family members and carers of the sick, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, HIV infected persons and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: prevention of the use, tattooing and digestion of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and syringes needles and the use of condoms in infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that is multiplied by the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, D hepatitis is present with hepatitis B or with superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D The hepatitis viruses spread from the blood and other fluids to the foetus, the syringe needles contaminated with them, the sexual route and the rarely infected mother.
D The risk group for hepatitis B is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and those who do not respond to hepatitis B hepatitis B.
Effective prevention measures are vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person against infection with hepatitis D virus.
These hepatitis viruses are spread on the fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low-treated beef, fish and shellfish for feeding, donor blood, combined syringes and infected mothers.
Passengers may be infected in countries with severe hepatitis E.
e Prevention measures for hepatitis include hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after care for the patient.
Fruit and vegetables should be washed before consumption, to avoid eating low-treated beef, fish and seaweed, to drink only safe drinking water and to avoid drug use.
Although in the last round the competitors tried to push four times the Olympic winner off the track, 34 years old Farah found strength in the late race and won 26.49.51.
Farah did not mean long after the finish with her husband Tania and children.
This was a special moment for me.
I really miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful, said Farah to the journalists.
Farah targets the fifth title race in London, between 5,000 and 10,000 metres, with a golden double.
Everything's possible if you believe in it.
Despite the headline, Anne-Marie O'Connori’s “Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait, is an extraordinary story about the birth story of one of the works of art much deeper to the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to the cultural life of Vienna.
But more thorough history.
It would have taken off the arbitrarily piece of information, or the narrower tipstone, the narrower theme would have allowed the portraits allowed in the title to be more effective.
At present, there are two books: Gustav Klimt and his painting “Daam in gold, ” pictured the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much larger and more comprehensive history book of respected Jewish families and German occupations in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to a pulsating Vienna cultural life, and the Austrian capital itself can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago, near Ringstrasse, or how all the heads of the Central cafe turned when Climt came in.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of Europe’s richest cities and you feel more culturally like a gram.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an inoperable syphilis and the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if there was nothing to do with the development of the story.
Or perhaps even - every pair of pints will add colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of a journey to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
On the turn of the century, almost every ten inhabitants of Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open up the Czech sugar masquerade with Ferdinand Bloch and the Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet didn't pull the whole glamoury life she belonged to.
When you look at \"Dam's gold, it's hard to believe that the end of life infection was this great lady's socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife a portrait of Climtilt, the last time he was the hottest painter in Vienna.
At that time, the Klimt order paid 4,000 kroons, one quarter of the price of a house with a good location.
The fact that some portraits suspected the master's love story with a model did not drop the sugar seed.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist created by the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor- - Daam gold.
Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait, is an extraordinary story, Varrak 2016, translated in English by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the work began, Adele and Klimt had been to Ravenna in San Vitale's Basilica, and researchers believe that the glorious mosaics from the emperor Theodora were given the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele's colored mosaic.
In Vienna in 1908 and around the same time ( between 1907 and 1908), the Climt presented another golden land.
Artistic historians did not miss the similarity of two women.
What about Hitler?
“I think that I owe him my friend to make his handiwork available to the public, ” wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family to go to the museum.
Six years before the death, Climtil had completed another portrait of Adele.
In his will too (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes to the Austrian Gallery.
She passed her jewelry to her nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Climt graduated from “Austria Mona Lisa, ” Vienna’s Academy of Fine Arts had tried to get to the 17 - year - old Adolf Hitler, but failed to draw.
Although, at times, Hitler’s later anti-Semiticism was considered to be the reason that the Jewish professors did not accept him at the Academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of Austria Gallery, referred to in the Maria will, had changed significantly by 1939 - had made it important to find the pleasant works of the Nazi party from the rich Jewish collections of art in Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art property was also suited to some of Adele’s work at home, but not the Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten - year - old dispute began between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Bauers heirs.
All you have to say here is that if “Dama’s gold is seen in Vienna’s Belvedere castle, then Adele Bloch-Bauer’s gold is to go to New York Neue Gallery.
And before the trip to Vienna, read through the above book.
Even if you're going to Climt's work to see no plan, because at least my emotions rolled around after the book closed more Nazi and Jewish topics than $ 135 million for sold painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much portrait as the story of fate in the family - and a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree at the beginning of the book was greatly facilitated by the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In life, Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200 m walkway, swimming 2.16,62.
The Tipmark comes from a 17-year-old peak from a week ago when Canada's Junior Championships became 2.16.58, conveying Priit Aarkuse's Swimming Blog.
Gold was released last time, maybe in the tenth A-final.
In the final, he passed the distance in 2.15,76 and reached a good seventh spot with a new powerful top mark.
Of the Estonian record belonging to Alina Kendzior (2.15.13), Gold was separated slightly over half a second.
Gold rose to the third in every time in Estonia, and his fresh personal peak is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still 100 m, 200 m and 400 m of leisure and 200 m and 400 m of complexing.
Last week at Toronto, Canada's Junior Championships took place, and Gold made successful starts there too.
He won 200 m of free-fall silver medal time on 2.03.22.
This was the last time that it was flooded in 2008 by the Estonian distant.
This distance in Estonia has been swimming faster than Gold, only Elina Parttõka, the record woman in Estonia.
The Estonians living in Canada won a grand personal record for 100 m in a freefall and with the new Estonian season's top mark 56.66.
For example, the year older than him, Kertu Ly Alnek, has been swimming this distance for just one century faster.
Up to the top of the person, he reached the 100 m in the tour when he received an opening letter from time 1.03.69.
At half a long distance, he only reached the seventh spot when he was swimming at the final 2.17,31.
Gold is currently in charge of Estonia's season editors at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics stretching teeth
It's resting time - that means relaxation for the president of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been the president of one of the most holiday days, the critics have already stretched their teeth.
According to U.S. Today and CNN, the president's plan is to spend a 17-day holiday in a golf club called Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday started yesterday, Trump's opponents have already spoken about vacations for weeks.
They're throwing Trump off too often.
It is the president's custom to spend his weekend in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
Incidentally, Trump is not the president of his 196th term of office.
George W. Bush, for example, had been on vacation for 67 days, Barack Obama, but half as much as Trump, but only 21 days.
And then Trump's got stuff to forget fast.
Counted days after he became president, Trump said, “60 minutes, ” that there would be no time for long leave during his agent, because much needed to be done.
He also expressed his resentment about Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter: “When Obama is on vacation, golf, party and jazz concerts, the heads of the ISIS journalists will be cut off when he’s on vacation.
According to White House officials, visiting a 17-day golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
This is officially called a job leave, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other entertainment activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for the work leave.
In the West White House, the conditioning system is replaced and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
The West wing also has Ovaal's office and other president's offices.
“I don’t think anyone would like to be in the west wing in August, if there are 38 degrees and there’s no condition, ” said the White House speaker, Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the President will continue working during the holiday.
From where President Trump will spend 17 days, you'll get the idea of a video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Do not apply to the State Office if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the disadvantaged media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the papers didn't go long enough to start bothering him for everything from internal politics to political principles.
Critics, of course, upset him.
But he didn't make his critics shut up.
Because in 1783 Washington said that “the freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and by dark and quiet we may be led to sheeplike slaughters, ”
It brings me to Governor Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subjects have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts that published their opinion on the official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, he appealed to the US Civil Liberties Union of A CLU.
The Governor’s official department called the action void and the Web Committees condensed about counter-reactions in style.
“It’s just Facebook, ” said many.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the state of democracy.
His percentage of acceptance is better on the second place among the 50 governors of the State.
Hogan's not a mindless-responsive tunic.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained strictly determined by his principles.
In addition, he has been using Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his constituents, for example, for the first time after chemotherapy, with a lazy head of his own.
Thus, the governor’s page, which is a public forum with official markings, is managed by blocking people who visit taxpayers’ dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press representative Amelia Chase defended the conduct of the governor in the interview to the Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than modality.
But it's too easy to paint pictures of online roles, spammen or hate full of people.
The Post talked to a number of real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are, they're real people who communicate with their chosen leaders.
They all said that their comments were respectable, thoughty, and even not gloomy.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, pushing Hogan into Catholicism.
The lawyer from Maryland Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, did not encourage anger, but rather anger crimes.
“I politely condemned my frustration because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news, ” he wrote The Post’s news story in the commentary state.
“I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same subject, something immediately calls it collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a great deal of concern to citizens, ”
What the governor’s department called the “directed spam attack, ” others would probably call it “public support. ”
The Facebook age allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be sent out to do the same thing to collect and burn the newspapers with critical instructions and make them keep quiet.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for having bitten Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter stream.
One of the first marked judgments on this issue was taken in Virginia last week.
US District Courtlor James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the presiding wife of Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment of the Constitution when she blocked the voters from her Facebook page.
On Facebook and Twitter, the ACTU also visited Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable postal charges had similar effects to those on the Internet.
In the period from 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers were stricken by his way of ruling.
And even then, Washington had to breast-feed with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions to his country.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of the project for collecting web-based letters from George Washington, he buried his office under petitions that criticized his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements concluded with Britain.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of expression, differences and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And the right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty expects the comfort of the home territory at the Renaissance Club
The former European pre-number Ronan Rafferty looks forward to the comfort of the home territory in the next three days when 25 Scottish Senior Open takes place on the Renaissance Club of East Lothian.
The Northern Irelander, who was in charge of the last round of Archerfield Links in the neighborhood last year prior to the arrival of Paul Eales, has started the new venue and will perform the role of the ambassador instead of Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club.
“I see how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we can see how the club will shine with this event, ” Rafferty said.
“The champions see the track in their best form, it is in a glorious state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's an enthusiastic supporter of golf games, and he's proud of what's achieved here.
This will enable the track to be excellently presented –
English Eales is looking forward to the first time protecting the championship, although he has won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
“This is a very special feeling, ” said the player who nested in Southport.
“I could not protect my Extremadura Open because it was taken off my winning calendar a year later.
It's magical to come back to it.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories for me from last year were special for me and my wife Sharon last year.
It was a very special time that we will remain in the heart forever,
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour to the beginning of the year, will return to the competition again.
This is his first event in Scotland after participating in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“ Home play is always a little more meaningful, ” said Orr, a man from Helensburg.
“You want to be well present, but you also feel the extra voltage.
I've replayed a lot of fun and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things go so far.
The former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the Trio field.
The Orr and the former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottishs in the racelight, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and car parking costs a car with one passenger 5 pounds and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.
All income goes to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the land of Indonesian gold grass
When Bardina Dege prepares dinner, she won't use the stove.
He even uses pot rarely.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotal, the capital of the Panian regime in the province of Papua, Indonesia, the housewife in the local language places the Batate to be called nota directly into the firehouse.
After half an hour, the carbonised tuber is removed from the fire and washed with unwashed hands.
Degei does not have furniture on the mud floor, and in the same way he does his daily household work, such as washing the fog from the nearby swamp with water.
A bucket plays a role in a room without a roof.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the village's men to be unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are more soldiers.
“No one dares to visit the village after five o’clock in the evening, ” he says.
It is a rare sight to survive in the mountainous land of Papua. It is a former Dutch colony that was added to Indonesia in 1969 after there was no referendum, during which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote under the eyes of the occupation forces.
The movement that led to the release of Dutch sovereignty quickly towards its rage against the Government of Jakarta, which is still under its strong control, avoiding foreign journalists and human rights overseers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the east of the island.
The enarotal is also a remote and abandoned place. To reach this location, you will have to fly from the capital of the province to Nabire 90 minutes from Jayapara and then pass the five-hour journey with the rental car.
There is no common transport.
The town with some 19 000 inhabitants consists of tree houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by waved iron roofs, which have been transformed into different shades of yellow.
Very few Indonees have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor has there been almost any foreigner here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“ We were not used to wearing such clothes, ” says Degei, referring to our color - layered turbines, dark shirts, and a large skirt.
\"before that we carried only the leaves of plants on the body\"
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on the mortality and illiteracy of infants are one of the worst statistics in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's precious land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountain province of about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine in Grasberg, which belongs to a company operating in Phoenix, Freeport McMoran.
In 2015, alone, Freeport mined around $3.1 billion in gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua can be threatened with consumer wood stocks, estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the suffering of the popes, as they lead to a suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times 2005 survey showed that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military and military units about USD 20 million, including up to USD 150 000 to one officer.
The efforts of the popes to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are ungratefully transformed.
According to human rights activists, over 500 000 popes have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights, the mass killing of genocide in the high mountainous countries of Papua in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police.
The 2016 report of the Brisbane archbishop, entitled \"We are losing everything\", contains statements of cruelty committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one reports indicate that rape and electric shocks are particularly widespread) and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“The number of victims is difficult to read together because such incidents take place every week, ” says Andreas Harsono, Researcher of Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The screws have been turned down even more strongly because the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of new dwellers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the population in the province of 3.5 million are Christians, but demographics are changing, as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Indonesian population-rich islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes.
Japanese family restaurants sell gado-gado with chips and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals can't compete with them.
“Migrands started selling chicken and vegetables more cheaply on the traditional market than local popes, ” explains Abeth You, born 24 in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
‘The mother-mamas of the Papapa papua [women] will therefore lose their market share’
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokowi among the people, allowed his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former phaser won his way to Jakarta's presidential party from Papua 29 election circles 27, including Pania.
But in Papua very little has changed, and the locals feel disappointed.
“Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokowi’s expectations that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice, ” says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in October, Pania was in a low state.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing a Christmas song at Enarotti when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle from darkness.
They told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was perpetuated to their voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and observers, drunk soldiers pursued children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yememot, was so brutally beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election committee building was set on fire, and the next day things were escalating.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for justice to the football field in the local police station and the military control centre.
They carried the ceremony yachts and presented the papua mee pago tribe waita dance, during which a bird song was run and embroidered.
Some protestors started throwing rocks at the police and the military.
In the event of an outbreak of evil, soldiers were sent through the inside radio. “ When crowds show resistance more than three times, shoot them down, ” according to the official document that has been seen in the magazine TEME, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
Kayame (56) was the elder in Kego Koto, the city of Enarotal, who felt the threat and called for peace to be preserved, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
“At the turn of the turn, I was suddenly shot at the left wrist, ” he told TIME, in her bright colors, on the veranda of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from a gathering of soldiers.
“There were many people, ” he added.
The local man Alfius Youw got shot at by his cousin said he was shot three times.
“ I ran to him and studied his body to make sure it was with him, ” said TIME, a synthetic Yohanes, who uses only one name, like many Indonees.
\"I saw him dead... \"I kissed him...
The chief inspector, Yotje Mende, Papua Police, told the reporters that he would only be subject to the security of his department because it was attacked.
“We must protect ourselves when we are threatened to be killed, ” said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, spoke in 2015.
\"This is a matter of life and death,\"
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
News of the killings came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura gave a passionate speech, expressing compassion to the families of the victims and allowing them to deal with the abuse that took place in Papua.
“I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never will be repeated again in the future, ” he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he was setting up an external mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most crimes occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the early 1990s and the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes, ” he said.
On June 5, Jakarta, with the magazine, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all things will be settled by law ”
Wiranto, accused of crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1000 people in eastern Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including what happened in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania accepted such claims with a gloom of gloom.
“I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made, ” Yohanes said.
\"I'm tired,\"
He says he still lives in fear for years later.
“I’m afraid, ” he says.
“I fear that the army will arrest me, I fear I will be shot ”
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed that the people of Pania are afraid of destroying this incident.
He said he got beaten by the military after he had helped the four victims to bury him.
“After the funeral of the bodies, the army came to find me, ” he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot village residents in Deiya, a neighboring Regiment in Pania.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, as a result of the conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in fishing for the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
In front of the company's office, angry villagers protested at the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at the police that the last ones responded to the warning invoices.
But according to the locality, the mobile Brigade (Indonesia military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
“We were in a large panic, we were afraid of revenge, ” said TIME’s 29 - year - old Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw injured persons coming in.
\"I've been hiding in my house for two days,\"
The Deiyai Parliament has called for police to be held accountable for this matter and for the police to withdraw their mobile Brigade from the region.
Pania has always been a problematic place for the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of thought-out development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, many, Dan and Damal tribes living in the central mountainous highland of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) army of rebels, which, according to them, defends the rights of the popes by organising attacks and attacks on human beings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL leaders are from Pania, including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army has been arresting thousands of people in Pania on the pretext of “the defense of the sovereignty of the nation. ”
Some of them never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniad is known as a “tragical forgotten place ”
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread's the same unreachable.
People grow their whole food mainly in Batat, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Breeding is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five batate fields.
They usually keep most of the harvests for the family, and the rest sell on the local market.
Ten Batats only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between the indigenous popes and the new migrants have increased considerably since the opening of the new routes at Nabire airport.
These few jobs that exist are better suited to educated and wealthy migrants.
The popes often lack capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
“No young people are not interested in staying at the village because there are no jobs and no money here, ” says John Gobai, chairman of the Panian Council.
The separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, foreign media continue to be subject to severe restrictions.
In the early half of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out from Papua because they did not follow relevant practices, although they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Deputy Head of Human Rights Watch Asia, Phelem Kine, Jokowi's election promises have not been implemented to remove the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development.
“Indonesia, the most troubled provinces in the east of Papua and journalists trying to make reports from West Papua are threatening new threats to the rejection of the visa and the inclusion of the black list, ” he said.
The lack of a stark view of the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the neighbouring neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations in Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “a number of widespread crimes in Papua, including the shooting of the Pania.
These same countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, threw aside the charges of the group, said Jakarta to journalists: “Indonesia is still subject to democratic order and freedom of the press, so that evidence of human rights cases is difficult to bury –
Local people want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation led the State's Ambassador of Human Rights Kees Van Bar on May 4, Jayapura visited, the local people interrupted the meeting, but the source who wanted to remain anonymous stated that their silence, calling strongly: \"We want freedom\".
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the popes will not believe that they will vote again for Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved with the shooting of Pania, ” says Hobai, Chairman of the Council of Nations.
He wants to tell Jokowi that, in addition to the constant threat of a predatory army that the people of Pania are living under, they are struggling with vicious education and health services because of misery.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, as well as other popes, consider their vote on Jokowi to be a debt he must pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice, ” he says.
Despite the atrocities and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shootings in Pania were able to bury one of the victims in the country in front of the police station of the body and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be placed on the feet, they will at least not allow the defendants to forget their crimes.
“ One of our family members was killed, ” Yacobus says.
\"What else can we do?\"
The fire was swallowed by the Dubai Torchi skylighter for the second time.
On Friday, the fire was clapped through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, making hundreds of inhabitants escape from that 337-metre height and 79-storey building.
It's another fire that's been destroying a high-tech building called a case of Torchi, or Torvikuto.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We had a drink down the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, ” said Reuters, a resident who called himself George.
According to civil defence officials in Dubai, the firemen wiped out the fire around 4 a.m. at local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for the victims to secure shelter.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outside of high buildings around the world.
During the study carried out by the Torchi Management Board after the fire in 2015, it was found that the most damage was caused by fascists - decorative panels and isolation on the external surface.
The British police have said that they believe that London's Grenfell Tower isolation and fassade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, where about 80 people were killed.
See, these phones probably get sales buildings in the fall.
Spring and autumn is a sweet time for technology fans, because then telephone manufacturers release their new top models.
In the spring you came to sell Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, also in autumn you can expect new hit phones for the poets.
According to Kristjan Seema, the marketing and sales director of Tele2, this year's flagboard is characterised by innovative design, eye-breed scanner, edge-side 4K resolution and high-speed processor.
A great deal of excitement was created in the technology world by Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front page of the sales list of Estonian smartphones.
In the autumn, smart-interested people will be allowed to use even more free downloads, more durable batteries, more high-quality cameras and greater water and dust security.
He added that rumors already made and predicted four top models, which are likely to take over today’s sales tables.
These four smart phone top models will be available for the puzzles in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should already reach the puzzles in mid-September.
The rumors, however, about the new Apple model and what can be done with it, spreads a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring a significant difference next to iPhone 6s, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous one for Apple's tenth birthday.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the front panel of the whole phone, lost is the home button and the fingerprint reader is built on the screen.
Apple design director JonnyIve requires that the new iPhone model look like a smooth glass.
There's been a story about iPhone's ceramic version.
In addition to eye-iron scanners, wireless charging and even more high-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's one year of waiting for smart phones.
The pre-ordering of the brand new model Galaxy Note 8 begins on 23 August.
There's been a lot of rumors about what new Galaxy Note 8 looks like.
Word is that there is even more business for the user, and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which has a width and the other with a narrower field of vision, television objective.
Now no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, it's Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8.
But we look forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has made sales this year by three smartphones’ front door with Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented already on 16 August.
We look forward to a 5,3 inch edge-to-side screen and top beam Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
The case of Nokia also refers to the aluminium housing and the significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia has two rear cameras on its new model, which is made by Zeiss.
If Sony's secure flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones have even more innovative functions.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
For Sony's new model, it has been speculated that its screen is at least six-inch.
As a matter of fact, we can see already very soon, because traditionally Sony has released his autumn flag ship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to the phone calls leaked, Trump pushed Mexico into paying for the border wall.
The Washington Post disclosed the phone calls between the President of the United States Donald Trump and the Mexican and Australian Heads of State.
On January 27, Trump called the President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto to finish the public declaration that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of America spoke to him for a public condemnation of the wall, saying: “You must not say this to the press.
Trump set up his presidential campaign to build along the southern border wall of the United States and swore that Mexico would pay for this project.
His first talk with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbell was also published, which reveals an intense exchange of thought.
Trump told Turnbul that an agreement between the United States of America and those who are going to Australia would be “worsy, ‘worsy, ’ and ‘iron, ’ he claimed that the agreement that was made during the Obama government would leave him to be ‘ the Prime Minister’ as he proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump stopped talking by telling Turnbil that “it was the most unpleasant speech of the day...

While many complain in social media that the noise from the Weekend festival is disturbing their nighttime and the whole town is full of drunk parties, there are also many who have no bad words about the beach festival.
I'm even positively surprised that the store party was so polite!
I didn't see any confusion or rudeness.
I even saw kindness, says Laine.
“ It’s a joy to come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which has remained like wintertimes, ” she adds with joy.
The beach-reflecting tyranny Laine sleep does not interfere.
When he heard music playing at the beach while living in the city center, the music hasn't reached his home.
“But I hope to hear, ” he says joyfully.
Agnes, who spoke with the evening newspaper, also says that a big festival is more good for Pärnu - it is helping local merchants to get along well.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the capital of the summer.
A woman of party noise doesn't get in the way.
Although I'm no longer sundae on the beach, I'm glad the beach is alive.
And I am glad that the people are moving, and it's already been like that three times, ” says a woman.
I think the first time was a little worse.
“Then perhaps there were complaints, ” he meditates.
But the noise at the beach is common, according to him, for the summer birds.
“This Week is a very good promotion to our little town, ” says Harri, who is in the park.
The noise and the noise haven't hit her life line either.
What about what?
We should all stick together.
Consider how this international communication would be better.
A man of loud music won't be crushed.
It doesn't interfere, although I live near there.
“ Good people can hold together and do nothing wrong, ” he says.
Visitors who came to Pärnu say they're polite.
“A few of them have, of course, been a little overreacted with them, but young people are young and a father is a god - give us a gift, but be human and we can do it, ” he says.
By then, coastal residents have traveled away somewhere, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
“But in general, the festival has a positive impact on people who enjoy such noise, ” says Tiina, who walked with children.
Her family’s dream music does not interfere, even though last year it was even further from this year’s.
Last summer, the stage was different, then we heard more.
We live out of the city, that it actually goes back there, quite well, ” he says.
Pearson cuts to another 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalize business
On Friday, the British educational company Pearson said that it would cut down 3,000 more jobs and reduce its intermediates by 72%, thereby triggering another restructuring programme to solve the threat of business distress.
According to John Fallon, lost jobs, which are highly likely to be lost at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will be added to the loss of 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut the costs of a third cost reduction programme by a further GBP 300 million (394 million) in order to try to revitalize a business that has become fast due to the transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell its participation in the Penguin Random House to its partner company, Bertelsmann, said that their expectations regarding the year have not changed after a 1-percentage increase of GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Contortion in Kabul: The suicide attack was killed by NATO soldiers
According to officials, in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the self-help bomber attacked military Konvos, killed one NATO soldier and wounded several of you.
NATO's statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that Afghanistan has committed this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed by Herat's Mushero attack.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber near Iraq's embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that a Thursday evening explosion took place when the Joint Patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a \"human-made explosive\".
According to the statement, all injured in a stable state and treated at the U.S. military hospital in Bagram airport.
According to the Correspondants, the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) are an increasingly growing source of concern for forces in Qarabagh NATO Bagram.

According to the Correspondants, suicide attacks in Kabul have also led to a public crisis of trust against the government, its policies and, in particular, the President, Ashraf Ghana.
The EPA withdrew its decision to postpone the Sudu Regulation after the action was brought
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) withdrew the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama-time regulation, which obliges States to limit the emissions from the Suusual Gas, one day after the Agency was sued by 15 States due to its visit to the Court.
The EPA announced its decision to continue with the 2015 actions to determine the ozone content – late on Wednesday, saying that this shows the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
“We believe that we have to engage in and listen to dialogue with partners from our states, ” said Scott Pruitt, Director of the EPA.
In June, the Pruitt had announced the EPA's intention to reject the determination of ozone content in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to a more stringent air quality standard in October 2018.
15 The Democratic States, together with the Columbia District, filed an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
According to Trump, President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have created a response to democratic and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the effects of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that the inhalation of ozone-containing air may “reducing the ability of the lungs to function and increasing the risk of getting sick of respiratory diseases, such as asthma.
German pigs may have a party.
In Germany, pigs and bovines can have a party, as strong rains threaten the harvest of another wheat producer from the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, the rainfalls that have lasted for weeks before harvest may mean that the fruit for the bread industry is for animal feed only.
“This quality is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015, ” said Bernhard Chile, the Agravis Raiffeisen analyst.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat for animal feed, which is double as usual, can be predicted in Agrav.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First the winter was too dry.
Then the cold spring came, which was replaced by a hot wave in June.
In July, Germany caught the saws, which continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
Until then, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the areas have not even begun harvesting, reported local harvest collector Ceravis.
“It’s been quite a difficult day, ” said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a senior trader in Ceravese.
Consistency with everything, or the interior design of the Finns.
Beautiful nature plays its part in brass homes’ interiors because the large windows reach Saimaa cliffs’ wonderful views in many rooms (life).
On every step, the efforts of our northern neighbours to create both the rough and the perfect (energy-efficient) homes will begin.
The ability of Finns to use wood as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty equipment is worthy of beauty and beauty.
Vibrating techniques and smart solutions can be found in brass houses by both the builder and (house) designer.
There, it is evident that black, white and grey shades, if they are supplemented by wood tones and room dumps, can be very exciting.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week because it lasts until August 13th.
Appetizers and starboards suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
The night against today was brought under the line of the Week Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix on the led himself to remember the last performer.
During Garrix’s performance, the crowd had a real turn - a song, a scarf, was danced up.
When Garrix was finished, the protein was spread in a mass from the Pärnu coast to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery where there's all the pictures that our photographer's been trying for three days on Weekend.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko will meet for the first time, discussing possible opposition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in the crash course to respond to the most attractive boxing match in the near future up to 66,7 kg in weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in ESPN's office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council's lightweight champion, walked the second end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's close-weight champion.
Following the unanimous decision by Garcia, the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner, the two fighters in the showtime, will be in the preeminence of the weighted table.
Garcia handed her right hand and said: “How are you doing, champion?
I wish you luck.
Lomachenko protects his belts with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a couple of photos were posted, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that the potential opponents could be \"full measurement\".
“I’m a former featherweight, ” recalls Garcia.
“I moved up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move downwards of light weight.
And he has to move upwards light weight [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have asked for it.
Then let us offer it to them.
Lomachenko agreed.
\"The world needs this fight.\"
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to look at it. This is part of his strategy that he wants to have Lomachenko debated at the end of this year in a class of 61.2 kg to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokauts) who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match winner after their lightweight Forum on 23 September.
“Looking at this fight could be worthwhile, as fans have wanted it to be opposed, ” Garcia said later, saying that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready...
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko to be “a mighty fighter ” and could go to see his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, on the other hand, was modest at Garcia's praise, saying that he thought the three division champions from Riverside looked out “very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted to do it a little bit.
According to Garcia, the aim was to show the impact strength and then to box.
They both confirmed that they felt the tension growing to enchant between them.
“This is a battle that is waiting to be realised.
No other match will bring so much attention and sumina.
I'm more than willing to work for it, ” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I have been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is the one.
It's gonna be a good fight.
What aspects of the world will be moved to Estonia?
Over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or family were extended and issued a record by the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA).
For example, when a fixed-term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners last year, this figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
When, ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, this figure will begin near 2000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased hyplically during the Ukrainian crisis - 1087 persons were granted a fixed-term residence permit in 2014, 675 years earlier.
According to the Statistics Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing most in Estonia - last year 850 Ukrainians arrived in Estonia more than left.
“ The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already facing the family, ” says Kristin Rammus, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians authorised to live on a fixed-term basis was higher than even the number of Russian citizens, although over 10 years the total number of valid residence permits has been issued to the last.
When Ukrainians come here to work most heavily, Russian citizens are here for family migration.
“In view of the historical Russian community here, they are also most likely to have the biggest family ties with people living in Russia, ” said a migration scientist named Helina Maasing.
“When you look at where the Russian citizens who have been authorised to live in Estonia have moved, after Harjumaa, you have immediately added that about 40 percent of them have married the citizen of the European Union.
I received a temporary residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the Russians who wished to extend their residence permit decreased.
“The hype is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been requested instead of an extension of the residence permit for Estonia permanently, ” explained Rammus, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, who said that Russian citizens’ interest in the Estonian residence permit has remained more stable for years.
A new residence permit permanently for Estonia can be applied for by foreigners living here for at least three years from the previous year.
Its aim is to facilitate the adjustment of people's lives.
However, long-term residence permits require, for example, five years.
As a result of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably been reduced.
For example, last year 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now the Ukrainians can change their jobs, and the Estonian state no longer comes close to whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular - applicants last year for grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese people, were granted residence permits to live in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, a country that has been surprised to become citizens of Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for an Estonian residence permit.
When three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
They're coming from Nigeria to colleges here.
Estonia’s higher education institutions are also popular, for example, among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen greatly due to the migration of the study.
They also have the rule that where the community has come to pass, Rammus added more easily.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If in the year about 6000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit, that is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union were to be included, the migration would remain at around a percentage point, said Maasing that the figures were actually small.
According to the statistics office, 14 822 people moved to Estonia last year, and 13 792 people came out of here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
The majority of people are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who leave.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens last year was in decline to 2,000 people.
Estonians travel mainly between Finland and Estonia.

However, for Maria Tammeoru, an inextricable ideal is history - old paintings and costumes: “For hours I could dream of a museum and admire old sleeves and collars.
If you do something about the church, you study and learn about it every day.
It's discovery pleasure!
Mammu Couture's global world may look like a living stranger, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine your life is!
I have a girlfriend who's got a whole sauna full of my tomb couture dresses.
For neither is it his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and go on a red carpet every day, he wants to wear these most beautiful dresses and wears them!
You can live your own life!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everydays.
It was this thought that the plan of rolling was to bring the high fashion into the countryside in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people, to whom the fashion often does not reach.
Mammu's collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu's fashion rooms, where the Royal Defilee with 45 models filled the entire street.
Tallinn is often taken into stock, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - a bravavo cries, they stand up, they want to thank you.
A lot of the audience had to be renewed, but now they're Mammu Couture's fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be impressed!
And I like the feeling that I'm kind of on a summer tour with my manners.
Pärnu, we had a 50-metre red carpet full of beautiful dresses all year long, seemed like they never ended!
Maria does not even say that the creation must be presented to the supersale supermodel, she is happy to bring the ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they're always happy to come.
It's such a nice experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show, I've always been behind the stage to give the last piece of hopeless perfectionist stuff.
My dick wouldn't let me watch the hall slowly.
Maria is the kind of boy who doesn't just want to play the representative role, but always inside.
I've got my sewing machine in the studio. I'll do most of the collections myself.
I like the whole process you're playing with details, discovering.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of my job.
It's not limited to design, it's also about stylistics, logistics, organisation, organization - everything has to fit into one of the temperaments of a woman's day.
These hours of work are still huge in the fanatics.
I can't tell you when my work day ends, it's just a day full of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant happiness chain: I'm doing something beautiful, man gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
How many times has it been said that my dress has magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The enough bully satires that made Maria famous overnight for her talent have remained the signature of Mammu Couture until today.
Martin Mürsepp from U18 boys: the gun of the Estonian subgroup tournament was turned against us now.
I'm sorry, the fairy tale's out.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't get hold of our desk.
And when such a big difference comes into the table, there is nothing to do, ” commented Estonian U18 basketball boys 61:75 of the fall of our only NBA basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Mürssepp.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and received so much more attacks as a result.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, either, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, and we couldn't build a defense.
When they were protected, however, they could keep their hands between their hands, we could not combine.
It hit the team's legs off.
The response homework was better done.
According to the Mürssepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to take down the attack.
At the last quarter, we had zero mistakes, but the opponents already had several rapid baskets.
Attitude and tight grip, which was our weapon on a sub-group tour, now all turned against us.
Today, we had no force against their aggression.
The shopper stayed calmed down with his guardian in Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In general, the tournament will be able to say good words about the whole team, and until now there will be a uniform hit-and-run.
It's a shame you've met an aggressive opponent before.
Tass has been confident all along and played his way out today, but it seemed like he was tired - he was carrying quite a lot of weight.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen before in practice, adding a supervisor.
Horrible numbers: in the match of the ladies' basketball, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, not only did the EMi B-divsjon basketball tournament take place in Tallinn, the ladies started over in Dublin.
And Estonia's game with Poland was a field of anti-repairs.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter there was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took the foot off the gas pedal and that period remained at Week 16:16.
In both the first and the second quarter, Estonia threw 4, the third one point...
When the Estonians first caught two minutes of the first four shots, and then 25 by the game, one in three and then 21 by...
Maybe within almost half an hour, 47 shots of one were caught.
In addition, two of the four free shots came from the point 2.
There was a reasonable number of reasons for this time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had 33 per cent and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two losses; on the opening day it was necessary to acknowledge Portugal 83:56 the better.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to add stocks
Today, NATO's 1st standing mine-fighting group arrived for a weekend on scheduled port visit to Tallinn to complement ship stocks and prepare for the next exercises.
In the course of the visit, ships prepare to return to the sea and then allow crew members to leave for a few days.
After a visit NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and prepare for future search for historical explosives.
“The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training carried out by them in local waters is well reflected in our integration with the Allied forces, ” said Captain Arto Reinmaa, chief of the Marine fleet’s operation and planning department.
Since 29 June, NATO will be led by the Latvian Marine Lieutenant General Gvido Laudups, who took over from the Estonian Marine Officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elias from Seljamaa, the group leader in the ceremony in Riga.
The group's flagship is designated as the Latvian Marine Supportship in the LVNS Virsait, which also operates the group's management plan.
During this semester, Sakala, the Estonian Marine Manhunter, is also part of the international unit.
One of the four groups of vessels under NATO Marine Command are NATO's 1st permanent mine-fighting group, a stand-up unit belonging to the primary high-speed responders, which may be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become a place to be taken down 13 years ago at the Birgitta Festival, which was invited to life by the maestro Er Klas.
According to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The opera world’s classics include the “Travata – and Tosca –, the ball recordings from the snowy “Bolorus” and the fun “Karlssonini” as well as the plan’s own production, which is then set up by Joseph Haydn’s wonderful oratorium “Times ” by the same international creative team who brought the two masters of Haydn on stage in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival that's gonna take over and never let it go again.
Because the experience a listener gets in this super and mysterious environment makes human souls ringer and touches human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic leader of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't it look a little big?
Of course, since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been a lot of help.
He took me through my entire student career and supported me at the beginning of the division career.
Maybe just because of this, it makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Special Class has injected Birgitta Festival's team so much goodness and, of course, it's all transferred to me.
It was great joining a team who knew exactly how things were going.
It was the heart of different Kalas that gave me the strength to go forward forcefully with Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonia.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What can be excited about the audience at the festival this year, what are you offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise we have the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's story.
This is \"Karlsson's Flying\"
And one of the evil nuances about this ball author is Juris Karlsons, the Latvian composer, who himself expressed the desire to write it.
He's probably had Karlsson's character in his life since he was a kid.
Risto, how can you do all this?
I'm sure thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work requires support and much love, and I'm lucky to have a pile.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not as much dependent on other people as I am, perhaps, on how I am going to face every new day.
And keeping this aware tone, keeping positive and actually smiling myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my happiness.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have been working especially hard on it and it works.
A smile activates the brain and increases the tone.
It's not just a phrase.
I think people don't know anything about their own body yet, which the universe offers them, but, of course, everyone finds it gradually.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have some kind of ritual before we set up the conductor's counter?
There is, you have to change your clothes for a more comfortable one.
It's a little bit of a moment for yourself.
But generally, I don't have a chance to rest or make a little nap.
In fact, I even like to be active in communicating with people, even before entering the conductor board.
But come all the way to Birgitta Festival, here's what you can find, not for a very big opera and ballet friend!
Look at the mood video with Risto Joost!
New results of tests to assess the age of Swedish asyl applicants have been published
In Sweden, a test was carried out to assess their age with a new approach to medicine. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were older than 18, but not all of them believed in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicialverke) started the tests at the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age of asyl after criticising the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverke) for the fact that they have failed to correctly determine the age of many allegedly minor refugees.
At present, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test and a total of 2481 tests have been carried out by the Court of Justice from mid-March 2017 until 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was assessed as 18 years old or older and, in 25 cases, the Institute of Justice assessed that the testable ‘may be 18 years of age or older’.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is “less likely younger than 18 to 20 years old ”
The tests shall only be used if the age of a person is below the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Judicial Medicine, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
“We don’t see much difference compared to previous months’ statistics, the numbers are quite consistent, ” he said to The Local.
The fact that most cases were considered older than 18, does not necessarily mean that asyl applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute issued 581 test results and said that in 442 “there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older”
But when Svenska Dagbladet studied the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases had been directly claimed by man that he would receive this year 18.
This method of medical age assessment, by which X-rays of wisdom teeth and kneel joints are conducted, have subsequently been criticised by dentists and radiologists in some circles.
One of the sceptics is the Karolinska Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose tasks include assessing human biological maturity to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later.
“I have had reason to think about this, and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot be sure, we should not make the face so we can, “he told the newspaper Metro.
However, Johan Göransson, the Court of Justice Institute, defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it is possible to say that the risk of a child becoming an adult is low.
The highest risk, or around 10%, is if a person is a little less than 18-20

A 20-year-old left-winger Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut on London's MM, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female carer and a joyful woman confirmed that she would hope to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
The first attempt (64.80) immediately made my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much, and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear, said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MM's debut ended well in 18th place.
The rainfall orel was not disturbed, because he's training in the winter at the TTÜ Stadium.
“ I’m rough, ” she said with a little fellow.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house, did Orel sense people around him, or could he turn himself off?
I get it, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it's gonna give you more, that's right!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel assured me that he and MM are still in peace and that he is waiting for a lot of good competitions: “I came here this season with 32nd, or last result, I finished my 18th.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old, and I'm MM, it's the only thing that matters.
I'm taking along a good experience, and one day I want to fight for the medals.
The governor of West Virginia announced a party exchange
On Thursday evening, when he met President Trump, Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced that he would exchange parties.
“Whether it or not, the Democrats walked away from me, ” said Governor Justice.
“Today I say to you, having prayed and thought about... today, I tell you, the West Virginias, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor...
The gathering was filled with joy.
“I’m going to be a Republican tomorrow, ” added Justice.
“As a trainer, I would tell you that it is time to play another game –
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the Western Virginia gathering.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and that he actually owns a coal business from his father.
His value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that \"the exchange of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party, which would prevent the country from re-establishing rather than working for it\".
“In all 15 governors and control of the lowest number of states in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is simply the most recent rejection of the party, which is at the end of the day and is not able to find a positive and connecting message, ” said RNC's premiere Ronna McDaniel’s statement to CBS News.
Not only is there a lot of people who have been injured.

The medics have also had to assist a few more injured visitors - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made sewings when a person has broken his hand or finger.
Smaller seams we're doing here, we're sending the larger ones to the hospital.

Coe congratulated the Russians for their sincere apology for the doping scandal.
Sebastian Coe, a light - powerful international noseman named Sebastian Coe, praised “Russia’s four - day sincere apology, ” for the doping scandal, but reiterated that today is not the time to allow the country to return to sport.
Russia's light-duty nostrilman Dmitry Shulakhtin said at the IAAF Congress this evening of light-duty World Championships that his state's competition ban was correct and has a certain objective to combat doping.
He apologized to the “all the light-power strikers who have been bitten away by gold medals and silver medals at the competitions. ”
In spite of his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the entry into force of the competition ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) report found evidence of the state's supported doping in Russia.
“I think this was a very honest answer today, with a very honest presentation, ” said the President Coe of the IAAF to journalists.
“The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian alliance itself acknowledged that they had had had been quite difficult times and that they would do everything possible to reorganise the alliance –
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its own restoration criteria.
“I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the Group’s proposal that today is not the time to withdraw Russia, ” said Coe.
“We must do everything possible within the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system, “he added. ”
Nine of Russia's Light Forces, which meet the strict criteria of the IAAF, will compete in the World Championships starting in London on Friday as neutral athletes.
On Monday, IAAF Group leader Rune Andersen said that Russia did not yet meet several restoration criteria.
After a presentation by the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping checks are still insufficient and trainers who have been banned are still acting freely.
The electric car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
It also creates new winners and losers on the metal market, with little change from the fuel market to the infrastructure.
Although mining gangs like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose from the other, it does not help smaller mining companies.
Right now Glencore is serving coal and oil, but in the future, electric cars will grow in cave, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand.
This year, contributions have been made to the decisions of the UK, France and Norway on the spread of electric cars, which allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
Volvo has already announced that they are planning to quit the combustion engine and Tesla will place the cheaper Model 3 electric cars on the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance is forecast to sell more electric cars than cars used for oil for two decades.
“It changes everything in some metals, ” said the raw material analyst for Capital Economics, Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cave and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
The electric cars have about three times more copper than the usual car, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at loading stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase copper demand by around five per cent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electric car batteries means an additional demand for lithium, cavelets, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will become the growing trend of electric cars from the copper price increase and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, predicted by Jefferies Group.
According to this brokering company, other winners of electric cars are Freeport-McMoran and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of London's metal exchange has risen.
The price increase in me was 37 percent.
Copper has also increased 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose by 20 percent in London, after a price increase exceeded Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billito and Anglo America.
On the losing side, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine are required to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of the lead is batteries supplying start-ups for petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
“This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand, ” said Michael Widmer, director of the metal market in Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the form of a lead price movement, there is still no evidence of a fragmented trend.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, and it is the best metal from rising prices among the main industrial metals in London.
Investors see problems for metal still far away from the future.
“I’m not sure that the lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps the cars competitive, ” said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of the metal broker company Triland Metals.
If the lead's demand falls, it's going to happen slowly.
It could happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, tougher exhaust standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which is dependent on advanced lead-based batteries when motors are launched, will be assessed by the International Research Organisation for Lead and zinc.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can go further with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1,6 million tonnes of aluminium demand for 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the total production of aluminium in the world.
This trend is probably getting worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has risen 13 per cent this year because the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of amazing motorcycles.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter fuse steel to stand against aluminium oxide.
“Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet should be an outstanding steel response to this development.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the Oil Age can also bring suffering to the plateau.
At last, about half of this precious metal was spent on diesel-powered car catalysts, reported by the metal-refinator Johnson Matthey.
“For many raw materials with high demand, such as oil and plate, there may not be much demand in the future, ” said the Natixis raw material analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole are less important, but that their importance will change over 15 years.
Plaat manufacturers believe that there is a continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars are still being sold.
The great hope of the platinum producers over the 10-year period is developed by the hydrogen element-based cars of the Tokyo Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen-fired electricity.
However, until now, this technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
“Dises seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars, ” said Exane BNP from Paris Brunet.
In July, the German car manufacturers received a major setback because the Stuttgart court banned the use of the diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche's hometown.
How football financial rules affect the transition of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unbridled consumption of European football clubs do not prevent the entry of Neymar from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona Club of Paris-Saint Germany.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that controls the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestige Master League tournament, wait until the Paris Saint-Germain.
The UEFA financial rules for fair play (FFP) set in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the Neymar changeover was financed without huge losses.
A total of EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona (EUR 226 million) solely for buying the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar's wages are going to reach tens of millions a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to the French club.
The PSG will no doubt be able to fund such money to recruit Neymar and add to its starring rivalry, given that the team is funded by a family from the Katari energy crime.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players, but they need to balance it with the legal sources of income that enable them to come out with their football players.
FFP was set up by Michel Platin after he was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fell into large debts in search of success, would in fact engage in fraud and risk destruction if banks or owners had to give up support.
Since 2011, FFP will focus on tracking these losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea's - to buy a potential club and then make major expenses to make the team better and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
For the current three-year assessment period up to 2018 FFP, clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And even though Platin was rejected in 2015 shamed by the Presidential Office, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceffer, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
“FFP is definitely not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules, ” said Andrea Traverso, a UEFA FFP supervisor last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's overdraft clause in the form of a single full payment, it is possible for them to allocate this amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract and it is therefore possible to show the transitional fee as an amount of EUR 44,4 million for the next five years.
As regards the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with the Manchester City of Abu Dhabi, became the most severe penalty.
A fine of EUR 60 million (at this point USD 82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to restrict the team of Master League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to apply for regulatory financial institutions by raising their incomes through companies linked to the owners of the club.
The Katari company may sponsor PSG, but if the sponsorship value is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG’s support was exhausted.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service can come through the 2022 World Cup Management Committee's contributions to Qatar.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador of world championships and claim that UEFA regulators would be able to easily detect such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
People who are familiar with this situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the Neymar transition with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is ensured, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million profit over the 2015-2016 season at turnover of approximately EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club is expecting an increase of at least 30 per cent of turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, having clearly agitated from the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent the Neymar transition, claiming that PSG would violate FFP.
“This is a clear - financial doping - a case with the club and the country, ” La Liga told President Javier Tebas Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Katari.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to American sports queen, shares La Liga's attitude to finance the club.
“This is the consequence of property rights and has fully changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years, ” said Wenger on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of a fair game because the country may have other ways or other interests in order to represent such a big player to the country.

Today 50 years ago: the storm of the hurricane size in Estonia, which ripped the roofs and windows from the houses.
A hurricane called the storm of the century, which, on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage, especially to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In Northwest Estonia, during those days, the wind was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from the garden to the other side of a curved tree to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and fresh, like the end of the world.
In 2002, Linda Kurova Haapsalu, an old lady, was reminded of her interview with Estonia Nature.
Linda's husband saw her planted garden collapse.
But what do you do with the trees' hands, where do you get this storm?
The sea came under the window, and the windows were sprayed in, ” said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Haapsalus Kalda Street.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and that the roof of the railway station had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda saw, like most Haapsalus, only the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralep lay down, some completely lying down, some half.
Everyone looked very depressed, and the storm went through beautiful old trees like a cell and a pragina, like a war.
West Virumaa could not suffer very hard in August 1967 compared to West Estonia, but the damage was still great, wrote Virumaa in 2007.
Haapsalu Loss Park and Padise Park were wiped off from the ground, but the parks of our cover could also be severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 meters per second, about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the 6th morning of the Tallinn Seafield, a little girl shouted: “Mom, mother!
The chickens are in the air, and they can no longer get down, ” wrote the Official Journal of Virumaa.
During the storm, the Põll Manor building in Viljandi was destroyed in such a way that it was decided later to tear down.
The August storm did not withstand the Türi’s foot-and-mouth constructions that were later restored.
On August 12, 1967, the paper Red Star wrote that cleaning the cities and settlements from the fallen trees and their branches are progressing slowly, and that residents could take part in cleaning work.
The storm also suffered fruit crops, and the newspaper reported that “partial organizations must be encouraged and guided both by rehabilitation work and by harvests.
Orcans can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32,7 m/s.
The record of the clean wind in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured for the speed of the wind at 48 m/s.
So the strong wind speed measured there was not accurately recorded on the island of Onlydloo.
Secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer airs also mean a smaller scorch in Tallinn's bathing areas.
“If there are no weather, people are on the beach, and if there are no people, ” says the beach cleaner.
The shores of Strom, northern Italy, are screaming echoes.
They have melodic competition in low rotations of a bumpy tractor that can draw stripes off the patch.
In fact, the last seven centimetres deep through the sand, picking out the seabream and the abandoned rice: bottle caps, cigarettes and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there are beautiful weather, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people, ” says Alexander Usov, head of the beach cleaning works of the company Haabersti.
It's 6:30 p.m., and the beach has a bitter cleaning job, because at 8:00 p.m., the floor has to be human.
Usov's already on duty at 4:00.
Besides Strom, he will keep an eye on the shores of Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakar.
There's been a drop in the waste.
Years ago, it was a lot more than that.
Today, people are already able to appreciate what is done for them, says Usov, who has been on the beach for 15 years.
Before something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the major works in Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea waste, or adru, that is, prided on the shores of Estonia.
For example, at the beach of Pirita, 400 000 tonnes must be transported after the beach season.
\"This is an incredible amount,\" says Usov.
The second large category is municipal waste, or all that people leave behind.
The coastal strip of Strom, half-kilometres, has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptyed three times a week.
That's how much garbage is going to happen.
However, the colder summer worlds have meant that the garbage is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species constitute deleted items.
Mostly these are children's lives.
This time, Usov's sand has been reaching out for tens of the model cars.
These remain the owners waiting for the track along the beach.
“They usually come out more, but it’s a normal harvest, ” Usov already knows that he will soon find them again inside the sand.
The kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them again in the sand.
Disperse the waste
The representative of Haabersti’s administrative services, Erika Scheller, admits that tractor screening is disrupting locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, confuses the dreams of people living in the neighborhood.
This job is impossible on the day.
In one month, the beach has to be screened twice.
“If we do not do so, ” notes Scheller, “the district will punish us.
However, the aim is similar to Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu to obtain the Stromian beach under the international blue bar quality label.
“In comparison with Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained, ” says Schaller.
We have more sand and stones and more difficult to chew the sand.
However, there are fewer garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that the beach is talking about garbage, Martin, living near the Stromian beach, will enter the discussion circle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current narrow spots of the beach.
There's a gross picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottlers who have pulled garbage bags off the ground, Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviours to date, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage cans and put on covers for example to prevent at least birds in the process of refurbishing there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stromian coast.
It's obvious the city's gonna take care of it.
With children's fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
One way or another, one day the roller skates could only drive, ” notes Martin.
found in Stromom, coins, coins only
In the morning, the period has come to use the 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasurer, conducts a beachside with a metal detector.
He doesn't think anything precious will come up either today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough for this.
“I’ve been working on it for a year and haven’t found anything valuable so far, ” Dmitri reports.
There are some euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous pounds in Dmitri's treasure box, which later throws them in the dumpster.
It's usually coins.
“The gold, rings, and other things usually do not exist, ” says the treasure switch.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The announcement from the Bank of England is that interest rates remain on the previous level, as powerless economic growth and low inflation have softened speculation in relation to the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain in the south, as the long-term income of households has put interest rates on expectations.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted in favour of maintaining the 6:2 rates by 0.25%, and fewer members demand an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut the growth forecast after 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes will remain close to 3% in autumn.
However, the bank also indicated that the increase in rates is necessary to control inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that a higher than expected increase in loan costs may be necessary on the financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the economic mammoth package that was launched as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will close a fixed-term funding scheme that will provide low-cost financing to banks, although it said that a further €15 billion was now expected under this scheme, amounting to GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the definition, the Bank says: \"In the mid-term forecast of the MPC, GDP will remain in force in the near future, as the difficult situation of real incomes in households will continue to have an impact on consumption –
The definitions have been repeated that, in order to alleviate inflation, a little effort is needed in the financial policy and to a much greater extent than expected on the markets.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all jumps are progressive and limited.
The reduced growth projections of the Bank for this purpose and the following year are comparable to May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for 2018 growth of 1.8% remained stable.
After that news, the pound rate fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell to 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change is due to the recent growth figures that are disappointing, which have suppressed the growing hope of rising GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave few reasons to please those suffering from rising inflation and poor wage increases, saying that the situation will get a little worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a hit on income in the next few years, but a marked recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
As a result of a weak pound, the economy is also encouraged by growing demand for British production, which partially compensates for lower costs for consumers.
The decision will come one year after the rates were set at 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which resulted in a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to bring all life into line with prices and the economy.
Before the Bank’s last decision, it had felt a growing demand for increasing the rate of inflation, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in distress; in July three policymakers called for a 0.5% increase in the level of policy makers.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank's words were expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess increase compared to the 2 percent target was due to a completely weak nail.
Andrew Montlape, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: “In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to become more and more competitive, as lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to be completed, as refinancing, often with a service fee and a low rate, has become more and more popular –
The NHS is writing out to 10,000 people in conflict with the HIV medicine.
From September, patients will have access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention after a battle with the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that, during the initial three-year clinical trial, national healthcare is now estimated to make 10 000 people available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) tablets, which are administered before the interval and have shown a decrease in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in people at high risk.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Board of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite its claims that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, Managing Director of the NHS England, welcomed this exercise as a ‘new major intervention’ on Thursday, while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as ‘a turning moment’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In Oktobri there will be additional clinics before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a course of HIV medicines that is taken before the relationship to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before an interval means that there are enough medicines in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken every day or at the latest two hours before an interval.
Suitable candidates include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners are infected or treated with HIV.
The clinics identify suitable people who are willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those whose HIV-infected partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in the program at the local health clinic.
The programme pays GBP 10 million and the NHS England signed a contract to get the medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who is intended and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: “This new comprehensive intervention should complement and enhance a broad and increasingly successful fight against HIV proliferation.
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of mankind’s greatest health problems.
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: “This is a turning moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted correctly to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually managed and independent of negotiations with a partner, through a clinical trial funded by NHS, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement from a warm heart.
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “Now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is quickly postponed and that no HIV risk group member is excluded.
Now that PrEP has been obtained in a clinical trial, we are on our way to protect over 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Public Health, said: “The start of the clinical trial in PREEP is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the drag of government legs.
Evidence shows how much changes this medicine can bring to the elimination of HIV prevention work and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take us a step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that a clinical trial be taken over the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and take us a step closer to stopping HIV transmission in society.
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the exchange price difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to €1.94 compared to €7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Sweden association.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity was EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to 36,27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland the price was EUR 34,17 and the Nord Pool system price was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7 percent, respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75 per cent of last month's hours on Estonia's course and 16 per cent of Estonia's hours in Finland.
The remaining nine percent of hours between the two countries did not make the next day's transactions.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia was 99 per cent of Estonia's time and 73 per cent of hours had total transmission capacity.
According to the transactions held on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the exchange price of electricity may be around EUR 34 per megawatt-hour in August and EUR 37 per month in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity production price increased last month and the transactions took place at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living a high life - half floor and smart design icons have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spaced home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker, a passionate real estate reformer, exchanged his large Knightsbridge home in 2014 against Earls Court's apartment.
It is on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed its bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
“ Before I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface, ” Joanne said.
“I bought something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it, and I made an offer on the same day.
Since the first visit, this 93-metre apartment has passed a complete innovation pattern.
At first, it was a single bedroom and a complex apartment - to reach the bedroom - had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands, he said.
He hired Erfan Azad Notting Hill from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 3.8 m heights of ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so there was an architectural challenge to create a half floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
“Metal construction is quite complex, ” he explains.
“We had to reorganise the premises so that they could be on each other without being twisted.
This was not just about building a platform, but about using a steel structure, so that the height of both the upper and lower space was right –
This regulation enabled Erfan to create two rooms of full height in the room with a large number of dramatic elements.
Half-storey, old-fashioned copper light opens from the window of Retrouvius to the glamour living room below the view.
The golden furniture, silver details, and the retrosynthetic Serge Mouille light-style emphasizes the style of the room.
Using mirrors will play a role in adding theatricality, space and brightness.
Both ends of the short corridor are accompanied by mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with the mirror makes it look like a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a safe deposit for all Joanne's dining bags and glassware.
The living room will be accompanied by a magical opportunity to close the kitchen, if not used, creating an image of the more glamoury space.
The connoisseured kitchens are nothing new.
However, the unique fact about this kitchen is that it's the type of garage with an uplifting door.
“There was a bit of a lack of design, ” explains Erfan, a steel-proof spyed MDF door.
“This is a counterbalance, so it slides very easily if it is pushed up ”
Thanks to the smart use of the room and the storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“In the end, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives value to the real estate, ” says Erfan.
“The real estate broker enters an obsolete form of room and makes calculations based on the area of the floor.
Here they have been able to increase the floor, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“The materials are what you touch and thus help to create an emotional connection with your home, ” says Erfan.
\"You do not fall in love with the electrical cable on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring.
This shows that good design and increased area help make quite normal apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may make you want not to leave, as has happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter in Chicago's high-tech skyscraper who competes with his colleague for professional promotion.
No matter what money you earn, you forget about ethics.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I hit myself thinking that this is a similar version of the business world, even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler.
As for the film, the lower the arc household element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming more and more visible.
A life-changing experience will be the cancer of the primary character’s son’s illness.
Now we have to make a choice between working life and family life.
A son who dreams of the Architectural Department makes his father think about the great buildings in Chicago, the most important things such as faith, goodness, love... without even touching the twin tower disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, it becomes clear that the filmmakers have been guided by the goal of the audience crying, because even the most hardhearted viewer can't keep tears back when he sees the suffering of a dear cancer boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his condition seems hopelessly hopeless, his father will finally understand his work of immorality and will do a good work for the old man who is looking for work.
Now, I'm betting on myself - if the movie has a happy idea, I'm going to reward my perceptiveness after the movie's coffee, but if I'm wrong, at least one surprise can be praised by a screenplayer.
For a moment, there's a doubt that I'm gonna miss the coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes down to the hall.
But the son has been wonderfully healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I feel good about myself too - I can quite predict the end of American drama!
The film is well-structured when it comes to true honor, all the necessary elements are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure it'll bring this movie in well.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit his media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really handle it.
Then he'd be first.
Politico writes that the new head of staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information that President Trumpin reaches, including news, in the hope that it will keep the superior in a smoother water.
Here's a broken reporter from Josh Dawsey:
“When the new head of staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with high officials on his first working day, he highlighted the key problem with President Donald Trump in the White House, which he intended to solve the bad information in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information should go through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information.
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to control Trump's media use.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back for decades, and now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits have not disappeared.
“When the candidate Trump was angry about unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also fairly reflected in the relevant publications, ” said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that “the former campaign worker of the month said that the key to managing Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption is stablely included in the song of praise.
All right.
But the idea that the habits of using Trump Twitter have ever been \"controlled\" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know if Trump's sparks would have been even more quotaable without their intervention.
We're probably never gonna know about the sparks Trump didn't post.
When his assistants were able to save him a few times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently producing noemics.
Part of the problem is that people in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, try to promote exclusively their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico, reflecting the whole story, wrote about the tendency of counsellors to feed to the president information of strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
“Prays and former Trumps say Trump can react to negative press, especially the information leaks having a damaging effect, explosively, by obliging to identify their source.
That is what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the happy president a printed copy of an article on Charles C. Johnson's website, GotNews.com, which accused the deputy chief of personnel, Katie Walshi, of being the source of the White House's info sheets.
It doesn't matter if Johnson's been permanently blocked by Twitter because of the harassment, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he's been making false accusations in the past and taking them back.
Trump read the article and began asking about Walsh, under the influence of
Goldmacher added that the former Head of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of the White House Office Rob Porter has tried to establish a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching Trump.
How'd that work out?
Kelly's three months later trying to do exactly the same thing.
He may prove to be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still fighting for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from a foreign capital don't get permission to play bitter.
A lot of foreign music in the city centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the evening paper was discussed admitted to play in the Old Town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near Viru Gates who had taken as many dogs as they had.
It was clear that musicians with rascals and perfumed clothes were back-bags that could wear one of the showers.
Despite appearances, the only woman in the company played a fun rhythm on an axion while one man was juggled with three balls and invited the passers closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one of their backpacks and smoked the peace of the heart prepared a screw-up.
Their three dogs didn't let themselves be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played the instrumention with Noemi and the balls, said he'd play music on the streets for both fun and money.
The aim of the company’s performance was to collect ticket money for a ship flying to Finland on the same day evening.
As to whether they asked the city permission to kiss in the Old Town, Noem and Bob were shaking their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most people will be allowed for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for it, Bob explained.
When we got back to Viru Gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and they were driving them away.
The company moved to the Viru Center with the backpacks and dogs to get lucky.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played violin, one of whom played piano, the other Klarnet, and the third had brought an electronic piano.
“We are here to provide people with entertainment to spread music and joy, and to earn money for fuel and living, ” explained the Trio piano Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city government's permission to perform.
“I hope we don’t have it, ” he said.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go somewhere else, but we have to try, he added.
In July, Eesti Pank purchased bonds for EUR 149 million in the framework of the euro area central banks’ public reserve purchase programme, the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank shall not publish more detailed information on purchases.
In response to the inquiry of members of the Riigikogu, the President of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has explained that the Eurosystem central banks’ asset purchase plan covers three different purchasing programmes: financial sector covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABSs) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank will buy together bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest elsewhere.
The effect of the shares is that the return on low-risk assets is falling, and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, in the context of a public bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its national government bonds, and no other national bonds are purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Exchange purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the provision of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
As confirmed by Hansson, Eesti Pank usually buys European institutions bonds, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds.
Eesti Pank will purchase debt securities under the buy-in programme as of March 2015.
Elering’s bonds were also acquired in the meantime, but from June 2016 Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering’s bonds.
The Central Bank of Finland will purchase both Elering and Eesti Energy bonds on behalf of the euro area central banks from June onwards.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the “Million of Millions ”
Some of the richest homeowners of West Midlands are once again caught up in a fierce conflict with determined travelers who have failed to dig the ditch of the council to win back the field from their wools.
The travelers have parked their 20 trailers on the field as a wealthy - million - mile - long district near Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks since they were just kicked out of the country without being interrupted by a ditch that was dug up by a council to prevent their intrusion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the protection limits by pushing their vehicles out of the unhindered part of the road.
The Marugades are covered by the Solihull Council, saying that the Council is “no useless in dealing with the problem, ”
One anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after their departure, after going out of the Bentley Heathis, where they were throwing stones at them.
The Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
They came to you last night, probably even more today.
He added: “Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long-term barriers to protecting its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay the council fee if the Council is unable to stop such a thing.
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: “It’s ridiculous. At the time we saw the last of these travelers leaving, and there’s a new pitch going on.
This time, the number has grown, and even the horse is being seen in the grassland.
A representative of the Solihull Council said: “We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp site in the country nearby Streetsbrook Road, and we work with the Solihull police. We are building the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible are aware of any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling at 101.
This will help create a picture for the court when we present the case to them,
Among others, the weekly festival is visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that it has been able to bring true world top names to Estonia.
The question of why it is so important for the Estonians of the Week Festival, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the full end of the festival for three days.
But he will say that Pärnu has come to the true players in his area.
“Look at the level of artists that has been able to bring to Estonia, ” says the Minister of Culture.
What artists perform at the festival, however, most talk about the island?
I think I'm a relatively old man and I'm sure there's one of the most experienced artists in Armin van Buuren who came up last night.
Well, according to his record, all of us have at some point become self - stretched, ” he says.
He will, however, add a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, we also have our own Estonian makers: starting with the NOęP and they can be read in a whole series.
In fact, this known concentration of names is very high, ” he says.

Audit updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism involving car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer more than 350 000 vehicles to improve the software.
According to the BMW President, the company believes that there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions, referring to European cities, including the city of BMW, Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would update three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
No company described these operations as a call back.
European car manufacturers have actively advertised the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment installed to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies is also increasing, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the U.S. Chancellor Angela Merkel's Government is also accused of abuse of the signs of powerful car manufacturers and of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the Volkswagen errors, which silenced the use of so-called evaporative devices that allowed the emission gas readings to be adjusted during the test of the car to meet the regulations, but pulled back in normal driving conditions.
Several of the Volkwagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic investigation.
In Germany last month, former Head of the Audi Engine Development Department's thermodynamics Sub-unit was arrested.
The former President, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition, and can go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into the state of Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent the requirements of European emissions, thereby expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audit in the investigation may be a major blow for the VWV manufacturer to generate a disproportionate proportion of the VWWG’s profits.
Estonian schools will receive €20,000 for the flag of the European Union.
By 1 September, the Ministry of Education intends to buy the European Union flag to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres from 570 educational institutions of the European Union will be available.
The flags are designed to exhibit indoors; they must also be carried out in high-quality printing equipment indoors with tunnel fasteners, by means of the ERR news portal.
The flagvarda bridge reads: “The condition for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flag is EUR 20 000 for the Ministry of Education, which means that one ticket costs EUR 35.
The journalist's murder highlights a growing threat in Mexico
On Wednesday, Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which is sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They're told it's important to change their routines.
Two senior writers will discuss which one seems safer: either bring the children to an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the screen in the front of the room: “The enemies, the neutrals, the allies,
They ask reporters in each column names to offer no evidence, enough impressions and inner feelings.
The government or cartels are suspected of being hired by drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists of the entire list of evils who would make the recognition of chaos in Mexico dangerous.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, the vast majority of them, since President Enrique Pena Nieto's oath in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have died after attacks and threats under national protection and at least seven journalists have died in seven States during that year.
The most recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-sponsor Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist, ” wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the fascist of Riodoce building hangs a big picture of Valdez showing the average finger with a letter entitled “Justice, ” and two 30s reporters Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-stars, which have a picture of his smiled glasses face or characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. Reporters will discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoid.
Although a separate public prosecutor created in 2010 to deal with journalists cases, only two cases of judicial liability have been assumed on the data of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, the number of which goes to thousands, journalists rarely find themselves in court.
Riodoce will continue to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without killers' data and justice, Ibarra said that the meeting on security is of little use.
“It’s hard to waste time at this meeting, ” he says.
\"Until the reason is known, you distrust everyone...
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the State capital on 15 May.
He was only able to drive a few blocks before two men stopped him in the red Toyota Corola, forced to get out of the car and shot 12 times.
The armed man drove away in Valdez's car and made a crash near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left two grown-ups.
The rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, only silence is the main issue of Valdez.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the release to the United States of America in January, Sinalo has been one of the most bloody combat forces in the country, as rivals are fighting over the execution of a power crisis.
It is no matter that some people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or even more than a few, or that the cemetery is baffled with a richly decorated double-dreamed mausoleum that is larger than many living homes.
For a moment, let us forget that the time of peace refers to how valuable ports and the maritime state with drug routes to the United States leads only one cartel.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks of his work, Riodoce co-founder and President Ismail Bojorquez (60) are huge sympathies that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel competing with Guzman's sons, and a cartel at war.
This piece of book may have angered the sons of the suspected gang members bought copies of all the editions as soon as they arrived in the newspaper casino.
Another mistake was that Valdez would not be forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid in one of the newspaper activities that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Norote in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem.
The newspaper gathered over time with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of the censorship and readers in a wonderful print that they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won his Latin American reflections for the prestige of Maria Moors Caboti Prize.
In the same year, the Valdez Journalists' Defence Committee (AKK) won an international freedom prize for freedom of the press to follow Mexico's drug history wherever it leads.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
“ I want to live on, ” he said, “when he accepted the prize of the AKK.
Last October, he told the TV station Rompevinto TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You must take on the task of playing a fool with the journalistic agency.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths, or why I didn't say what was going on,
Riodoce collective longs for Valdez, a joker who was rocking like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared the embuss and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported her routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the road and always sat on the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt as to how to do their job best and stay alive.
\"They don't like to be left behind by those women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.
“These things shouldn’t have been touched, ” said Bojorquez.
Even in the best times, the result is strong self - control and self - control.
Trusting my instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay back.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that “the smell can be deceived... and that's how it happened to Javier. ”
He and others say that the Sinaloo will no longer have old rules, just as they do not apply to the toxic composition of tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or other states, which is home to the toxic composition of profitable smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
The body where Riodoce workers met for security training was suddenly no longer allowed mobile phones; a few days before it was revealed that only the spy property sold to governments was used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two of the policemen were looking in the shadow of the tree for a relief from a 40-metre heat.
The government assigned them to watch Riodoce's office, which is located in the building on a four-story floor in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered whether these policemen were part of the 50 percent of the police who had been mistrusted by the governor himself.
Several months have passed since reporters drove to mountainous areas where control is in the hands of de facto narcotics.
Riodoce's publication this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of the former boxing agent Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful to write what everyone in town knows about the restaurant is a drug dealer and a sense of authority.
Reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant is registered as a politician, who is in the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Industries (IRP), which dominated all policy levels almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several governors of the IRP have been accused of widespread dissatisfaction in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how El Chapo's son of Guzman escaped from military raids.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have looked for Valdez's column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
“ We should have known what had happened, ” said the 46 - year - old Villarreal, whose sticky design served him as a nickname El Flaco.
“Now all the channels of communication have broken down with our sources –
The Valdez office has become a storage room for tags and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the employees of the press have become something they could never expect from activists in the name of press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of labels and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the Western state of Michaeli three days after Valdez was killed.
Found dead bodies and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more and more loud across the country and criticise the expression \"SOS press\" as an organised protest to the walkways and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez will be in Washington trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after the death of Valdez, the governor of Sinaloo, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
He then asked that he be redirected away from the government's activities, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were involved in organised crime, complicity state officials and negligent society - limited -
In his last book Narco magazine, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by narcotics, but are also performed by politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime.
Last year, more than half of the attacks by journalists on police and public officials were attributed by the Media Monitoring Team Articulo 19.
“In Mexico you die because you are wanted to be silenced, ” said Ramirez.
The killers are obviously bleeding.
Nobody forgets the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias' death in Tamauli pass six years ago in the northern border.
His body was found along with a letter that was probably signed by the cartel in Los Zetas: “I am here for my reports...
Next to his decomposed head, computer keyboards and headphones were lying down.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border region of Chihuahuas after the killing of their Correspondant Miroslava Breach in March.
Others pass on as they did in El Manana de Nuevo Laredo in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Cidad Juarez spoke to the drug cartel in public with a guide “What do you want from us ” on the front cover.
Some journalists have left home countries or even countries.
It's an atrocious decision.
It's hard to find work out there, and they still have to hide the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they're being persecuted, as was probably the case with the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexican apartment in 2015 three months after he left Veracruz.
Those who remain put and continue to work must dance every day over risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that his drug business was scaring him.
“Mexico is on his way to hell and that’s why I began reporting, ” he said.
In the middle of one of the recent Fridays, when the latest number was already locked up, Riodoce's editors sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and wore a beer when they suddenly started vibrating all the phones.
In the coastal resort in Mazatlan, 19 people were killed in the firefights between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several cartels found in the region.
On the side of the same sidewalk, reporters put news on Riodoce's website using a mobile phone.
The front of the next day needed a change.
The Sirens were admiring another fire exchange in the area.
Bojorquez's standing by the police to see if they're on guard.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the founding founder of the newspaper, where his average finger can be seen throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees carried out his tracks.
“How could you even think about closing, ” said Bojorquez, “when Javier was killed the same day he asked me to send him out to the streets to report, ” he said.
Dinosaur used protection color to prevent enemies
At first sight, it looks like a shape, but it's pretty scary.
Researchers have now made public the first findings of the unsuspecting nasal size found in the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as ‘the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs’.
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with his tissues was the color of reddish brown and his past had been somewhat ‘ complex ’ in some ways.
The Current Biology published a report describing the existence as “all the better preserved armory that has ever been discovered ” and as“one of the best dinosaur inputs around the world ”
For Fossil, this is a new Nodosaur species that lived in the middle of a critical era 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good survival is an open message that describes it as “of course significant ”
According to the National Geographic magazine, this type of fossil that has been found is best preserved.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in NorthAlbert, Canada.
He caught something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to look at it more closely.
Opened fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology Museum.
The following six years were worked to dig an animal out of a piece of land from 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be brought to the public.
“When you’re a little bit out of your eyes, you can almost believe that you’re sleeping, ” said Caleb Brown, the leading author, a researcher at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature is displayed.
“It goes to the scientific school as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur expression - the dinosaur Mona Lisa –
When she studied the skin, researchers found that this vegetarian, even if covered in the tissues and recalled the walking tank, was likely to be a major threat to the meat - fed dinosaurs.
This large-scale dinosaur used red and white color to hide from predators, and applied sheltering techniques called counter-covery and also used by many today’s animals.
According to experts, this enabled the dinosaur to be better entrenched and avoided by enemies, since the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This creature of the 110 million-year-old nodosaurs family arrived for the first time in May and is now visited in the Royal Tyrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now examined the creature and named it Boreelollta markmitchell Museum's laboratory, Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the master, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the armors on the body.
They discovered resistance - the protection method spread in the animal state, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although resistance is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as Boreelopellta is much bigger than the animals living today with resistance.
This suggests that the dinosaurs were actively hunting other meat-eaters dinosaurs, that evolution preferred shadowing rather than resistance to survival.
However, the majority of animals using modern - day resistance - such as deer, sera or armadilli - are much smaller and more vulnerable as crops, indicating that nodosaur had to work hard to survive.
“The powerful hunting of dinosaurs, covered with powerful and large seasons, shows how dangerous they could have been from the dinosaurs of the critical age, ” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of warm organic compounds also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about this life, including the preserved content of this gut, to find out what the animal ate for his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell to death in the river, thereby reaching the flow of the sea, where he lay his back on the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to be far further inland than they are now.
“This nodosaur is truly significant because it is fully covered with the preserved warm skin, while it has also remained three dimensions, preserving the original form of the animal, ” said Brown.
“This results in almost the same appearance of the animal today as in the Crete age.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it - it's just enough to tear your eyes off, and it seems like he's sleeping.
The time of the Crite era was when the two huge legs of the carnivorous dinosaurs were floating on Earth.
Although all of these King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Boreelope, it was possible to hunt down the enchanted dinosaur for some of his scary predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 metres) long and six tons heavy monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology believe that Boreelollta was threatened after the death of the sea and this mummification mudas.
On March 21, 2011 Shawn Funk discovered the existence when he mined in the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in NorthAlbert, Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in a warm-muddinosaur in the world, including skin and warmth, and is complete from the con to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighing up to 3000 pounds (300 kg).
Two 20 inches [20 inches] of squirrel broke out of this shoulder.
Scientists believe that this hordes - covered vegetarian adventured through the current West Canada until the flooded river threatened its open sea.
However, the burial site at the seaside of the dinosaur helped to maintain its capacity in excellent detail.
The stoned remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skulls of this particular creature are still covered by the skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine: “This degree of durability is as rare as a lotion.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The rocks of the skin are still covered by the musculature plates on the skull of the animal.
The right front leg lies next to him, and five of the toes are stretched upwards.
I have the opportunity to read the hairs on his stables.
How one activist found the answer to the question “Who Streets ”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just the day after the trip to New York, this St. Louis resident in Airbnb sat on the bed rented on the bed, siring on the phone to Facebook.
He got into the post office of his former schoolmate.
It read: “Never before killed an 18 - year - old young man, and he is still lying on the street.
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Pidemega @TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared in his timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis' region sent a real-time sparkle to Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was murdered by a white cop in Missouris in Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street staying there for four hours.
\"It's crazy,\" Ferrell was thinking about himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone down, but later that night, he saw a re-scratch that announced this time that people were gathered in Canfield Drive.
Photographs were distributed about police birds and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and still kept a letter, “Ferguson police killed my just - unarmed son.
He looked at a stream in real time, where a cop was standing in front of a group of protestors with a dog.
In another video another police officer, he said: “I will kill all of you animals...
Ferrelli remembers him thinking: “This is unusual.
“This is not the type of murder we are used to, and what we might call typical, ”
I felt like a freak at the moment.
I was angry and I cried...
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, he went after his father's six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive the next morning to Ferguson alone.
What took place with Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary “Wose Streets of which streets? ”
This is the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and stamina for the people living in this community and fulfilling the answers in demand for the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who had a flower dress on their back and had a suitable crown on their head - Ferguson, talked again about the subject they had been talking about several times before that morning - about the experiences and living conditions of black people.
“Do you remember how I taught you how to fight for your rights, ” he recalls, asking himself.
\"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it's not right,\"
“I couldn’t take her along, ” said Ferrell later.
“What is happening now is... a cult of the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle.
He needs to learn about activation and organization, and at the same time he also knows the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to get rid of and free of ourselves.
Even if I succeed in raising her so that she doesn't experience her self-righteous racism, she doesn't differ from another black girl.
I feel like I'd give her a hard time to protect her from this world.
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the way to South Florissant - the police station across the road, which had become a certain kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was never finally charged.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter connected their strength to the local business owner who made the luncheon.
They put together food bags and helped them share them with protesters.
For Ferrelli, slowly began to take shape with a new type of activism.
“My activity changed completely after August 9, ” he said, adding that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was President of the Association of Sisters of Minorities and focused on food law and health inequalities in black-like communities.
“I had no organisational experience.
It all just went down.
Several weeks later Ferrell met with one of the co-directors of the film, Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
The question came to the heart of Ferrelli: “Do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be used?
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in the recent interview: “We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard, and we wanted to do otherwise.
Folayan had already put his hands on co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the region who was known for activistism in connection with the sentenced prisoners.
His involvement turned the project into a bond for Ferrelli and six other locals, who were watched by a team on Hose Street after Brown was shot for years.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or us, but we speak for ourselves, ” Davis said.
For me, it was important to imagine how these people would be represented, as I was also pictured.
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli’s experience, he could show that the movement was not “the savior’s guide, ” but the community’s assembly, as Folayan said, he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, “What Streets ” documents a surprisingly personal aspect of Ferrelli’s life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
“I felt as if I were naked, ” said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linen.
“But I realized that the humanisation of this work and black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability, ”
Moreover, the Ferrelli story highlights and refocuss the role of a black gay woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators who thought about social media in 2012 after the murder of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, the topic reference #BlackLivesMatter, is homosexual.
“The black homosexual women in the leading role have kept moving in general, ” Ferrell said, “and that is precisely because we have to fight on many fronts.
Black homosexual women must carry all this burden,
Folayan agreed, stating that “the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women, ”
He claims, however, that “there is no such thing as creating an equal opportunities – Ferrelli was not chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
“ He was a man who was airing out the right energy, ” he said.
“But it is not a coincidence that it was located directly on the front line, as a black, homosexual woman living at these nodes is much at stake.
His energy can be realized through the screen.
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long been missing, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The penalty imposed on Ferrelli for road blockage during a demonstration lasts for 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the area he calls home, simply “a wasteful bub. ”
However, he still considers the mantra to be important, which he has been feeding on the memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson all three years ago.
“Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We don't have to lose anything except our chains.
7 quid to get over from the North after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest boys in the world find themselves at a sunbath party because of the trouble they're in, that's what helps.
Or based on what they say: “Always hang on, stay drunk, ”
But it's just an inevitable delay and a proper health run.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow’s Weekend trall or other party, and get over the North as painlessly as possible?
Drink the water.
Alcohol under and after, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even alcohol instead.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids when you drink alcohol, you have to get it back somehow.
With water, minerals are also excluded from the body and good drinking mineral water is good.
Since the stomach is often irritable after a snoring, it is especially good if it is free of bubble or is simply slightly glazed.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't cost you a hangover to break trees at Grandma's house - that could be a fatal false decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Landing in tents and sleeping out of the bottom is a more time-consuming way of planning.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you've even gotten sick of drinking from last night, I'm sure it's not worth trying to load a big fat steak in the stomach.
Start with fresh juice, for example, containing fruit sugars quietly in your body.
If you're already suffering from the health of the south, you could try a broth, for example.
And a little later on, a little later on.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from any water.
As already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and lose performance.
This way, you'll ruin your liver even more, and there will be even worse than that in the future.
In addition, painkiller does not last very long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach - it'll irritate your sore stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It's about the same thing as walking, but walking around doesn't get orgasm.
Avoid the too active rate and turnips - during the hangar, the physical effort should be moderate.
You've got to be kidding me.
Make a stupid conversation with your friends and friends, make a stupid fool of you, and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others.
A joke and a laugh may not make the hangover, but it will certainly be more fun to endure with them.
One time, the hangover anyway!
Professor Northwester and employee at Oxford University are wanted as suspects in the murder
According to the police, the professor of Northwestern University and the employee of Oxford University are being sought in a state-of-the-art search, who have become suspects after finding a dead body in one of Chicago's luxury homes with deadly stab wounds.
According to the case-laws of Cook County, on Monday, the arrest orders for arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued without bail for the arrest of first-rate murder due to their alleged relationship with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Durantleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to the warning, the Chicago Police Department issued to the community, the body was discovered on July 27th.
The cops got a phone call and found the Grand Plaza apartmentr when they arrived for a victim whose body had multiple stabbings.
According to the officials, the Cornell-Durantleau scene was recognised as dead, and the investigators refer to the stabbing as a murder, while the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as co-professor of microbiology and immunology since 2007 at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president of the University of Public Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been temporarily withdrawn from work and is prohibited from entering the cities of Northwestern University.
“This is now the case of a criminal investigation by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is working with investigators, ” Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior member of the Financial Department of Oxford University.
The university and the College of Somerville said in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help US investigating authorities in every way possible.
In addition, the statement stated that Mr Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself out.
Anthony Guglimel, head of the Chicago Police Department, strongly advises the suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
“The police have a clue where they are present, but we are increasingly engaged in defining the exact location, ” said Guglimelim.
According to Gugligees, suspects are being sought by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielgis said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a magical sight.
According to Guglimas, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm the presence of Lathem and Warren in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship, ” added Guglielelel.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to the public: “There are currently events in the field of chronology and victim backgrounds and researches different motives, including the possibility that this was a family assignment.
Idu companies that help your company avoid becoming next Uber
Amy said she wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her e-commerce start-up company, but the polls were useless.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“This system was simply not consistent and objective, ” said Erdet, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he invited outside persons to help.
There are startling start-ups dealing with new types of human resources that help businesses find out what their employees are feeling.
In the development and licensing of software designed to measure the involvement of workers, they allow businesses to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer anonymity and a hot line of complaints to employees and, in some cases, allow language carriers to go past C-level managers and turn directly to the Governing Board.
“Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but with Fitz for your company, Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO Redwood City in the start-up company of Glint, whose software companies use analysts to measure employee involvement.
According to the report, he has received a much better insight into what his employees think and feel within three years of using Glint.
In addition to the sudden surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a corporate thermal map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they need to keep in touch with their working culture, so that they do not become the next Uber that has been involved in scandalous scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described the atrocious environment in which they were punished for those who dared to speak.
For start-ups like Glint, there is a useful business opportunity to have an overview.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than USD 118.7 billion according to the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments by 2020.
Denver, a starter company in Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed this year in the context of the suspicious reputation of Uber, an increase in interest and activity.
Convertcent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glintki, Convertcent lets companies send customized pulse surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and look at thermal maps in problematic areas.
It also offers an anonymous message communication line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And if the CEO is involved, the complaints will go directly to the board.
“The opinion has been inspired by the regulatory authorities, ” said the founder of Convertcent and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or to behave abnormally, it may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, workers' leave and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations, has used Convertcent for more than a year to ensure employees' awareness of rules and activities and offer an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or e-mail address of the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a painful and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday General Adviser James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convertcent, there are potential problems, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which were not previously reached by managers who acted in offices in other cities or states, to identify and deal with them more quickly.
“I have access to a more holistic 360-kat experience of employees, ” said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group Ruby Tuesday.
\"And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with employees\"
Quinlan said that companies started taking ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after Arthur Andersen of the audit firm collapsed due to ethical violations in relation to Enron's scandal.
But only when “social media matured ” did companies realize that they could not prevent their black laundry from washing publicly online.
“ Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy, ” he said.
Both Glint and Convertcent offer their software as a service, taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to approve venture capital investors who have been supporting both start-ups.
In February, the Convertcent financed 10 million dollars of companies such as Sawphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital raised to a value of 47 million dollars.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the total company funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise if account is taken of the relationship between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More research shows that modern workers expect more than before from their jobs.
In competitive markets such as Silkon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are simply the contributions on the table.
Workers want to know that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being heard and that the work they do is satisfied, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company, ” said Nina McQueen, who is the vice president of the general benefit and employee experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Convertcent and Glint.
Investors earn income if companies belonging to their portfolio do well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow the commitment and involvement of employees to be increased, it is no wonder that they are supported.
The inclusion of data on employee involvement is, according to experts in the working culture, important.
But these data are useless if the company supervisors don't do anything to them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that there will be changes ahead.
And if changes do not occur quickly or at all enough, it may lead to disappointment and reduced employee involvement.
“If you ask 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations, ” said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how businesses make a mistake by building on too much data collection.
“For when things are not finished, the workers are thinking: ‘ Did you actually hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?
According to the report, Madison Reed, who has been conducting six studies among workers now, has been able to implement the measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees disappointed in decision-making speed and quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on the workforce and hopes that in the long term it will lead to longer-term commitment to the industry, which is well-known for the flow of its workforce.
“If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people, ” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose your clients, you lose your businesses.
The bright star of the euro area is Baltic: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic states, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
There is low debt burden behind success, fast improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
“The Baltic countries with Slovakia are a small number of euro area countries where real GDP per person has significantly approached the EU average, ” the central bank reported.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total output of the economy per capita is equal to the richest Western Europe, in 2015, the total production of the Baltic economies per capita represented only 2/3 15 of the average of the countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to a better salary abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was considered a little less than half of the surveyed economies in its countries.
NCAA’s decision to cancel twice daily trainings will make Bruins days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when UCLA football students stop to talk at the edge of a new training course in the campus of the team.
Some of them have peeled off their shirt, revealing their training camp's first day's effort to sweat off.
For a large part of the team, these powers are offered by midday break.
During summer courses, players head back to work after three hours of training for final exams at the joint stage before returning for next morning at 6:30 p.m. to the Wasserman Football Centre.
“ The next three days are a real trial for them, ” said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the player's effort to reduce twice a day is actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are received on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA had scheduled three first trainings to begin at 19.15 to match the players' already close schedule.
The transition from two trainings a day means more than one exercise a day - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season and for the first time during Mora's six Westwood seasons during summer courses.
They have until 20 August planned 18 trainings before the formal preparations for the opening game in September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA change, although it adds another item on the agenda to the close schedule of players.
“They have enormous burdens on three or four days, and this is a serious challenge, ” said Mora.
“And they will break through this trial; they will try, they are fine youths.
I believe that when it comes to Saturday and we have more time, it will be truly nice –
Once the camp is finished, UCLA will turn the trainings closed, which is not an easy task, given a clear view of the parking lot close to their squares and the adjacent center of Luskin, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by football with a network of defenses around the gate mail.
From this weekend, the Bruins are occupied by hotel players, but Mora admitted that problems can arise with free rooms during the season.
\"We're building security,\" said Mora.
“This is a real concern and it is not overstated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout there.
If you have a record of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with that.
But we'll use a security team in the parking lot and 8th.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm trying not to worry about it very much.
We have a plan in place.
The Savisaare-Ivanova Election Association, Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE, born in the Central Party, is forced to show at least as much as the political parties are involved in the local elections this year.
The chicks are, however, considered in the autumn, and the key question is whether they will all receive sufficiently disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisar?
If the support group of Edgar Savisaare has become small, events organised in the name of his election union may be unknown.
A member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central political parties and many unknown faces - will such be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some of Savisaare’s true followers and friends in Tallinn avoid applying for office in Tallinn be sought to become a reality?
The music video filmed on the city government roof on Russian poplaulu, in which the elder of Lasnamäe district is involved; and in any way, the original computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, the main character, must try to avoid the holidays and squirrels that hit the road while driving the wheel - is that how the Central Society will first try the votes of the 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to join the election boxes?
We look forward to the vision of other political parties of the youthful election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers face a black square from the beginning of August, there will be two choices: to accept that they will see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels in English or to give up tens of each month to some television operators.
There are probably also those who, at first, enjoy free television experience in the public, but at the end of the day, even if reluctantly, pay for television images and advertising.
There are unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you do not want to share in noise, instead of hurting your head at home, it is worth going to discover your country - and leaving the place for the festival guests to sleep.
Washington changes the rules of the green card
The media release is quoted by President Donald Trump, who said that there is a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules on the acquisition of temporary forms of work and restrictions on family orientation for visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money, as it changes the way in which US citizens receive green cards.
The law reduces chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have financial resources to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy,\" said Trump, according to the US media publications.
The Siberian Seto youths move to the city, the retired return to the country.
Anatol Jevseev continues the tradition of gold miners in the once - known Seto of the River of Mana.
He works 140 kilometers from home as a driver at the gold art store on the side of the Earth’s supplement.
It is a hard job: two months in a row without holidays for 12 hours work and then only 10 days at home and again.
In the three years worked at the Artelli, Anatoli has only seen the gold once.
“There is a hard time, ” says Anatoli, “when you go in, you will be thoroughly checked not to bring wine, and when you go out to take the gold with you, ” says Anatol.
Mare Piho talking to the local Seto Jaan in Haida village, who has told her much about the memories of her family in Siberia.
Siberian Setode still maintained archaic culture will also affect home-setos, as it is simply so amazing, thinks the farthest possible sets of researched by Piho Mare.
His first trip to Siberia will pass 30 years this year.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How much did the set travel to Siberia in the late 19th century and the early 20th century to get the land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I've calculated this according to Siberian Seto's men's stories, who have thought about it themselves.
It's hard to say, because at that time, up to 30 people in one group could come, but they only gave the passport to the man.
Pass was given only one but had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was many times bigger than the historical Setomaa.
It was necessary to train, to manage, in some way.
Setods came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they came into areas that were not only linked to agriculture but also to the river (wilding), the gold mines, the industry.
For example, in New Bethris, many sets later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (the Soviet power plant was built by the Uranium – J. P.), when it was formed.
Did the sets then form a majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, long tradition continued to marry one another and multiple childhood.
Seven or eight children in a family were common.
How much of the Siberian Seto culture differed and differs from that of the Motherland Seto?
They are different, although what was brought here was never the same.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did so themselves, but they always did the difference that was brought and that was done here.
Climate change strongly affected Setto’s traditional clothing because it's colder here.
Food changed.
For example, meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian Settos and what life is lived there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
Communication with the motherland was spiritually strong, considered very important.
It seems to me that now Setumaa's going to give back there, starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida to visit Seto’s kingdom day at the beginning of July and lived four days in the homes - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
“It’s very easy to come and go, ” says Tapa’s Operaist Reigo Tamm, “because the city has a great location: a railway stop and a road crossing point.
The city is no longer merely a militarized bird, we have many nature, sports and culture sites, and the pizzas are on every corner.
Kill is a top-notch city!
There is a small island that runs through the city, along the White River, where the killers tend to have a hunting party.
“This beautiful place doesn’t look like a train window, ” says Reigo.
Anyone who does not fear cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, and I can do it!
In the river’s waters, you can hold a picnic and simply make romance - you can look at the river’s flow and think about life ahead and back.
I've been out there walking with my girlfriends.
Tamm, from the opera, has been on three bridges on the river bank, practicing his oars, saying: “This place is at the edge of the city, no one may come up against you, if you have told your stories about the sound.
“There is an amazing view of Tapa, but there are also places where you can run, ski on winters, and now play discgolfi - golf course is done, the chains can be rented from the sports centre, ” Reigo leads.
I mean, old pros go in there with my disks, of course, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
Mr Rasmus Kull must be invited to visit Tapa because he is an experienced discolf player and has chains there.
He's gonna borrow me!
Reigo and Männnikägi were inseparable from the current operasolist childhood.
At least during the ski hours.
There are many tears, disappointments, and you will win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken cans and skis.
“The entire central city is now full of construction works, and all this becomes unknown, ” Reigo says.
The kill of an old and tired blind house, however, is a very attractive place to play summer discoveries.
I am pleased that in 2012, R.A.A.M. Head of Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to make a summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year’s theatre season with Aleksei Karenin was just over, on August 11, the railway station ‘Ellumination ’ is in the old flat in the 1980 ’ s.
“Until August 11-13, the City of Tapa has its own day in which, after having awakened its open house and there are a series of cultural events, including folk rally, it is Reigo, who recommends visiting the city from 91 years old just in those days.
In a small yellow cabin on 1 May, the museum has been in 1994.
“The house is small, but the exponates are very much and the information is huge, ” acknowledges Reigo’s place, which is full of the history of the City of Tape, most of which focuses on rail and war.
Reigo will remember that if Tapal passes all the recommended places, his stomach will be empty, but luckily there will be a small town of cafes full of them.
“We have such good meals and sometimes feel like you’re abroad, ” he describes.
The soldiers who came to Tape spend a lot of time in pubs-coffees, which is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but there is such an international society together.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from French or Americans.
Soldiers, yeah, we've got a lot going on!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
The TV channel bTV quoted the Foreign Ministry, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
In the morning of August 1st, the police arrested a group of illegally tented people on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but there's an investigation now.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing a terrible burden on all those who are caught by resting at a place that is not intended for that purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Dogs teach wolves to break sheep.
After the year, the giant farmers will have to take another break from the wolves to their herds, to provide “training material, ” probably the wolves who taught the cubs have already broken a number of sheep.
This year wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
I only had three of them, 124 years earlier.
The environmental agency's data are also in sync with fractures that last year the Hiiumaal wolf stock was not born and the information from the Hiiumaaa Hunting Council that this year there are two wolf farms fixed on the island.
The wolves broke 15 sheep in the Kabuna village of Emmaste on Monday and injured 18 of the surviving sheep.
In the early Wednesday morning, the wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of Reheselja village and seriously injured another who had to be killed in distress.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Development sent to the coordination circle a draft amending Act on the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the law will abandon the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified crops and for operators, which will continue to be used in the plant health register.
In addition, GM's crop operator's obligation to have prior agreement with the pre-arranged beekeeper is amended.
Although we do not currently grow genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the co-existence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least as long as it has not decided to declare Estonia free of GMOs, ” said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Rural Development.
\"The measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and administrative burdens for the private and public sectors,\" added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data collection and treatment training of GM crops in GMOs, establishes requirements for the management of GM crops and for the introduction of economic activities.
In particular with regard to beekeeping, GM grower’s obligation to inform beekeepers of the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine this in the draft information system and, if they so wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Development.
The proposed changes will in particular affect persons, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency in the field of plant production.
Only one GM crop in the European Union, including Estonia, is allowed to grow - maize MON 810.
However, until now no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reason is that there is no maize pest in Estonia, the European ranger, for which maize MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line are also grown in the southern regions, and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Development has commissioned studies to detect possible GM organisms in the seeds of various summer rapes, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded from the above that there is no conscious increase in genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that accidental contamination has not occurred.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of ‘genius’
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has been recruited by Nemanja Matic in the form of “genius, ” after the middle player against Sampdoria on Wednesday night by his debut.
40 million pounds from Chelsea in the UK last season game in Dublin, the player who bought over Chelsea started to fight against Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday in 2-1 victory in the early round, with the impression that Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the strike.
However, while leaving the Blues season-long Asian tour, Maticul was badly out of a needy match form, and only lasted 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be improved for a certain time before the Premier League started.
“He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant way of thinking - he has the mind of football, ” Mourinho said.
\"We will help him to achieve the form as soon as possible,\"
Like Matic, the Aviva Stadium, in its initial division, the other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began to quietly set up their original men by the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still want to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done a \"great job\" by concluding contracts with three of his four priority choices.
“I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four, ” he added.
“I’m even happier when they can make four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me ”
Another sow-boy got on to his leg on GSM transmitter on August 1st and this time in Muhus.
According to Matti Martinson, a bird observer who lives in the wilderness, the first court boy was found in the desert with the transmitter, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the large collection of nights in the Mullutu-Surlah.
This is because there is no crop field in the Svarri, the Saarte Voice writes.
On that Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the throats, and the emissary received another tuskpod and this one on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
One of the currants was equipped with a friend of mine named Matti GSM transmitter in Sõrves Tyrjul.
“He’s doing everything on the Internet: how he went to winter in Spain, coming back for a while at the border between Germany and Poland, and then he came to the island, ” said Martinson.
The British inventor had to install a microchip in his body to get into the house and car with a handshake.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could just open his front door with a handshake, get into the office and even run the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who wanted to make it easier with their own technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson of the Royal Hospital of Hampshire, which is located in winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
Technology is similar to that of a microchip installed on cats and dogs and only takes 30 seconds for the procedure.
Northam's company also replaces the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip by asking for one lock at 300 pounds.
This married father of a child has now installed technology in both home and his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit went to the taxpayers to pay thousands of dollars.
According to the military documents published by TIME, the White House's decision to fly the Navy helicopter last month for an American production event to be paid almost $24,000 to the South Court taxpayers.
The green and white color Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One on board the President, was the central attraction of the event of American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House renewed industrial products on their tour from all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited in conjunction with the yachts from Maine, the fire-fighter from Wisconsin, and the armour support made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the presence of the White House military office in the helicopter was requested by the partial command of the helicopter (FARGO) almost 36 hours before the helicopter was landed on the southern courtyard for the purpose of the accident.
“I knew that you would be aware of this because it is an unusually significant event, ” said the commander of HMX-1 day before the event in his e-mail to his superior, Deputy Navy chief officer in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive on the southern yard on 17 July at around 7 a.m., and remain there until the evening between 18 and 21 p.m.
The addition was that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, another Egyptian is required due to the restrictions on working time.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the Eskadri security team remained near the aircraft for the entire period of time on the ground.
The documents provided by TIME could not indicate whether another Ekipaži eventually needed or not.
Hatchi's law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
“ We asked if it would break Hatchi’s law, and we were told that it would not be broken, ” wrote Commander.
“It seems you have no choice, ” replied the Deputy Chief Officer.
The White House declared the event, an official event in America, and the Hatchi Act would not have covered it.
But even on official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform that had been discussed in the Senate at that time and praised the government's efforts to keep its regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as purely photo scenes is unusual.
Trump took note of the fact that his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, was in the background of a president's plane, and he's Twitter account is choking on messages that complain about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the presentation, “In America, ” which represented products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers, said the White House Press Representative, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often try to get the US President of the White House of the United States off the centimeters around Washington and on the southern yard.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 White House organized 58 sample landings.
According to the Agency, the flight was considered to be part of the flight crew’s standard of the month in which the flight was made in America.
In addition to that day, Eskadri helicopters flew for additional 11 hours of non-presidual support missions.
According to White House, none of the other exhibitors of this event loaded the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organising the exhibition on the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep the President's budget documents and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
However, according to the annual prices of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the compensation rate for VH-3D is USD 24 380 per hour of flight.
The Eskadri documentation indicated the length of the flight from its base to the Navy Quantico airport in both directions for 30 minutes from Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of helicopter use is very much below this amount.
“The calculation of paying costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading, ” said Walters.
‘These estimated compensation rates include staff, care and many other irrevocable costs to be taken into account for annual appropriations:
According to the 2015 RAND survey, the Ministry of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, although they cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Sean Spiker, former spokesperson of the White House, was protecting helicopter use at the time of the event.
“The point is to show things made in America this week, ” Spicer said.
“And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that hundreds are expected to exist, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I think, just like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been working on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight –
It's not clear if Trump was in contact with or not with a helicopter in the southern courtyard, but he was sitting behind the fire engine wheel.
In the White House Trump turned to Sikorsky representatives, throwing fun at media publications about company products in his personal aircraft park.
“I know Sikorsky very well, ” said the President, “I have three products.
Grit Šadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In the 2011 MM Daegus hit Shadeiko in the last area, 800 m ran into the pedestrian ramp and the pi was taken off the stadium with a canderam.
Immediately before he had received a remote jump to zero on the universe held in China.
The EM in Helsinki in 2012 violated the low-cost injury, but he received 6013 points in London at 23rd place.
However, there has been an error.
After the opening day, the Moscow MM in 2013, the Estonian record's chart has been the distance jump of the thumb.
Two years later, he received the 15th position at the Beijing MM and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but more than that he wanted to disappoint the athlete.
Šadeiko only passed through the heavyest kadapus only last year, when the Amsterdam EM was not able to get the distance from the result of the letter.
I'd just like to put together one decent multi-competition once.
Once upon a time, Šadeiko held.
The worst was still ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was severed by the first push.
The time has come to take off - do you want to continue with the seven contests?
Is all this effort worth two days?
She thought for a long time, but she found peace.
I've got my head to think clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and Rio Olympia were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think about it clean.
“I knew I wasn’t putting the pill in the bag yet, ” says Šadeiko about my self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the page clean and go on again.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the subject, but she realized that, above all, the athlete had to find out for himself.
He was so buried down by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
“ Gerti said, “He does not give up, and he wants to prove to himself what he is worth, ” says Mägi.
Now there's some peace in him.
He'll do it for his own good.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set up the new Estonian record at the Götzise multi-race 6280 points.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal peak by almost a meter (13.89) and ran the barrier to record time.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it wasn't even the ceiling of abilities, but the erased became just the first sign of competition.
He has been guided by Mägi for years, saying that Šadeiko is a master student.
He's a sportsman. He's good to train.
If something's wrong or it's wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his own body and trusts his feelings.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Šadeiko.
“I’m not the one who does the maximum in practice, ” he says, “it’s the most important thing to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Close baby happiness makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the close.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents and the multi-competitor has received support from new weather citizens.
“It’s been interesting, ” says Šadeiko.
One alcohol the drinking of which is equal to \"treening\" in the brain
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes - wine can train his brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His words are not about alcohol, or about how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the “very active ” wine-flavouring process.
When we smell the glass, swirling the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sense the aftertaste, we put our brains on to make it taste like wine.
According to Sheperdi, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste is created by the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He makes a comparison of the color of the brain.
“The taste is not in the wine, ” says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the making of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, insists that wine is not to drink full of wine.
“ There must be more to work, ” he says.
If you take too much of a sip, the system will be overexploited.
Excessive drinking of wine may harm the brain instead of its benefits - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental ability are at risk.

According to the United Nations, the role of women in the democracy of Afghans in politics depends on the role of women in democracy.
On Wednesday, the Head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for Vice-President, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“It is not possible to overreact the importance of women, ” he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
Taliban has threatened its side of the electoral process, which coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes acceptable.
This year's elections will mark the first time that power will be granted peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, women’s strong role increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent election committee in Afghanistan, 1.2 million women registered with 3.6 million voters are reported.
The joy of sharing makes every thing worse for both large and small.

From the Philippines to the heart of a wide world, or the Oil Home
Oil-bleached bags are summer classics, which in recent years have become a separate hit product, which must be hung at the top of the hand by one of the right souvenirs and which, despite its modest origin, the merchants have been able to climb up to the carbon price label.
A bag of oil - covered bags is probably one of those things that have existed in every once in a lifetime and which have not caused any special emotions.
It's just there, and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real race, and fashion fans have switched their fancy design bags to summer months instead of the simple bags of straw.
This is not just a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and braver women even walk into the office with it.
However, it is worth making it clear before whether such a summer figure is still sitting on the boss, or wet, and the laptop is still a little more formal than the sumathan.
But lack of communication has made women's true summer love.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to see is that the fashioners, on the trip to the local market as the first thing they do on holiday, buy themselves a hanger bag to which the rest of the rest of the holiday is true and which comes along with the beach, the market and the friends in the city.
Some blogists are so generous that they buy a bigger pile of bags from the market and sell or sell them to their loyal readers.
In doing so, it is worth noting that there is demand among the readers for women (and men!) in the real world to come after each other to become a happy owner of some bags.
In some sense, it is also understandable, because few are the procedures when some of the things that have come up in the fashion world can be bought for just a few euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple possibility of providing money here, and thus sell more luxury brands for beer bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably, to keep the richest customers from feeling ordinary, they're proding around with some cheap bags.
For example, Dolce & Gabbana can buy more than a thousand euro-paying shoulders.
An interpretation of Chanel’s armbag can, however, be carried out around EUR 6000.
Unlike most fashioners, the shoulders were not of some great fashion, but their story started further away.
It is claimed that the hang bags originate far from the Philippines, from which they have been carried wide.
In particular, it is not often seen with exporiars and locals walking around with them.
It is claimed that the flowering technique is from the 14th century, and is rather rare with normal corpuscence.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be as pungent as a basket, it is possible to absorb patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and more attractive.
For example, recently, there are particularly trendy bags with coloured caps or strips of leather.
The letter of thanks may, however, be sent primarily to actress Jane Birkin, who had never been seen before to be the biggest girded shoulder bag.
In fact, he fit his armbag with all kinds of clothing set, and he didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
At the popularity of bags today, however, it does not play a smaller role, but also that care for them is a cockhead and unlike all other Somalis, they do not need to be maintained by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As in the case of trending, after classic appearance, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you want to, you can get yourself a pendant or a tiny shoulder cap.
At the same time, it is worth bearing in mind that the classic shoulder bag will never go out of fashion, but on the velgrid.
But what about the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries there have been classicized in a bag of straws that reminds me of its style of baskets, it is open and short, as well as straws and sands.

GMB is worried about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company expects confirmation from the managers of the cookie producer McVitie's of long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silenced the future investment of the Tollcross object.
The plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The owner of McVitie's company on Pladis said that they have invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years.
It was hired by employees and the presidents of the trade union, “are the first to hear, if anything changes in the activity of the factory.
In a letter addressed to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to “distribut their concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines.
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we do not get the clarity of the object’s chief executive regarding the business needs and the investment plan of Tollcross, makes our members deeply concerned.
It has worked here on multigenerational families and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people around Glasgow, and it is essential to provide support for decent employment in a region where there is high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow and in terms of Brexit, an increase in living expenses and a rapidly growing production productivity in McVitie, in the light of the chronic decline in production, is needed.
Pladis’ representative said: “The object manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to it because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago a regular meeting between the employees and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where several problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are looking at our activities in an ongoing way - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested over GBP 5 million in the Tollcross object, most of which have gone into production lines and improved operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as a legacy of the production object, and if there is any change in the activity of the object, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear from it.
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not allow Neymar to be lured into his lines by offering an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest?
This massive approach has opened the summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than twice the buyover of the present world records, set up during the previous season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymaris will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will be paid after payment from PSG for over 500 000 pounds per week.
Barcelona is known to be angry as a result of both the approach and the breaking of Neymar, although a close source to the Catalans Board confirms that the club has always been the best lookout for the football player since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world about this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in concluding an agreement with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs thinking about hiring one of the best players in PSG.
“I’m not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, we’ll respond to them and contact their players, ” said Al-Khelaifi.
\"We all respect clubs.
But when they try to sign a contract with one of our players, they have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line because earlier this summer the Spanish club showed an interest in the PSG central player Marco Verratt.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow Italy to leave under any conditions and that Barcelona could get a feedback as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
“Brex is seriously threatening to hit the road between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland, ” warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it, ” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for people and goods to move freely, said Varadkar.
“ This is our vision for the future: build bridges, not borders, ” he stressed.
According to the treasurer, he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union and, since it is not able to do so, remain a part of the European single market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The second option of making Britain's exit more smooth would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noteing that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “We could definitely have such an agreement with Great Britain.
The alternative would be to return to the customs offices, which would declare historical divide and political failure.
“The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace, ” said the Irish Prime Minister.
He described Brexit as a challenge for our generation and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.
The Märt Avand, who passed his first half of the triathlon, is able to pass through Ironman.
Today, in the winter capital, the largest Triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held at Otepää, when about a thousand triatletes from more than thirty countries took place in the half of the Ironman competition.
The 70,3 miles long distance ranged 1.9 km from swimming, 90 km from riding and 21,1 km from riding a bike.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life also completed the Märt Avand.
“I thought it would prove complicated, and eventually it was complicated, ” said Avand at the finish.
Despite the complexity, the Avand found that the triathon was actually a forceful head for everyone.
“Not murdering a distance, but killing a pace, ” he said, suggesting that a strong pace would reach the finish of every head.
Except Otti Sepp: “Even though a physical person is fine, he does not know how to swim.
The opening had been a great practice since February.
It started four to five hours a week, and then ten hours a week.
In 05:34:12 he reached 270 in the overall accounts.
Although the Opener lost both to Raio Rajio (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won the other so-called ‘prominents’ in the class.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost the Avant in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The men of the Otepää stage of the Ironman series were crowned by German Johannes Moldan with time 3:58:27, the best of Estonians was Ivo with the Great Time 04:14:09.
Among the women, Helle Frederius won with 04:24:01, while the Estonians were Maria Jussi, who lost to Frederinsen in about half an hour, and by 04:58:58.
An opener passed a swimming distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410.
