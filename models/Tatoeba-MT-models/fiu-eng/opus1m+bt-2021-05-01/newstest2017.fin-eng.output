A 28-year-old chef was found dead at the mall in San Francisco.
The 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead at the top of the local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he has no idea who would have wanted to hurt him, and he says:
The body found at the Westfield Mall Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Sanfranciscollian Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Mortal Researcher's office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined as a criminal offence and that the investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the AC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously acted as a bus stop in Boston, had received his dream job as a line cooker at the Sanfranciscoian Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they were, uh, terrified and upset because of his death.
\"We have a small team that works like a tight family, and they're going to miss him very much,\" the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was at the beginning of the night, but that recently, things went really well.
He found a place to live and dated a girl, Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good guy, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling his solidarity with the family was to cook us, make us dinner, Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of fights.
He was a brother who was driving with the stream.
\"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a sandless diamond that shined brighter every day,\" he said.
All those who have information about this are asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's reference line to 415-575-4444.
Doctors’ strike: Requirements for new work-fighting measures
Doctors' representatives have asked their trade union to adopt new work-fighting measures in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) invites the Council as a whole to support new work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to take on concerns about the agreement.
In July, doctors and doctoral students voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters rejected it.
In his letter to JDC President Ellen McCourt, published via Twitter on Thursday night, said that the government had remained “supervised ” about issues which he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: \"In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject fully the proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiations of all your concerns:
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for the gradual and expanding work struggle programme early in September.
The dispute has been followed by the participation of doctors in six strikees this year, including the first complete job suspension in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA medical practitioners, doctor Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected after the agreement had been negotiated, under the conditions recommended by BMA.
He had informed the members of the BMA at the meetings before the 54 000 medical practitioners and student vote that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: external association?
Ele, who ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday with each other and declared the battle of eight months of words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I was clearly impressed that in Ankara they wanted this reconciliation more.
Yes, the event was handled.
But Putin's smile looked gloomy, and he didn't even threaten heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayip Erdogan kept talking about his dear friend Putin five times according to a report.
I got lost in my bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the level prior to the crisis, but even to the better.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal represented opposition.
But the Putin-raised violin showed that nothing has been forgotten by the Russian leader.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down the Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankar for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a known friend.
Rebuilding true confidence will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The public opinion of Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious accusations by senior officials were that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trafficking in Syrian territories controlled by Isis.
He's been a hard-on to deny.
But in Peter, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received his request for forgiveness from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of an underarmed armour are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power in a failed coup of power last month.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
In addition, there is an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been severe, in particular, a ban on charter flights, which generally carry several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast annually.
The amount has fallen by nearly 90 per cent.
For Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines are certainly relieved when flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season's rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
You put the tomatoes back here, like the Vedemosti newspaper's report was formulated.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup d'état.
In addition to its long-lasting grudges about the advanced EU membership negotiations, Puti, who is eager to exploit the coolness and undermine Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader was sure to get out of Ankara where he called after the revolution attempt to support the appointed authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, which is deeply rooted in the exchange of its fear.
So this meeting in the French maritime scene enabled the external association presented by Russia and Turkey - as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that have experienced abandoned them and treated them wrong, combining their forces.
However, these two have great differences, despite the public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed to the role of the peacemaker, but in which Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of talk that after almost three hours of discussions, the Presidents told the press that they had not even discussed it.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering their differences in relation to the question, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a complete disaster in NATO member of Turkey shooting down a Russian combat plane, it is certainly better that the two leaders are once again on speaking terms.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from non-Scotland customers
According to the Bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told Scotland that the RBS brand joined the bank's international objectives.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
The Bank's strategies have been using the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance markets at this time.
It was supported by millions of pounds used for international sports sponsorship, Six Nations Rugby Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But it is now considered right to allow national brands to come first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it is not re-launched.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except for the main office and stock exchange lists are changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already available to customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed in a round of clients and staff at Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “RBS will become our investor brand and our employees' employer, because we now become much more brand bank -
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has increased the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It is now time for us to move towards the branding bank, because basically (we were asking) it is about how we can concentrate on making this a better bank for our customers, ” said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done in focus on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettor wins Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3000 wins
Dettor showers champagne after a double win he has a total of 3000 wins
The S.H.I.E.L.D. Frankie Dettor confirmed the 3,000th British victory in Newmarket Friday.
He reached the pilgrimage with his second victory in his home track competing with the Predilection coached by John Gosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, who achieves this pilgrimage in competition.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time master jockey Dettor, who won earlier at Ghayyary, said: \"This is special.
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettor sucks his own cheers when he brings out Predilection after victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in the obstacle competition, master jockey Richard Johnson, and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had record breaking his career with over 4300 winnings.
Lester Piggot, 9 times Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best shielders in the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only few have reached before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical nobles separate him from the rest of the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador to competitions, his zeal and his charisma have been pulling fans of the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have been riding with 6,000 winners if he weren't just a jockey for weekend and big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding winners in Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a living person who is a good thing for British competition, but besides that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated the philanthropy with a flying landing from the fairy tale.
From flying endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettor has been the face of a British competition for two decades.
It's been a mountain course.
In 1996 he also survived an airplane accident and suffered a competition ban because of drugs.
Three years ago, she had a hard time returning to her after six months of competition, but she showed significant strength in challenging suspects and returning to her best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettor has said earlier that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin separates chief chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly resigned Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circuit for many years.
63-year-olds have now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.
The Kreml opinion stated that Putin has ordered Ivanov to move away from the duties of the President of the Russian presidential administration, but no reason was given.
Ivanov's Deputy Director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later led the President's staff on protocol and government, says on the Kreml website (the Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: \"Thank you for your trust.\"
I believe that the most important task of administration is to support your activities as Head of State as regards the draft laws and the management of the implementation of your directives.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Vaano be appointed as his replacement.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a business that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet security service at KGB.
As head of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew from their request.
But despite the smile of the cameras, only a few here are convinced, especially now, just before the elections.
So this is just some sort of power-fighting after-the-count?
Nobody knows yet.
However, the official claim that the man once advertised as a potential candidate for President, suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy, has been accepted with serious doubt.
In his comments on the Kreml website, Putin Ivanov said: ‘It is true that early in 2012, I asked you to give me this very complex responsibility for four years, whether I could even say a job, the task.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months...
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He used to act as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service at the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service in the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people whom he trusted most.
One time it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Puti after the second period, because Putin's third period would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another Putin’s close ally, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister before his return to president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got his shoes on after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in the physical dispute last month at the scene of the series in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios announced that he was separated in the joint opinion.
Mr Gibson, acting as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his resignation.
There were creative differences and a fight at the scene.
I regret that it happened, he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from a series of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old Dharma & Greg event media has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it everything I can for the last 12 years, and Gibson said in a statement published Friday.
I had hoped to be with you to the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible working group, and above all the best fans you can have.
The start of the twelfth production period has been planned for the 28th of September.
The mystery fish ended up in the garden in Bang.
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windmills left behind by the water cycle.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published a film on the manifestation in Periscope, hoping that someone could explain the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing crossing: Bridge extends now to Fifee
The project of GBP 1,35 billion is now expected to be ready by May 2017
Engineers have combined Queensferry's crossing area with both the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fifee.
It's the first of four feathers between the decks that are now closing around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 strips.
The project of GBP 1,35 billion is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in building Queensferry’s crossing point.
We will all prove the truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used over 30 000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the finalisation of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a demanding operation where extreme exact dimensions must be agreed.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge is now in place and the last part of your concrete is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions project, said: “The first lock on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project this lock represents the tip of construction technology.
After the latter part of the road was installed and connected to the expanding north pole roadway, we then had to close the remaining portion from the north, or from the inland, to the north.
This was done by drawing 700 millimeter south on the north side of the bridge.
This was a huge and, at the same time, a very demanding measure.
Major, because the ground is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6000 tonnes and was to be drawn about 3% at the angle of the slope.
The requirement, because the allowed deviations, according to which the team worked, were small, only a few millimetres in both directions.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: The three men are very happy while they're alive.
Three men are very happy to be alive after they fell off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made a alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely as their boat continued to move on to themselves.
We saw the boat circle closer to the men, and we imagined the worst, Moelfre's lifeboat poet Vince Jones said.
Well, fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we started moving, he added.
The local fishing boat was rescued from two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from the boy without life jackets.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and returned to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “These three men in the water are lucky while they are alive and completely unharmed.
There was a dead end in the boat's engine, but somehow it had removed the boat from the time person when the boat fell.
Someone's taking care of these guys tonight.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to spend their leisure time watching the evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people rise up on the couch and participate in some activity.
Display time was initially limited to television, then video games, and now to smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to the wild called Pokémon Go. A application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they were created by a series of drawings, playing cards and other downstream products).
As many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was delayed, as a huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days did Pokémon Go have more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smart phones in search of Pokémons, which are traced by GPS, and which can be-lighted after discovery, (by means of a phone screw-up) or -
The generation that played the game younger has joined the wild and jumped up from the couch to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in daily steps for the average.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which is followed by 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of publishing the game, the number of people moving within 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of the users following the Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of practice.
The demands of many public health campaigns are being found on the 30th, the rise in the couch and the active every day, have not produced any results because most of the public health warnings are boring and are transmitted by people who seem to be unhappy.
However, the importance of sport cannot be reduced.
Regularly moving people are at a lower risk of getting cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
The beauty of Pokémon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something that they enjoy.
This will cover the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air, sunlight, and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they're hunting.
As usual, bad-ass filthmen are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were applications like Fitzbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
There will be a loss of novelty and a loss of use in due course.
However, the success of Pokémon will lead to other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Bales caught gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energic jump.
A smooth boom.
I can't believe it.
It's great everywhere.
And now, eventually, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast achieved a multi-play championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world to appear in the Olympic lights.
His total score, 6.2.198, was clearly better than his teammate Hopedidealist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian Pronssimist Aliya Mustafina.
In the US’s Simone Biles balance shop, the multi-play of women’s teline gymnastics in the individual final 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The party became a fourth American woman, who has consistently won a multi-party championship, and all in all, the fifth American champion. At the same time, she strengthened her generation and perhaps the best of all times.
He broke into tears when his final points were announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same class with the other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have brought his species up to a new level:
Biles has ruled his species for the last three years, winning the 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, programs that have had such an amazing mixture of ambition and accuracy, that in 1984 the Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him a gymnast to be seen as the best.
The last test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Back home from the family to Texas Spring, without the rough gold medals, it would have been a disappointment.
Simone Bales, on the left, and Aly Raisma hugs after winning the multi-play of women's teline power in the individual final 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, August.
Bales reached his first medal on Tuesday when he was at the opening party of the resident national team coordinator Martha Karoly.
Although Bales claimed that he had never thought about the future when walking long, I knew that it was not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - the one with his trademark's volts - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
Of this girl, whom her grandparents adopted as a taperon, whom Coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on a study trip at the gym where Boorman trained, she has become a force factor.
He has not lost in a multi-party game since summer 2013, and this winning pipe will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Blackfina was in a small chair after two rounds, it was only a illusion.
The balance bomb and the permant in which Biles is a dominant world champion were waiting.
He rose to the top at boom points 15.433 and exceeded them by getting 15.933 perman.
Raisman used to hug him in good faith when they waited for the final points - just the formality - and the tears rose to the eyes of the Bales glytter red, white and blue, when the dream from which he once wrote his playbook became true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of revolution from four years ago when he was divided in third place, but lost to the Bronze Mustafina in the renewal.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, called the American \"grandfather\", was clearly in charge.
He sent air kisses to the public after his performance in an emotional attack for a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as the Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old's extensive twist from this week's time will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims of serial murder were shot when they listened to music in the car
During the first serial killer attack in Phoenix last decade, two women were killed and a 12-year-old girl was sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
According to the authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on 12 June.
The report states that the shooter on the passenger side of the car fired the handbag up to eight times and then fled on the other vehicle.
According to the police, the death of three doesn't seem to have been the result of the robbery, because the attacker didn't take purses or another adult victim for $2,900.
The Phoenix police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that shooting allowed researchers to examine whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
All in all, seven people have died and two wounded in the ninth attack in four months, which has been carried out in two mainly Latin American cities.
This is what happens in the residential area in front of the home, Howard said earlier this month to KPHO, a CBS subsidiary.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as Nissan, Black BMW in the late 1990s and White Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence which led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked to each other and that the same killer had done.
Ellis, 33, got into the hospital where he died later because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which occurred only half an hour before the third death, targeting a empty open van, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Researchers found bullet casings, bullet seat and bullet fragments in the engine room.
The mother of a six-year-old with microcefal:
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
\"When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all - of course I made a promise, he said.
To him and his husband, Vincent, it was told that Edmund may never learn how to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
My first reaction was that 'they still didn't know people were doing it', Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with his walk.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was only three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly achieving some milestones.
He walks with help and he rides on his bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth will show me how to use the notes that Edmund's inventions makes.
We teach him a sign language, Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language he says that Edmund has invented some of his own links.
Microkephal may be due to a number of reasons: genetic, such as Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as ashes or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those who have received Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by a uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers with babies with birth defects from Zika.
It'll make things easier.
You can believe things will make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Massive rains and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
In Louisiana, the governor was allowed to declare emergency on Friday, waiting for more rain in the state on Saturday.
National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their oxen and caused widespread flooding due to extreme rains.
John Bel Edwards, Governor of Louisiana, said that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is already coming to the needy districts.
Mike Steele, the Governor's office for safety and emergency situations, said they're getting requests for rising water transports, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that alone, the Tangihohokahoa county asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flooder is valid until Saturdays in a large part of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service stated in the opinion that three to five cents more rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama the flood was valid on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River in the vicinity of Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
The weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood in several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of the Ascension district along the river, when flooding rivers slowly drop to Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi state border, Tickfaw River, which flows to Lousia in Liverpool, was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
The saviors were still picking up people from flood water in the Amita and Wilkinson districts at lunchtime in Mississip.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and his stepdaughter were close to Glos on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that, normally, at over 400 feet away from his house, the Beaver Creek water rose rapidly during the night.
He says he was warned by another boy who lived nearby.
We woke up, and the water just went on to get up, Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the stream of water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family have injuries in all of them, and that he is the only one with knowledge.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved a three-man in a large, military-style truck and took them to Gloria's fire station, where the rescued nights spent on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly, as heavy pollution continues, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness close to Livingston reports 13,75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had continued to be a burden since the middle of the week.
The flooding of the rough rains and streets led to the rescue of the people of the Tangiphoa county from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities reported.
The CBS’s subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahhoa, a town council member said 200 homes were under a flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both are now under fire.
The President of the Region, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets that had been left as islands of rising water.
The cities of Amiten and Hammond have opened shelters for those who have been evacuated.
- They're allowed to return to their homes when the water begins to fall, he said.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangihoma, some 20 streets were closed due to rising water, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
\"The latest flood was here in March,\" said Lacy Landrum, the city administration.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississip, the Emergency Director of Harrison County, Mr. Rupert Lacy, said that a flat rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far, no floods have been reported.
The director of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amitessa, Keith Townson, has lived in the region for 40 years.
\"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before,\" Townson said, \"and the rain continues,
- Full of bullets, six years old, Mahaj Brown will be able to survive the Philadelphia shooting.
Police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means shooting another six-year-old in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
My grandparents say that Brown had multiple gunshot wounds, including joints, legs, arms and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
He suffered a lot. His little body was full of bullets. The boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been called critical and he has been subjected to several cuts.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first class at the local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown quarter.
Three men were also shot, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in steady state according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating if one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there were crosses between several shooters.
The types of assault-related rifles that came from different attack weapons filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were seals on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in an active battle, the Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginadi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old girl, she got the delusional shot on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year's Olympic team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team involves three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie-Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by a Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
This team looks, finally, from America.
It has also established itself at the top of the black and Latin American women's involvement.
The most successful female teamer in the past four years has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as a Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but masterly gymnast programs.
On Thursday, Simon became a fourth American woman who has consistently won individual gold in a multi-play of women.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not appear in this gymnastic halls across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all went the same path as Aly and Madison reached the Olympic team.
They are-Final Five (last five) because the next Olympic gymnastic team will have only four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive species, and gymnastics are generally trained in private gymnastics, maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel charges (trainers and their gymnastics, families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnasiums are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnastics get all their training, and this is a precious and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they began their gymnastics.
We should bring more affordable and available gymnastic training to communities where many young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, are living.
I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations we have offered free and affordable gymnastics for over 15 000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide a high level of gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
The gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the perseverance, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team's inspiration will get thousands of young girls to begin their gymnastics, and that's great.
Sports participation is so important, especially for girls.
We're having an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious girl power by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Doctors are organising new strike after Jeremy Hunt's proposal has been rejected.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to the improved agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37 000 voted doctors rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, namely that NHS was on an unfeeling ground, and that even small additional delays are damaging staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend work processes to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Doctors, said last night: \"The medical practitioners are still seriously concerned about the proposed agreement, in particular that it will stimulate the existing labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors in a balanced manner.
When only eight weeks are left before the first group of doctors are transferred, progress has to be made and the time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have given the government the unwillingness to participate and sometimes to engage in deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
\"Jeremy Hunt must now act, eliminate sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he does not do so, doctors are ready to continue their work struggles.
The most recent strike at the end of April meant a delay of nearly 13 000 routine surgery and 100,000 receptions when nurses and consultants were recruited to act as clients in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the debate by agreeing to the improved agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend wage with 54,000 doctors under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the head of NHS Employers, appealed to doctors to avoid strike.
Mortimer said: “There is very little or nothing at all in the struggles, but they put pressure on the teams and services already in need of preparation, as well as concerns, anxiety and disturbances in patients, carers and their families,
Over the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of monitoring (Guardia Role) and revelations (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful to have a continuous positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from the Sabbath, the cost of training, mutual recognition of the educational programme, the freedom of study and gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of the serious importance of employers, the Health Education England Training Organisation and the Ministry of Health regarding the respect of agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds per day after the authorities recommended that it be given longer to people.
The medicine used to prevent blood clots, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or seizures.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people get a heart attack in England every year, and one quarter of them get a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to the fat material accumulated on the artery wall, which forms a narrowing process.
If a clot breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the circulation of the blood into the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot goes off, it can pass through the blood and cut the blood circulation into the brain causing stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca, the Isobritanian company, and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely.
In the draft NICE published today, it is recommended that 90 mg of ticagrelor be administered for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective prevention treatments, even one quarter of people who have a heart attack will later receive another heart attack or stroke, with the consequences of which are often devastating.
The fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommendation, we are pleased to add the available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor are limited during periods of more than three years in particular as regards the risk of bleeding, no longer treatment is recommended in the draft guidance than during this period.
The culture of political correctness allows the flowering of election crops in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahma, was removed last year because of corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the fact that the widespread fraud of vote in Muslim communities has been ignored, the shocking government report today is being revealed.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Minister of Government, provides police, election overseers and city councils for ignoring the evidence of electoral violence and religious hypersensitivity.
The former Community Secretary, the current emperor of corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up surveillance chains for the protection of scared voters.
He recommends that voters should present a certificate of identity when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only needs to say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the voter’s finger be put on the undefeated ink so that no one can vote twice.
We should better protect the phenomena, sir Eric says.
He calls for greater media access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or by the working group.
\"This would not only protect the elections, but would protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the election,\" he said.
The government ordered a report as a result of the vote scandal at the London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed as a result of the many charges for corruption and illegal acts.
The Court found that Rahman’s cynically distorted the religious feelings of his Muslim community and rejected the accusations of his critics of racism and Islam.
Rahman is said to have run his election campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Even 300 votes were suspicious or the result of a person voting in another.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of the wild animal in the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about the vote in the election elections, where members of the high-value Muslim community were told to pressure the people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the proof of identity with the ID card.
He says: “The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were put to the vote, according to the older people’s will, particularly in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
\"We were concerned that... the state institutions had ignored such behaviour because of the \"politically correct\" race and the hypersensitivity to religion...
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including the prohibition of political activists being allowed to handle the voting tickets received by mail so that the votes could be collected.
The report that Theresa May reviews also calls for more stringent amendments to be made to the register in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person voting the undefeated ink so that no one can vote twice.
Run systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit on the vote by automatic mail to requests.
prevent political activists from dealing with the sound and envelopes that have been produced through the mail in which the voices are sent.
Let the police set security chains around the polls.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of fear based on the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography at the polls illegal.
Require that only English is used at voting points (except in Wales).
Reinforce training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter should go to the knock alone.
Sir Eric blows up the police force in Great London, saying it's... It's amazing... not after the Tower Hamlets case.
\"The Court of Justice would remain following numerous acts of corruption and illegality by Lutfur Rahman and his officials,\" he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticised the inefficient box checks at the city council voting registers.
Sir Eric said: “The last year's Tower Hamlets judgment was a wake-up.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birth of the parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of election and the prohibition of the facts of certain groups is a threat to this good reputation.
Hulluna Kate's biker double-breed and other famous photos at Rio Olympics
This week fans of Rio's 2016 Olympics have gone out of the French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the active double being of Duchest Cambridge.

And in fact, when he became aware of the excitement of social media, the archer admitted that he had heard from childhood that he looked like Leo.
Well, I don't see a big deal, except for a beard, Brady told Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly emerge this year: the eloquent convergence between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina's greatest, obvious eyes have been said to be a Cuban American singer of Gloria Estefan's dual being.

The Olympic Commissioner for the CBC applies an apology to the Chinese swimmer’s death as well as to the pig
The analysis of Byron MacDonaldi in the fourth post of Ai Yanhan, instead of women’s 4x200 metres of free swimming, raged the viewers of the CBC’s direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has been supposed to apologize since one of its browsers said during the race that 14-year-old Chinese women's swimmers were as evil as the smell and death of the pig.
Rapporteur Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions with women 4x200 metres of free swimming in the music fiction.
MacDonaldi, who came to CBC's browser team, heard the phrase, \"That little 14-year-old from China, he'd go to sleep, baby.
Too eager, like a bad smell, disappeared like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The second part of the message was opened at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Taylor Ruck of Canada, which allowed Canada to catch China.
The viewers of all over Canada react quickly when they are shocked by the language and its design used.
Emmett Macfarlane was saying, \"Does the CBC browser just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer \"death like a pig\"?
The idiot didn't realize he was still in direct transmission.
Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as: “This little 14-year-old from China baked, baby-
A review of Byron MacDonald against Twitter was hot and fast, when many people challenged him.
Twitter users didn't arrest themselves when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who ran a CBC mission, apologized in the live mail for MacDonald's comment, saying: “We want to know that the comment about swimming was sent.
It was a unfortunate choice of words. We regret that this was the case.
The CBC concluded to apologize more than 90 times for people who hadwit the answer to the comment.
Scott Russell, with his colleague, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and associated an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The Tv company also quickly apologized and published the statement.
We deeply regret the fact that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Yesterday evening, we quickly took action and asked our viewers, as well as our followers, in the social media, to forgive us in a direct transmission.
For the sake of clarity, it has to be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live mail and tried to define his remark that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
I'd like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after women's messages. He said at the CBC Olympics.
- I've tried to get a swimmer, not as a person, but as a person.
\"It is unnecessary to say that I did not mean it disrespectful, and that I am really sorry,\"
Primark's client was shocked by a woman who was babblingly matching underwear in the middle of the shop
The customers didn't know what to watch when she took off in the middle of Primark's movement to try underwear.
Things did not improve the fact that after assessing what he looked like in his pants, a woman peeled them out of her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually agreed on four underwear in a shop located at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkeston, where she made up underwear and then put them back in shelves
At the same time, the mother of two children who were at the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after she tried her underwear, a mysterious woman went over and walked away without buying anything.
He said, \"The people didn't believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took the pair of underwear, took off her own stockings and underwear, and put her tone.
He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation. He was just standing there shameless.
- Everyone was staring, and then he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did the same for three more couples before he finally decided he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
He didn't seem to care who looked at him or who thought about the person who would end up buying the underwear he agreed to.
33 - year - old Davidson, living in the city of Kent, said: “I hate to think that someone is taking underwear to their home, tried by someone else, but not cleaned up.
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I was told that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes after the woman left, which is fine.
\"It would be a terrible thing to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and removed them, and has not been washed up,
Primark’s representative said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August in Folkestone’s movement.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale,
In this way you can defend yourself against armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the Krav Te Federation's great master Rhon Mizrach, New York City, to find out how to deal with gun-sucking robbers at a close distance.
Then you were approached in front or in the back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker at the same scale.
According to Mizrach, if you're approaching behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and arrows on the line of fire.
After that, you'll grab the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker on your face with your spare elbow.
Continue hitting the knee into the neck, and when the attacker goes into pain, turn the gun out of his hand, hit him with a gun on his face, and hold the gun pointed at him.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the offender cannot fire.
Put the weight on the gun at the same time and hit the attacker in his chest, then turn the gun on his side, back off, and show him with the gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video of how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Magen's champion, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright is licking the dirtiest places in Europe for the trip guide
The British tourist has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and night-scraper places.
Suffolk's leader and travel author Ian Wright, 51, licked euro banknotes, covered in Piccadilly Circle, a train toilet squealer, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a photometer to show himself and to us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment that was made with the name of the film, called \"Integral Power\", produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a train towel used by thousands of people may seem completely hostile, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way to Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about the confirmation of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked left him with the rest of his evil taste.
Wright became a well - known tester of intestinal endurance when he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, which goes from the public rail station to the toilet seat’s squealing license, was indeed tested by his immune system.
In a film he said: “From childhood I have been quite anxious about my health, and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, worms, and fucking water.
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused to do was filthy Russian public toilet.
He had over 4,000 units on the photometer when he was on his screen.
Because of the comparison, the reading of the respondent’s hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public village, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the opposing hands was less than 60.
Wright has produced a film of tourists, along with Finnish mechanics, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In a movie, the wedding said: \"This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet.
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything 'cause it's so much to sleep in here.
Following the inner strength was produced together with the Finnish mechanic, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic bacteria and vitamin C and vitamin D, which help to enhance the effectiveness of human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of the selection of snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer our consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time, to explain the interests of the probiotics.
We had a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up with the idea of \"let's call Ian\".
They argue that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, about the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film gives us an interesting way to tell consumers more about it.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the documentary director, added: \"Let's say this, if Ian had been licked at some of the things I asked him for, like a nighttime Russian visit in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him,
Clearly, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty maids.
In the 2015 selection survey, 84% of respondents specifically associated lactic acid bacteria with the welfare of the stomach and intestine, and 58% said that they at least occasionally use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The green family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall Saltashi, before the wedding.
The Electric family caused damage to its rental house of £50,000 after they were exterminated because of the terroristisation of their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner, Shaun Trebilcock, have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltashi since they had been complained about many times.
When they had been removed by force from the property, the shocked housing company’s employees stated that the property was in poor condition.
The walls were made with evaporative openings, the floor boards were torn, the waste was spread to the floor, and the walls were crushed with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Houston, said that he was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I do not think people should have to live in this way.
There are a lot of things to consider here, since this property is probably known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is in poor condition, and their names are in poor shape.
There were three boys who lived in the area between the two years, and according to the police, the fear of the family was involved in a street fight with baseball bats, intimidation of the loved ones, drug use, drug sales, and excessive screaming, quarreling and curse.
In June, a 47-year-old named Skelldon received a decision on non-social behaviour.
There were old waste found in many rooms in the house under the discharge.
The property, from which drugs were hand-to-hand, had been pulled up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police regularly called.
Cornwall Houston became a forcemaker for a woman and her partner's property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, \"They didn't care about anyone,\"
We lived next door for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
This morning, we didn't get a dream.
We got up because it was so quiet in here we haven't used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone,
Adam Fitzpatrick, the Executive Director of Cornwall Houston neighborhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police have often called the property.
The trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: “It is a pity that the citizen took no responsibility for his or her own conduct and for the conduct of his or her family, for the eviction is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Houston.
This was a very difficult case, because the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have been detested by neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave, informed community members.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in twenty.
A dirty pillow left on the floor of one bedroom after the wedding
The housing company's employees now have to clean up the waste floors around the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid on the property and found over 70 g of cannabis as well as a vase, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received fines when he was given his guilt in the possession of a class b drug as a plan to distribute it.
He claimed that money was intended for the tombstone of his son Lee Skelldon, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partners live homeless now being frozen in private accommodation in Plymouth.
For many house-room walls, graffiti was maimed.
The police say that they are trying to exterminate the residents who hold back the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall of the police said that the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continued to ridicule the rules.
\"This is a message for those who think that their conduct is without sanctions, and for those who suffer from such conduct,\" he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when the military jet flew low on the beach
Sun worshipists in the Averi of Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion took off a really low aircraft.
The Air Force said that it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, terrified tourists began to panic when a low-flight jet wiped over a beach full of people.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft reached almost a touch distance from the solar lights on the sand track in North Portugal Aveiro.
The holidayers stood up when they began to understandably worrying about the noise from the shower machine, even though they did not begin to see what was coming towards them behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who published videos of a dramatic bypass in the social media was Daniel Fernandos, who said: “It went down twice really low, and one thing seemed to be falling to the ground.
The Nuno Arroja added: \"I was surfing, and it really felt like the machine was falling on me,
The tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Forces today said that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify fishing vessels close to the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably lower than usual because of the poor visibility caused by the smoke of nearby land-tops, but the Air Force convinced that no one was at risk.
Land fires have destroyed parts of Manner-Portugal this summer, and four people have died on Madeira's island.
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the pilot had to fly in low visibility due to the adverse conditions, the smoke caused by the land stops and the thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training pilot, the pilot was requested to identify fishing vessels
Exote's first half score better than expected
In June, the social and health district of southern Karelia (Exote) produced a better result of EUR 3.4 million.
The exote profit amounted to EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to eliminate institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was granted in all activities.
Exote is working to reduce the range of measures this year.
Exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The percentage that is left over may be used to shorten the lines and buy the measures for patients.
The annual result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exoten Government will discuss the mid-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special ice caps was sworn by a soldier in Immola
Of the 70 vice presidents of the Border and Coast Guard School, they took a military light on Friday.
The military lights of the Border and Coast Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
The 10 special border icebreaker course was held in the backup sports field.
A soldier's oath was made by 70 backup men.
Special border ice creamers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, the special border ice cream was applied for by 310 young people.
They were invited to a selection test of 250.
Special ice creams have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five vets of the border forces of the war were involved in the meeting of the vetrane on the occasion of the ceremony.
The average age of those who are included is now 90 years.
Veterans who attended the oldest event have been born in 1918.
A limited amount of crime ahead - criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 Finnish police stations since the beginning of 2014, the RTA unit has been involved in criminal intelligence and analysis.
The operation of the unit is invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna are included in the Hämeenlinna police station.
It's being pulled by the Lahti-based sergeant.
Chief of Staff is working in Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everybody works in a civilian suit.
The Unit has demonstrated its suitability and necessity, considered Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides other police officers with different reports.
In trouble, it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police practice.
The goal has been to prevent crimes, i.e. to keep the police going down less and less often until they get the alarm.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will help target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of police, a criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, three national units were established and each police department has its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre, working in the context of the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, is responsible for national action.
PTR units are known to be working with people from the police, Tuuli and Rajavartilaitos.
The RTA units, in turn, work in areas shared by police authorities and provide information to both local police and national units.
Extensive intelligence outside its territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also goes beyond the limits of its own institution, because it also does crime.
People working in RTA have better basic police skills.
The Unit shall endeavour to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or crimes similar to each other by means of registers, alert databases and findings.
This is called saviding, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint can also be seen at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
On an artificial basis, the factor forms a certain kind of image.
It can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals Learn Their Errors
RTA employees do not carry the collars up in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
Neither own nor criminal practice is reported because it could lead to professional offenders developing their activities and thereby preventing police crime firms.
The police will report on these practices publicly if they are predicted to pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the early summer of news, the way in which empty dwellings were used in housing fractures.
In it, the authors put the outer door of the apartment into a stick, a single needle, or a tapeboard where they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest ones are ordering a record of the district court, which, for example, shows that fingerprints have been found on the site.
The next time we steal, we go with gloves.
The interview has been held with Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppa of Hämee Police, Inspector Tuoma Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuimela from Central Crime Police.
The police are gathering and analysing information to plan practical action.
Background for a reduction in labour and financial volumes.
The first steps towards a new mode of action were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl associated with my father killed in Syria in London
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Isis, is reportedly dead in Syria.
Counselor Tasmen Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead in the Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News announced that she was believed dead in the Russian air strike in Raqha, which is the base of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning an escape from the country of war and is returning to Britain.
You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and a testament to others that there is real risk of leaving the war zone - that it could make people give up for making such a decision, Akunjee said.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other Austrian schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they went by bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had been married to an Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow just after a few months.
Reid says Clinton's considering Garland's Supreme Court as a candidate if he's elected
Senator Harry Reid says he's convinced that candidate for President-designate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court if elected president.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, the leader of the majority of the Senate, says that the next president will choose a member of the late Supreme Court to replace Anton's Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday in a phone conference that he would predict - with some sort of certainty - Clinton's chosen Garland.
The representative of Reid later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He congratulated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to hang the boat with a new choice.
Garland is head of the Supreme Court of the United States Court of Appeal District of Columbia.
Mr Reid said that Republicans, which prevent Garland, are candidates for Republican President Donald Trump's hands and options,
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says that the lower calendar is for women as well as for men,
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of being naked, they are going to find their next peak generation 2017 NU Muse calendar.
The president of Treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his high - quality journal of naked pictures differs from the old school's Playboy because \"Playboy is for men,\"
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
\"We must begin again to introduce timeless and classic nakedness in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by the images of these naked women,\" said Shaw in the press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in private open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: Who really buys records?
Lonesome, middle-aged men love vinyles.
Before you rush into fulfilling the commentation with an agitated insult, the author of which is a nickname NoAllStudentsKeski-aged Men, notice that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGoov, the new arrival of a lot of recorded albums is not because more and more people born of this millennium are excited about the loss of physical novelty, but about the middle age.
Apparently, those who soon bought a vinyl plate are the most likely 45 to 54-year-olds.
In fact, the most likely record purchase is for the 18-24-year-old age group.
The question is also not only about collecting amateurs but also about the sense that older buyers of vinyl are more likely to maintain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you think the results of YouGov are correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I go in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit over my head. I would be quick to point out before I stop, I'd form a cup of my hand, and I'd say something of dignity, like, \"Let's get a closer look at it.\"
Let's take a closer look at this.
At the same time that Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and stores, as well as office supplies, are now filled with buildings where there were previously independent movements - there are still a handful of great specialized record shops.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to assess their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55 followed by Sister Ray, two young women, three middle-aged men, Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends his afternoon in London due to a meeting, and spins shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - She says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, which appear above the picture (i.e. sent the sample by e-mail, did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge amount of disk and singles is partly the result of his available income: he can now buy records for which he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can buy again those that he sold when he was young and without money.
“Most of the materials I bought are from the late '60s and the early '70s, records that were published when there were 11 or 12, and I was probably a little too young to get them, ” she says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: \"I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my bad-ass.
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he met match the profile of YouGov.
However, he has noticed the new wave of people affected by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and who have come to need to buy their old albums back.
Based on my discussions, people have been deprived of their collection generally in 1998 or 1999.
The customers who sold their vinyls to buy cds now sell their cds to buy their albums back, he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl fertilisers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the discs?
In a shop like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer comfort for the same types of community.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly injured by the payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be ashamed of the digital world and choose to be confident about the stability of familiar record covers; objects that bring back memories of teenage days of happiness.
“I think sometimes it may be about filling the hole or some kind of comfort that we have to own, ” says Wez.
As a collector, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
We're like their social workers. The other employee suddenly said something about the record.
A April opinion poll conducted by ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, whereas 7% of those buying vinyl do not have a record player.
This is where the news report is likely to appear to be a serious concern on my back to the stack of Bosa nova collections.
This \"resurrection award\" approach is something that Jonny, 42, also works in Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men).
Some time ago, someone came in and said, \"I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead record so we can put it on a shelf,\" he says.
It is not a big one, but it is definitely happening.
More products, less music.
We've got people who say, \"I don't have a record player.
So not parents, but younger people, my late years, who are just getting excited about it.
In a Foppi, where today there is almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-six parks, tourists taking photographs, teen boys, and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned movements, it is great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to prove the pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes watching the various records in the sales.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so record collection is not really an option.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is... she's taking care of you in love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unique.
My last stopover is said to have awakened the generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time I try to make it look like I'm looking at a group of teenage girls who gather around the Polaroid cameras for a moment before my father and daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left, there is a stairwell with a wall covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac records: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, any material album of the average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorations, and some are so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's all about pure-art vinyls.
But given that even the small attention given to these objects can mean more money for industry and send some customers to Soho's friends for more, there is not much complaint here.
It is not surprising that the part of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that uses the most luxury ones, such as vinyls.
But even though I find that youGov's results are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and web forums.
These people are likely to work hard in school or office.
They certainly do not spend Thursday mornings painting around Berwick Street's record shops, covering records and avoiding a creepy, 30-year-old artificial TV drinker's eyes on this throat over the shoulders of men of middle age who don't know what they're looking at.
Holker is the most narrowest living animal - video report
Researchers say that the vault has a longer life span than any other planet's spine.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is on a female, whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and which is five metres long.
The French court rejects the application for the removal of goods from Jungle refugee camps
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to expel tens of temporary shops and restaurants from Camp Jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to break all 72 temporary trades in which people sell cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting or sell tea at 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food in a few euro-area restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office argued that the sites should be removed because they represent a non-paymentable parallel economy and are a risk of fire and cleaning.
The humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital, namely that free meals provided by the government-supported organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing amount of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
In Lille, the court ordered that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people who were engaged in temporary trade, but said that the prefect of Calais was fully understandable.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just the feeding of people living under extreme uncertain conditions.
He said that facilities offered peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under sails of the city was Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activities are unprofitable and which offers 200 meals daily, English and French lessons and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - top reading - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland are clearly falling faster than average in the EU
In Finland, food is very much reduced to the joy of consumers and to the shame of producers.
The price of food in Finland has decreased by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price in the EU was 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen to the second highest in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
In comparison countries only in Britain, the price of food has decreased faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the article of Ilkka Lehtinen, Director of Development of Statistics Finland, published in the Information & Trends blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportional to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest is June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation had to be alarmed.
\"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership became,\" Lehtinen says.
Then a turn followed, after which the food has become cheaper every year.
Now the price is heavy on the Russian food import bans that have cut off food exports from Finland to Russia.
This is why the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
“Point’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term, ” Lehtinen says.
The tightened price competition for industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
Large trade chains Group S and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been shown to be an impressive promotional campaign.
Finland, however, is still not a low-cost food stand, even though the price of food has decreased a great deal.
In 2015, food in Finland was one quarter the most expensive EU countries with a wage level similar to Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same VAT percentage, the most cheap food would be sold in Finland from countries like the same level of wages.
The paper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the analogue countries, only the Germans and Dutch would sell more expensive food than the Finnishs.
If we want to reach the level of food in the old EU countries at the cost, VAT should be added to the average level of EU countries and the price competition continues, the Lehtinen writes.
The paper points out that the VAT rates he has calculated are indicative.
School's not exactly the same anymore.
Returning to a school bench may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curricula have been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ from old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty writing is stopped, and instead schools begin to practice the codem.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education is already being read in four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of pupils.
It was thought that the teacher taught students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
We found the world's longest spine... ice sharks can live up to 400 years.
The coolest known Greenlandese shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches maturity only at 150 years of age.
It can then live for another 250 years, reporting a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest backbone of today’s world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed by only the Icelandic family whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenlandese sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females take dogs longer, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Since the rate of growth is low, it is observed that only about a centimetre per year, adult individuals have lived by force for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined all 28 of the adult ice sharks from the 28 female who had been caught by fishermen.
The fish age was exposed to radiocarbonisation in the eye lens.
The mean age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, amasonic fish of 493 and 502 cents, were exposed about 335 and 392 years old.
As previous studies have shown that icebergs reach up to four metres of maturity, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that point.
The research was published by Science.
Stockmann's firing almost 300 salesmen are not reduced
Almost 300 employees are released from Stockman.
Cooperative companies in a company in difficulty ended in the beginning of August.
\"As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs are reduced, the majority of which are being made redundant,\" says Stockmann when he reports.
According to this, the number of sellers in the goods sector is not reduced so that the customer service is not affected.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities will be offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann's y-t negotiations concerned some 3 000 workers.
At the start of their reduction, approximately 380 workers were estimated to be affected.
The reduction of the population aims at annual cost savings of some EUR 20 million, which are due to be achieved in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme aimed at achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in getting profitable from the grocery store.
Although the adjusted operating result of the Group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the commodity store is still losing.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, according to Stockmann’s CEO, sales in the stores have not reached the company’s objectives.
\"Unfortunately, the reduction of human populations is necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018 to 2018,\" says Veijalainen in the press.
The result improvement of the second quarter was based, in particular, on the good Lindex performance of the supply chain.
Ketju reached the best second quarter of all time turnover and result.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating profit was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover of this year will be reduced last year.
The correction's operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The centre of low pressure on the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist from HS.
There will also be rainfalls in the middle of the country, but the southwest will be pouts.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country is less than 20 degrees below mercury.
North rainy areas remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team is playing doping scandal - an odd explanation for the coach’s pace
John Anzrah, a Kenyan general sports coach, was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah played a ground team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP told me that the athlete Anzrah tried to show up is a 800-metre star called Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenya County Team, reported that Anzray’s identity was revealed after having given a sample of Rotichia in the surprise test.
Doping officials visited the Anzray authorities.
Soi says Anzrah was sent home because he committed a crime against the Kenyan national team.
He played as a athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use, Mr. Kip Keino, President of the Kenya Olympic Committee, to the Reuters news firm.
The Olympics’ public sports begins on Friday, and Rotich is expected to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich placed last year in the World Cups on his way to the fourth and is in advance Rio's winning recommendations.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan general sports team claimed that Anzrah only went to the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he'd be exposed, so the source told me.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s public sports stadium emptys
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least, they don't watch the public sports.
In Rio, a struggle was started on Friday on the scales of public sports, but the world's top departments were able to present their skills to a confusing, empty audience.
On Friday, Rio arranged that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day of the morning competitions and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening competitions were sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bullied with a cheerleading force.
The final tickets are already sold in Rio.
The Rio Olympic audience has been attracting attention even before sport.
For example, thousands of empty tyres have been seen in the views of rugby, melon and horse riding.
When Brazil’s medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played the beach balloon in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian twins, the Dutch played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000 people were full of the audience.
At least the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is a long way from European and Asian competitions, and many Olympic species are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to pull the football stadium to its full.
In the weekend Mario Andrada, the organiser of the competition, said that 82 percent of tickets had been sold, which is clearly less than four years ago.
- Andrada said, \"We still have 1.1 million left to sell,\"
Of the 8,5 million tickets to the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost nearly half more than Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euro to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
Volunteers and military personnel in the London Olympics were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because organisers need money and try to get tickets for last minute sale.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240 000 tickets to less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
At Rio's stadium, empty places were enough in the morning.
Even the beach ball in the Copacabana sand has no interest in the audience.
Jukka Central Hall competed in London in 2012.
I've had a lot of people on the press.
The new way of protecting the environment - acquisition of the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through the latest ways.
The Foundation established last year acquires its ownership of ecologically significant nature areas.
After that, private, business and entities may, with money, redeem land ownership rights.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that are available to those who wish to obtain right of ownership against payment.
The holder receives a veto right of 187 square blocks, which in practice means that there is no need for approval from each holder if the use of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring governance is something concrete that can be left to your inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying the banders or chaining yourself up somewhere to protect the environment.
The administrator of the administrative authority receives accurate location data from his section, allowing for example, a visit to the block.
On the website of the Foundation, the names of the holders of property rights are shown in the same map of which the land block data can be found.
The only risk that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea is the Levavikangas sees as a natural conservation acquisition.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation should act in some way in an ethical or commercial way, but should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect natural areas in such a way that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or offering.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but it has acquired initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more conservation countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to move from Australia.

Wheel thieves torture most of the cities in Turkey - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torture Turkey, for the most part, from large cities in Finland.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police on the basis of the number of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to police records, four out of five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants took place.
Instead, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
The police officer Tommi Reen.
Turku Police is wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer for that.
The extent to which the city is moving around with wheels and the amount of wheels around the city may be influenced by the frequency of the events, says Teemu Ääs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise at the top of the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes very much according to which study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a completely different city, where urban centres are distant, and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary means of movement, ” Reen says.
In January to October, the whole of Finland police information has become slightly less bicycle theft than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline of recent years, the police will be informed of just over 20,000 bicycle thefts a year.
It means 50-60 filters every day and only in Helsinki about 4 000 bikes a year.
- They're big amounts, Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a crime of wheelchair theft, although less than one in ten cases notified to the police.
Typically, a bicycle theft is where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in blood.
In the case of other studies, when, for example, stolen wheels can be found in a drug case, Reen explains.
In Helsinki, bike thieves will be caught weekly by themselves or by police, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
For example, he said that the wheels are stolen from the wheelchairs, courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs of commercial centres, or virtually everywhere they are normally stored.
Most of the individual wheel models are stolen, just like the years before, Jopos.
The U lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some steal a bike for short-term use, for example, but much of the stolen wheels end up on sale, e.g. via the Internet.
They're gonna stay on the domestic market.
At least it hasn't come to the police's attention that stolen wheels are going very much abroad,\" Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
I'm sure some of them buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some might have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike should be careful because he may be guilty of a hide-and-seek offence or offence.
- The bells should play, if they sell their jugular bikes, - Reen says.
Special Library official Severi Hirv always wears the colourful Nopsa for his working day to protect the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He's had five pieces, but none of them have been stolen, Hirvi says.
Perhaps this isn't so attractive to thieves, this may not even have a hipster value, the Helsinkiman Hirv might wonder.
Siiri Valve, who worked at the Kallio in Helsinki, quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the wheel turned up against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his wheels on something solid, like a wheelchair.
There will be quite a lot to consider, for this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own, the Helsinki student says about his white bike, which the body alone cost about five hundred euros.
\"All the time, my friends will hear that the wheels have been taken.
- Mostly bad wheels, such dirty guys...
A bike was stolen from the guard in the inner yard of the house company a year ago.
Although the wheel had not been locked, the guard was able to wait for it to be brought.
Under 15 years of age in charge of his crimes?
Helsinki is testing comparison crews familiar to the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-fed team is being tried to prevent young people from entering the crime cycle.
The initial trial is applied to persons under 15 years of age who are now under criminal responsibility.
A bloodball crew is missing the first young to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer jury is discussing what happened with the offender and imposing a penalty.
A week later, the offender may himself join the peer-false crew to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has come to be done and what has been learned from it.
The youth director, Tommi Laitio, tells me that the model is not tight.
We also have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
\"All of them will guide young people's activities in a more responsible direction, so that not all will go wrong with the first mistake,\" says the Department.
A model has been taken into the comparison team from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crimes, young people do not have to face the adult panel but reflect on what happened with people of about the same age.
The model's been tried once.
The Service Design Office, which followed the trial, Palmu service designer Iikka Lovio, reports that this was an abuse that was successfully resolved.
Especially the first crimes of people under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
It's been a message that you keep on the path you've chosen, Lovio says.
The Vertaisavalamény is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
The logo underlines that new ways of action are offered to all who need it, not just to immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft from it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money transferred to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
\"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his recklessness, incompetentness and record disadvantages, threaten to bring to these elections a voice call,\" says Politico.
Only the direct direction of all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in Trump's decorative anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning presidential elections are falling by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the members of the letter’s organization is clearly the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes the Trumps.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from people who want to protect the majority of the parties in Congress, and that it is not for anyone to support.
The letter lists a number of actions by Donald Trump, who are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authorityal tendencies.
Earlier this week 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton's permission to facilitate the US's families with children
In the United States, Democratic President-designate Hillary Clinton reported on the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president so that the U.S. economy can go well for everyone.
\"Donald Trump's trying to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends,\" Clinton said in his speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve the U.S. infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by rich tax increases, in part by private money.
The program is hand-held to the American duunares who suffer from the conversion of factories to the land of cheap work.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he also sounded like Sanders to stress that rich people should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company goes from the United States to tax, it'll have to pay off the tax, Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
As a President, I object to all trade agreements that operate against employees or wages, and Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published in The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was planning to criticise the financial program published by Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it would recommend only these kinds of millions of people.
As regards the reduction in corporate taxes proposed by Trump, Clinton has previously called \"Trump's loopholes\".
Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneurs himself.
He reminded hearers of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
If he wants to make America great again, he should start making his own products in America, and Clinton would do it.
These include Rio's viewers: Kisats have not glued Finns to the edge of the squares, but the mobile application is interested
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics on sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached the peak of viewers.
At one time, the races have been glued to the top of the squares by 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night swims followed by Ylen Olympic TV2 at the same time by 615 000 viewers.
Because of comparison: one month ago, the general sports EM contests received nearly 800 000 viewers at the same time as TV2, and the football EM competitions were quite another million.
The Olympics have so far been most interested in the Sunday night biking and the fifth day of the race opened the telinejítításe, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers at the same time.
Yle Sport Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures and reminds us that the viewers are distributed in Rio Olympics for the first time in several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers are elected by the Olympics.
In addition to television, TV2 and Yle Fem channels are distributed.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competition Yle has dedicated the whole channel to.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London competitions or in the 2008 Beijing competitions, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s race broadcasts will come to nighttime in Finland.
Another reason for his dilute interest - if one of them is found to be thin now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some kind of surprise medal out of the initial competitions, the interest would have come up with it.
In addition, sport is just beginning, as are other Finnish interesting species: sailing and horse riding.
At first, according to Pokkinen, the number of viewers has been near expected.
When the sports starts, the audiences explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the race at the Apple App Store for the most downloadable free app.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're already on the road to 200,000 downloads.
- We'll only get the numbers on the network later,\" says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked on all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
Rio Areena has been associated with delay and other small technical problems in the initial phase.
Applications have been updated to correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are seen in Ylen channels and arenas more widely than any other sports event ever before.
You can follow some species from Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Kee is passing the race daily.
Olympics are not only working animals to Yle ever, but the last ones you can follow from Ylen channels only.
Since 2018, Olympic sports will be seen both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is your sun, with a depth of 95,3 metres on the Ristinsel.
It could be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical shuttle trainer, found a weight of about 20 square feet [20 sq m] from the Cross-Ristise, the bottom of which the dive computer showed a depth of 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to insure the observation by waiving.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 metres, says the development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Over 80 metres away from Saimaa, Toisvesi and Lake Capital.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sunshine.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
There might well be some unidentified depths. Kannela would wonder.
If the deepest lake is defined using the medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In view of this, your sun will not enter into the ten deepest groups, and Suvasvez is still further away from the top.
Correction on 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: The last paragraph corrected, where the deepst lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Inhospital tax base: Pension tax is becoming more and more intense
The taxation of pensioners is becoming more severe than that of employees.
According to Ihalainen, the situation was raised under parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal compared to employees.
This is not part of the government's presentation.
We believe that it should definitely be in it.
The promises made should be kept in line after the election, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received a reduction in their income, which reduced taxation.
In the Parliament, the case increased the representatives of the opposition, which shriveled from the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (cok.) of electoral promises.
The purchasing power will be secured, it won't grow.
In line presented by Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpon (kok.) on tax reductions is, according to Ihalainen, mainly about safeguarding purchasing power and not increasing, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax reductions have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Orpo's messages with the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with difficulty.
He says that holding on to the treaty is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It needs to be done because the economy has so much domestic demand and people's own confidence in the future.
Long-term unemployment
It calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of raising the employment rate will be to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social fall.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in Thailand's attacks
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy calls on the Finnish people in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
After all, Finnish tourists intending to Thailand have no reason to withdraw because of the explosions, but the instructions of the embassy should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
Thailand with very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for one year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook following bomb attacks.
The Embassy has tried to target Finns, especially in Hua Hin, to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the factor
According to Westphalen, there's no information yet on the cause of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that events may be related to the political unrest of the Thai divided society and to the last week's referendum on the Constitution for a military junta.
The Act was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, the ethnic and ethnic conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, no attacks have been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
He said that the town celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very little.
The impact of the impact on the day’s course of action is that the authorities are extremely careful in terms of safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are local sabotage, and they're different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also excluded, reports Thailand's police news office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the 24 hours since 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourist's favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a popular tourist destination, too, four bombs exploded at Phuket at night, reports Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death.
Two bombs, according to the magazine, exploded in the hands of the across the city.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nguyen, where one person, according to the magazine, was wounded.
In the popular tourist destination, Hua Hin, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
In both double bombings, at least one died.
In addition, in South Thailand, Deaths in Than village and the city of Trang exploded at least one bomb.
At least one person died in both attacks.
The Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, for it is the way to travel to the resorts of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The factor in the impact is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military junta that controls Thailand is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't panic more people, he said to the reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told the Thai BSB that the agents were meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks had occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
After all, there is no reason for the Finns who are going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of the explosions, but it is recommended that the large-scale instructions be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
In wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
From last night's attack in Hua Hin, we have time to get some more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's second attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of a bell tower known to be visible.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin from which it believes it has found another bomb.
The dead Than bomb was hidden in a flower cap according to the governor of the county.
In the impact, the municipal employee died.
There's at least one wounded.
According to the officer interviewed by CNN, two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded approximately half an hour ago.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Bales won women's four matches
The US Alexandra Raisman was second point 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third score of 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, reaching Rio's race for more Teline Championships on the perman, jump and boom.
Biles has had control of women's gymnastics in mind over the past few years.
For the last three years, he has eight personal World Championships.
He's won three times in a row and a boom last year and another year.
The United States team, Bales, has reached two teams' World Championships.
Biles got jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: \"The person has no influence on tourism\"
Esa Huovila, who runs a playground in Phuket, Thailand and the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think that anything more amazing will come about, estimated Huovila as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for some twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of tragedy in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First was tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
I don't think this is what it's like. If these past tourists haven't banished tourists, I don't think so either.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the site of explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said that you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street of Bangladesh Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at around 10 o’clock in local time.
Many had not even heard of attacks on the beach.
At about half a day, Thailand had traffic normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been rather small, says Huovila, who visited the scene.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupy on the Jouxholm road.
When the police got there, they set the car on fire.
The party found two men matching the symbols hidden in a nearby hexagon.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and causing serious damage to the engine vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director of Russian leadership changes: Clear removal
On Friday, a high-ranking change of leadership was made in Russia, when President Vladimir Putin separated the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian-style, 44-year-old Anton Vayo.
He's an ex-diplomat. He worked for Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason why Ivanov's separation can be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling of management tasks is one of the ways in which power is being used.
This is a way of preventing people from asking themselves the President's independent power.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been congested or screwed by other leaders.
Ascension of Ivanoville
Ivanov, within the Putin, will be transferred to the specific tasks of environmental and transport matters.
On a tape from the state media, Putin said that it was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and suggested that Vao be replaced, told Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear loss of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's priorities.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russia's power.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the President's Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin at KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnöniem, from the Foreign Policy Institute, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place, that Putin is becoming younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they withdrew in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape into the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, the Arabs and the Kurdishs received around 90% of the important Manbij city of Isis.
However, it is estimated that tens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
The repaired news earlier at 19:30: In the past, we mistook the fact that civilians were fleeing the city, the really Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: Independence of the Ministry of Interior document release line
The guidelines of the Ministry of Interior on the publication of documents are illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells the STT that the public cannot base the document on the Authority’s own guidelines, but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of Interior refused to give up the list of participants in the Ministry of Interior events to East Sanomim.
The Minister gave reasons for the decision by the Government Secretary's instructions and the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's communication director tells the STT that there is a need to reform practices at the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt's been fighting back for a while.
From the beginning, he hurt his way back and had to pass on the Olympic maps of Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I'm much better at it.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small-scale champagne dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt is surrounded by the fact that the Jamaican star has risen during the era when sport has been struggling with doping scandals and suffocating interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympics came to Athens in 2004, when he was cut off in the 200 - foot [200 m] opening time on 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that they slowed down your injuries and loosened your training position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began by a hundred meters, in which he crushed the world record and the confidence of competitors during the time of 9,69, despite the end of the celebration.
This is harder.
A year later, in Berlin's World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the end of his career at the clock.
World records born in Berlin are still valid at 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 in two hundred.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his pursuit of a 200-metre world record and a substation of 19 seconds, but no one else believes in it but Bolt himself.
The challenger of the Satasella Bolt is Justin Gatlin, the 100th Olympic winner of Athens 2004.
Last year in Beijing's MM-final, Bolt lost the American with only one hundred-seconds.
Bolt has not lost in the finals of the prize competitions during his reign that began in Beijing, if only he has made his way.
In Daegus in 2011 the MM-final remained without running from Bolt because of the flash-off.
Bolt fills up in a lot of weeks, 30.
He's an old man in the type of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The last goal of the career, Bolt has set up next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest of them.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the lower world, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.
Disseminations from Rio: Two athletes suspected of a doping crisis
According to Xinhua, China’s National News Office, Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive drug sample at Rio Olympics.
There were traces of banned substances in the doping sample of China’s Sire Chen Xiny.
Also, the Bulgarian drinks Silvia Danekova is suspected of a doping crisis.
In addition, the Chinese general sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample with signs of epo hormoneone.
He was placed in Rio in the fourth place in women's butterfly showers of 100 metres.
According to Estao, the Brazilian newspaper has taken its doping cases before the International Court of Appeal (CAS).
Xinhua says that the sample of Xiny's Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping episodes have also been shown in Rio.
The BBC reported that the Bulgarian women's drinks Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample with signs of epo-hormon.
Kenya has, for its part, transferred the public sports coach from Rio to the home of the public sports coach because of the doping thing.
On Thursday, the International Olympics Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had become a athlete at the time of the test and had given the doping sample for this.
According to the media data, this is John Anzrah, a Chinese quick drink coach.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of a 800-metre runner called Ferguson Rotich.
There's no stopping the Phelps - the historical gold came into the display style
The most successful athlete in Olympia history, Michael Phelps, U.S.A., was able to win his 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' payout was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in the confusion before Wang Shun in China.
I'm just trying to have some fun. I'm just trying to have a BBC Olympic Commander Helen Skelton laughs at a quick interview in the afternoon.
Helen Skelton (albeit) on Monday, the case is much more detailed this week on the website of the evening magazine.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if there is a small noise in the media or in the British press about his exposed and special costumes.
The TV's a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton has dressed in high-pitched shoes and shorts in a dress with at least enough openness to the eyes of many conservative British warriors.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and the little noises are just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be a little agitated and perhaps agitated, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
Here we are watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress up.
Can you imagine that the juice has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that points to how hard these swimmers do work, and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton's rolling.
You know what?
It's for nothing if it comes from wearing (the driver).
I'm just a little amused to have this kind of thing hit somebody's radar.
Rio's police committed two arrests for acts of terrorism.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that it has arrested two people for terrorist acts.
The police made arrests in connection with the security oversight of the race.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.

The Argentinian lady dressed Petija-Siren - Finnish thought of protest
The wind in Petajaj-Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The wind in Petija-Sire went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady dressed Tuuli Petija-Siren on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day in Rio.
There was a clear breach of the wind.
The opponent admitted a violation.
Because of the crash, he got stuck, and the others ran away, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing that, because, according to the Olympic rules, it would have been useless.
I should have dropped in the water to get a refund, Petajaur-Siren said.
The Finnish was hanging on his board until the last time, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
Suomalainen left her place 27 with a crash.
In the overall situation, London’s 2012 Olympic hop pool is the eighth.
The accident didn't seem to have much effect on him.
Friday is an important day when the race starts at 10-12.
Modified 0.39: By way of derogation from the first information, Petajaj-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Matters which, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between Earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring further years to a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
At times, things that can't be influenced by a person can bring him more years.
These include, among other things, a tendency towards mid-life or social status.
Regular shopping can extend age.
You don't always have to hit me. Just apply for a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought by many different studies.
Medical Daily introduced seven strange results.
According to science, all these things may lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against certain cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.
The University of Harvard survey found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of death, particularly in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, there are once again studies that suggest that using it for one of three days could extend life.
For example, one noticed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of the toothpaste can extend the life of a person for up to six years, says a study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation of the gum.
They can, on the other hand, contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
The survey in Norway explained how laughter affected man’s lifetime.
The seven-year project observed over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when sexual diseases are taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition to everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, it's just not enough to have sex as such.
In order for a person to receive further years of his life, he should also receive orgasm.
Traffic, of course, brings further years, and there is no denying it.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute legal certainty.
One study by Oxford University found that women with a big buttock had lower cholesterol levels.
Their bodies also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it was an actor who won the Olympic medal, or Oscar, he was more likely to live longer than a regular bulldozer.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings further years of his life.
On the other hand, some researchers suspect that a long time ago is due to a person's social status - which, for example, allows the pursuit of confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping daily, probably less likely to make a shopping parent.
This is due to the fact that in concrete shops rotation reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
So let's count your credit card with your hand, the online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Umpihulainen driver's drink fell toward the truck.
A serious truck and passenger car pickup cave took place on Friday night in Koskke, real-time.
The accident occurred in Koskella, between Koskentien and Sorvastoti on Friday at 2 p.m.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa when the passenger car that had come to Forssa had drifted onto the same lane, hit the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was standing up, but it started burning.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car slipped through the fence and from there over the door to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car remained in her car.
The rescue facility disembarked the injured driver from his car and was transported to the treatment of the University Hospital of Turku.
The result of a woman's blow test was 2.02 prom.
He's suspected of having a serious bike drink.
The mail sent her to the wrong town.
There were deficiencies in Salon K-Citymarket's loose deck selection because the mail had delivered some of the load accidentally to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, living in Pernio, was on Thursday, buying clothes from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the loose, because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
So if there's no congestion in a lawn stick, it's locked in a sign.
The sticky sign of the shop is related to the fact that the Posti extended its services last spring to include lawn cutting.
The food sandwich is available at the Post offer until the end of August.
In his opinion, the sign was mainly amusing and he decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with an abstinence.
Also, media representatives have been calling all the time, and this is an incredible observation, Haltia wonders.
Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia had her favorites caught in a bag of loose sheets, even though a couple of camps were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesio, responsible for the business of the Post Transport Services, regretted the damage to East Sannom.
The background is that three of the five stages were misinterpreted yesterday (Seinajoki) and three of us no longer went to do part-delivery (Saloon) but only five staged today, Kaidesoo told East Sanom.
It was the first news of the evening Sanomas.
Teija Halt wasn't upset about the sign because she found a selection of all her own iron arch favorites.

The wish of a woman murdered in Lovis: Remembering the victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, the 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovisa hopes that the victim would be remembered for the benefit of a police dog instead of flowers and addressees.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published an Facebook update that gives the victim's family a wish for contributions to police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had done a job as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinary Centre and had also completed a nurse's training there.
The veterinary station remembers the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, humorful and unafraided.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred to.
The update refers to the fact that donations are made to police dogs as a whole, primarily to the acquisition of security vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old housewife was murdered in her own yard in Lovisha Koskenkylä.
The women's neighbors have told the evening magazine the victim has been very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman, and they had no connection with each other.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog named Börje, who was wounded life-threatening in an arrest situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Post a judgment on the infringement of the Act of Equality
The post did not have the right to arrest the salary of the employee who refused to study the agency, assessed the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court obligated Post to pay most of the salary arrested to the employee and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a portion of the supervisor’s salary, which was responsible for the proportion of the study for the whole day’s work.
According to the District Court, workers had been placed in a more favourable position, in violation of the Equality Act, on the basis of their trade union activities.
The staff member had complied with the Union's organisational decision in the field of postal and logistics on the ban on supervision.
During the Post Office of November last year PAU adopted a decision that Post workers will not be familiar with temporary workers who break strike.
The first thing that happened was the People's News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights

Putin fired the head of his administration from the Estonian-style Vauno
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned the Head of Presidential Administration, Sergei Ivanov, Kreml.
Karl Vayo's grandson Anton Vayo, head of the Soviet-Viro Communist Party, will be present.
It is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
According to the Kreml report, Ivanov, which is part of the close internal context of Putin, is transferred to the specific tasks of environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and suggested that Vaoto be replaced, Russian Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in a spying KGB.
Many considered Ivanov possible as Putin’s successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2012 before Putin re-election in 2012.
The BBC: Manu's giant buy-out to the game ban won't be seen in the opening of Valoligan.
The world record man for football transfers will not be seen in the field when the British Valolit is kicked off during the weekend.
Paul Pogba's no-play ban followed England.
The Manchester United’s giant acquisition of Paul Pogba is on the side of the game because of the ban on the opening of the ManU’s league against Bournemouth on Sunday, reported the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society Juventus paid EUR 105 million from Pogba.
However, the UK football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, for Pogba was left to the Juventus to be held under a no-game ban.
He received two warnings from last season's Italian cup, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba’s next seam to play is the league in the second round on August 19th, when ManU meets the Southampton.
Flow's big-time madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event, marked by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival walkers have typically expressed themselves in their own personal clothing.
One of the main artists is this year's punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is stagnated, including artificial grass and art gymnastics.
It has never been enough for us to have just a headgear and a beer, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in the Summer Gulf of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to dozens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind the success is simple: What kind of event would the authors like to go?
There's a little bit of a difference in events that we're thinking about.
Often the aim is to achieve the level of necessity and operate in accordance with the rules of authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event, that Flow would be sold again this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of visitors with 5,000 people last year.
This year, a group of interesting Finnish and foreign artists will be seen.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point mass would be like a herd that is controlled by a huge route.
That's not what we want.
Over the 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been highlighted in such a way that there are 130 performers, art theatres and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main and smaller platforms, this year, the tent of 15,000 people operates as a jobplace.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more easily.
Maybe I'm a little bit of a big deal, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to the Rock is that even today, great visions are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of around EUR 20 000.
Last year the company’s net sales to Flow were around EUR 6 million.
It's a way to make-and-creise stuff, like building that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own personal clothing.
In addition to the music event, the community of trendy young adults can be discussed.
However, this event has not deliberately been profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to break up with content, first and foremost.
Yet fashion phenomena are also suitable for Flow's world of values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is a red legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rappies, and soul-combing festivals that he's not the most typical performer.
According to Kallio, Iggy was bullied because now is probably the last time this is seen on a job in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what they call on commercial radio.
Iggy's last record is damn good and he's been doing a hell of a good job in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist parasitic bombs were hidden in the flower pots... the tourists fled in their terrors.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs had been hidden in a flowerpot and blew up with cell phones.
Bombs were placed on a street, most of which are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, reported a police representative named Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, the wild animal protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, wrote a plagiarising picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can look at it from here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and told me the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It happened in one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs at Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, even by favoring the Finnishs on the island of Phuket, two bombs exploded.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, Hua Hin had a second double bomb shot.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they had discovered at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had yet to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel troops behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the operations of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken over the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new forces will go into battle in a war situation first
In an acute military situation, the military officers are told to do battle tasks only after several months of taking a military oath, says the Central Finnishman.
According to Chief of Defence Training, Brigade General Jukka Sonninen, who has been interviewed by the newspaper, in a military situation of, for example, 5.5 months, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for battle.
According to the head of training, first the reserve members of the teams are assigned to the service.
No backup or reserve member shall be ordered to carry out a mission for which no required training has been carried out, Sonninen says.
Previously in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are taking up the training of backup personnel for immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military activities already during military training.
Pamela Tola's been paid for the home house.
The actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, Pauli Waroma, have won a hard fight from the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The trading price of a two-stored single house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused a dangerous microbial growth rate for health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in its condition in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price discount from the seller there.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both cutting and homicidal law.
The court gave judgment on Wednesday.
It was in force in a judgment of the District Court ordering the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the trial and clearing expenses of the couple.
The right to a slightly lower price, since some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the purchasers when it was trading in housing.
However, according to court law, the manifest building errors were essentially more serious than what was presented.
Tola was looking for a home of goodwill.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought the home of goodwill because they did not want to take up repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the aspects mentioned in the Health Check Report were not harmed.
The Health Check Report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rainwaters and melting water that flow along rock learning.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma felt that rainwater from the rock might have to be driven a little over a few years.
The goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the dwelling were much more serious than they thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed that microbes are due to both rock rainwater and capillary soil pollution.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated by the microbes, according to the inspector’s assessment, was also able to enter the indoor area as well.
Healthy risk, limit values across mold or yeast were found in the brush samples in the homeroom, the basement stairs, the living room window box and the basement washroom.
Steels were built without permits.
The court also contested whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The Court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make illegal changes to the housing.
Among other things, terraces were built even though there were no adequate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in law.
According to the court, the purchasers could assume from the seller before they were sold that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was not a need for measuring repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that there was no specific reason to carry out a wider routine inspection.
The purchasers have not neglected their reporting obligations; the court states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - also Finns in the register
The journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article on how documents recorded in the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., have been recorded on microfilms, covering a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi bridesmaid.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi German breed agency.
The department was acting under the leadership of SS director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
Andersson stated that gynaecological studies were carried out in women to investigate the matter.
The racial office examined women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The aim was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and to give the breed agency the lives written and good recommendations from close relatives.
The department wanted to guarantee that women were very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very good national socialists who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bridesmaid of SS men.
The story does not tell us how 14 Finnish women found in the archives documents went to the end of the story.
The SS directors created a programme supported by the State, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that each SS man should have four children, either married or outside.
Lebensborn homes care for children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, reports on the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for access to children.
The German mother’s honoraryist was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and the non-Aryans were legally prohibited, the museum's pages are stated.

Jari Sillanpää's satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours at night:
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for more than 20 years.
From the cruise ship’s barmaid to the 1995 tango kun, the most sold solo artist in Finland, and the Sillanpää jacket, as stared by dancers and painters, continues to smother and he is now in a gloomy climb.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppenen, was published on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The career of Sillanpää rose to a total rise in his victory in the Tangong King’s crown on the Tango market in 1995.
At the contest Sillanpää sang tangos, but she had already planned some different music for herself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tango piece to Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen agreed to a slightly different form.
The satulinna piece thus became one of the most popular pieces of Finnish music history.
The book states that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so dressed!
The silkhead remembers in the book.
You wouldn't think it'd be in the hang of singing it in a hangover.
Although I wasn't physically my best, it was still good.
I learned that all the time, you don't have to insist on yourself being perfect and top.
Another incident related to the most popular copies of the man, which the book says, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanpää resigned from her partner then, and the case ended up with you earning gold in texts published as singles in 2014.
The book says that Sarah’s songs ordered from the Cove were not the same as Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a story about his own life, but the words of a song about the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 days.
In the newspaper’s news, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loved one was told about Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol use, but Jar said that it was full of pubs and was not true.
Jari called the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it, and good.
In June, the British surprised themselves, too, by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the polls for the voting week anticipated the opposite result.
British ecosystems and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the difference, although a couple of individual researchers could disagree with the power flow of their profession.
On the basis of Western politics, the former President of the United States Bill Clinton's election campaign, It's the economy, the seats, flew to the ruin in the British Brexit vote.
The Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy seemed not to be the most important policy issue.
The Economic Scrutiny
Centre for Macro-conomics tiva in the latest month's survey of professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economies were not listened to because this time the voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of the economic loss of economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, and that is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many also have the idea that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe in economic arguments because the consensus of the Economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, the BBC’s equity was reduced, which only provided a small proportion of the EU’s economic scientists with a difference of eco-nomics compared to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested to tell what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE think about the consequences of the difference.
These remote combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if economimist messages were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because economists represent an elite with which voters do not share common interests.
The academics such as economist cities would have remained in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Immigration, too, is an economy
The overwhelming argument of the Brexit vote on immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant rushes your hospital, an immigrant uses you for it.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical time if they weren't?
There are children of immigrants in every school.
How much easier would the children of the right British get a place of school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the protagonists have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists failed to answer them and, if they did succeed, their answers did not get any visibility.
Economists failed to explain that the British have more jobs thanks to immigrants, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU migrants - are the net contributors of the British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund reserved for Brex in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments corresponded to the Finnish Pertti Olden.
According to him, in Aberdeen, early Brexit was prepared by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the camp in favour of the EU difference, began to be prepared more than a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be high.
It took care that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When the Brexi took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, the old man says about Aberdeen's only open day not to mention the real estate fund that the news relates to.
According to the old people, the normal value would be between 15 and 20 per cent.
At that time, the fund was worth GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is around GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest amount in the nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all British real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
So the real estate funds reserved for Brex in various strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp for the difference in the EU won, Europe went awoke.
However, the few weeks that followed the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Oldman.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by the President of the Central Bank of England, Mark Carney, where he estimates that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the Real Estate Funds first, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, these brought the situation to an end and raised the issue of the Financial Times and the BBC's main findings.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Old man.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started to spin, and after that, the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but that too had to be frozen for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close trade but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were allowed time to consider whether money should now be drawn out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take out your money now, it's not worth it because it's going to make losses.
It calmed down, and most of them cancelled the report.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very peaceful for a few weeks, says the Old One.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner-Europe funds did not have any similar upheaval.
However, there were a lot of questionnaires.
Insufficient attention to real estate funds
The older people felt that the closures of real estate funds were given disproportionate attention.
The open funds for closures account for about 4% of the British real estate.
Aberdeen's lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on half of 2017.
Today there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not appear to be more important to Aberdeen.
The biggest issues are now the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, the Old One points out.
In addition, the retail price and the dollar rate are at its lowest level for 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought mines to London Real Estate Market
Two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look so good yet.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is going over Plan B now. Old man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was on his way to work right away.
London City was already fully alive, despite the morning.
The TV screens that were normally put to the vote in the office changed the news, and usually the loud people were quiet enough to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron entered the camera in the morning to tell about the difference.
When the market opened up, the evidence ends flashed red.
It was a morning that he would never believe in, says Old Man.
It is not because, despite the mystery, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate stores on the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company had been well prepared for the alternative, and that is why the situation was kind of peaceful, says the Old One.
The Brexit vote started the correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
We've got a little bit of a crash. The British leadership's on the switch.
The market was expected to lead to a sharp fall in the British real estate market, especially in London.
In London office premises, up to 20% of the mines were expected in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
That's what Aberdeen did for six days.
Now the poison is down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
Although it did not show up on its last summer holidays on the faces of Old Man who was in Helsinki this week.
He believes it is far too early to say much about what is going on with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland responds to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already become a primary source of information.
The CBRE data of the real estate service company covers about a third of the market.
They say that the prices of all properties in London decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the negative was 6.1 per cent, and the old man lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're months of change.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, says Oldman.
All the same fall hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis which started on the US real estate market.
The old man feels that the parable is not quite valid, because it is now a British home-like crisis.
Even the atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has now not seen any panic sale like that, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says the Old One.
The financial position is also found as normal.
The repair movement could have been in front of us in any case
As a matter of fact, it's not a miracle of him that the price fixing process could have been in the face of something like this without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world cities have been too high for years.
For two years now, we have said that City and, in particular, the offices are overpriced, says Oldman.
So the fall began very high.
London's prices have written up for four reasons, Old Man's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has grown as well.
Another big trend is that properties are the last category of ownership that is globalized, says the Old One.
New entrants have entered the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate sites abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, low interest rates have been fed, making it necessary for pension companies, for example, to look for revenues from new sites.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to the old man, the debt relief has now been used considerably less than in the period prior to the crisis in 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the rise in prices settled last summer, says the Old One.
Aberdeen also began to reduce its ownership in London, and last year it was a net seller.
There was some kind of a turn to wait, and now it came.
From here on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the Old One.
He's afraid to evaluate the future, but he's saying there's hardly any lift-up.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or a steady passage ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, for he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the hole can be solved by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If you're scattered, the risks are also scattered, the Old One says.
The S-Group will start to register more information on purchases
The S Group will soon know what you are eating, because the trading group today said that it would start collecting more accurate information on the purchases of its parent customers.
By now, when data have been collected from the total amount of receipts, the group will begin to fish for the products purchased at the beginning of May.
Group S follows Kesko here, because data on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to Ismo Riga, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data shall be collected with the agreement of the customer and used in a licensed way for marketing purposes.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
A little bit of a customer has banned the use of product information, Riitala says to the House of Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the change in the registration of Group S.
Kesko is already classifying his client according to food purchases only to ten groups.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
Data is used for customer-oriented marketing.
Product-specific purchasing data are collected only from K-group's own chains.
Co-operation partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a master client program and this is not the case.
Finland's nearest shop has its own One-Bondonus customer programme, which can be associated with the Valantalos, Siwos and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect data on product or group of products, we stick to the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchase was made, and that day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level like the K-Group or the S-Group, says the commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, it is to be reformed in the future, but the Middle Trade will tell you about it later.
However, the Ora does not permit the registration of product information.
First Trial
So far, the SOK customer register has been relatively large.
In addition to personal and address data, basic information has included occupation, education, housing, birth years and previous personal data of children.
People belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and payment method have been recorded in the S-Participation.
In addition, information from S-bourners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will start to be saved in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data are currently recorded at product group level in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains.
For a longer time, customers have had the hope that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of SOK’s customer owner and partner business.
The S-Group says they're reporting a change to their customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored on cats in any case, whether it or not.
Halukas can check your stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash register cannot access the information, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila's baby is Tulli's latest dog fixation - the prophecy becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador performer's puppy is scribbling five boxes of the same country lined up at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it's firmly sitting next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio will reward his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
From the box next to Heila's seat, the jar was exposed to a bottle of seals that hit the square gas.
Ruut gas is the first smell that Heila and Heila have now been practicing, says Suntio, the owner of Heila dog.
Safety and online trade access
Heila is a dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives in Tulli, and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also be taken to other border crossings and ports when needed by Heila and Suntion.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job since the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels were caused by measures and attacks in Customs have been confirmed, says Tulli's chief inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to the duties of Customs for training arms and explosives dogs is mailing via Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet store, up to 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, among which arms and explosives may be ordered abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, the Customs has made available around 300 weapons, ammunition, ammunition, explosives and source materials related to online shopping, passenger mobile equipment and air freight.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It's going to look into recorded travel supplies and mail.
In ports it will be of great benefit in future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of Heila's performance, Customs estimates whether weapons and explosives dogs will be trained more in the future.
Grönberg's hopeful attitude to the idea.
School in the church
Heila-pennu is coordinated by the Customs Dog School, which is located in Kirkkonummi.
The Sun will also visit the police and the Defence Forces' experts in training with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and with the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide, together with other authorities, what smells Heila is taught to identify.
They are always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki Airport are Customs six drug dogs, as well as money and drug dogs Massi.
The Labradorizer Heila has been chosen from ten puppy cubs.
The selection criteria for the dog to choose at the airport include tearing and hunting, as well as peace, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close friend to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila for one-off stand.
The night-to-day cameraman will lose the camera's mask to the fast dog, but Heila will return the soft toy-like shield from the speed-hound.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's initial training is due next year.
The next level tests will be carried out in October, which will assess whether or not education is sufficient for the work to be carried out.
Heila can be seen at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the working vest on the dog, reminds us of Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is around EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Workdays can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours can only last from 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of working dogs is a hard competition in Customs.
Heila owns about 20-30 Tulli employees.
The happiness hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Customs.
The mini-state got its first Olympic medal - the people get the day off.
With less than a million inhabitants, the Fiji Olympics in rugby are valued in the country so high that the government has appointed the 22th day of August for a national holiday.
According to the land broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the issue after the championship was settled.
We'll have the day off to take the team home the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by the final in the capital city of Suva, where the stadium had a screen set up.
Normally, only the naive Fijins are interested in rugby, but this game linked our cultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said the Fiji Times journalist to Maigle Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish singer passed out after the wild performance
During his last attempt, a weighttaker, Milko Tokola, managed from 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the rises of the wrists, he has been fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola produced 175 kilos and 145 kilos of pressure.
His joint score was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his job on his last 175 kilos, just like the other one.
The third company’s weight increased as a result of the loud screaming.
The body of the body would drop under the pressure until the judge accepted the lift.
The joy of a Finnish teacher was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired an Estonian breeder Prosan - Vegetative Liiga - East Sanomas
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays the men's football league, has concluded a lasting agreement with the Estonian champion Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a top player in our team with power and a threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With over ten players, we went through over 50 players from all over the world.
A good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, reported in the newsletter, began to break down the small seal.
Prosa, 25, arrive at the RoPS from the tallest Flora where he made a total of 51 goals at 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian National Team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Seinäjoki River, where the Rovanie bees meet the master SJK in Finland.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, the secular king of last season moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family Star is once again in line: The teenage shorts reveal almost everything.
Ariel Winter, well known as Alex Dunphyna of the Modern Family series, is again raping by presenting her proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts, which do not leave much imagination available.
The Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently paid attention by making its style and behavior much more courageous.
The star has posed in his social media images in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very limited costumes.
Winter, on the threshold of eternity, has recently published several photos of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Previously this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed her film so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had been undergoing a kind of Hollywood-style transformation from child star to adult.
He's been on television for almost his whole life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more show surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood receives, Palmer says Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has lost some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not hard to guess where he will be in ten years from now, when the lowland is already about as hard, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
Instead, some of the women's fans defend the actor and invites him not to give a damn about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what people say.
You're inspiration for a lot of women, you're a young woman.
Japanese people prefer to go to Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are being lured into the northern regions: it is possible to see the fall of a stormed storm Aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the renovations for the beginning, says Visit Finland in the press.
Inari and Levi are the main points of the Japanese northern tourism.
The northern lights are the armour cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly connected to the winter and beautiful landscapes.
In the winters of Lapland, we have a very high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the reviving season begins early in the autumn and continues to be long in the spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called \"meror aurora\", where the lake's surface reflects the northern lights from the vision of making two stories random, explains the report Visit Finland see the marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main target groups of the Visit Finland Revontuli campaign are the wealthy Japanese women aged 25 to 35, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers at Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has exceptionally strong and positive landscapes among Japanese people compared to other Nordics.
However, the Japanese would like more unique attractions in Finland and, according to Lind, there is a huge potential for these revocules.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists have grown considerably more than other Nordics in Finland.
Last year they spent more than double their night in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finland as a target group for tourism because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain is satisfied with leading the master class organized by Rugbyhopeaan Fidi to gold
The impressive progress of Britain in the rugby tournament collapsed Fidz's last challenge at the Thursday night final when the team experienced the 437/7 crackdown at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged a master's class for reading, bites, walkies, play games, running pins and silk when they won gold - their first Olympic medal.
The death came with a reasonable comfort from the third day of the silver medal - Britain - and they could be proud of their hard work in the Olympic Rugby tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa.
In the past, a hard 7-5 victory of the semi-final played on the same day in South Africa may have bothered them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top 15-person team in this state.
Great Britain may, but probably not, be comforted by the fact that at least one Britishman will have a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, former British boss Wimbledon.
Great Britain's trip has been quite a while.
Eight years ago they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament, trained by Ryan.
This is where they lost only one.
This is going to happen in the back of the sauna, but it's a start.
Fidi started an excellent fight against the British tabloids for fun.
With Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they've been running busses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the target area in the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great coat stopped the male mountain Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it was only slow for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made a paint at the right angle, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa made another goal for a new start, and the clock still had more than a minute...first half time.
After that, Vatemo Ravovuou collided through the British found bars and rushed the line to make a goal.
After the landing, the situation at the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was only teaching the game.
And that's what it really is.
The United Kingdom made a break by a block of changes that blocked the Fidi dam... for a total of four minutes, which compared to the first half was good until Joshua Tuisova set the goal after Fid's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton caught a goal for Britain in the left corner of Touchdown and narrowing the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waving flags and dancing at the viewers.
It was hard not to admire Fid's positive approach.
Mata Vilime's last-minute goal was to have a cold in Fidi's cake, which didn't need any watering.
The pilot was rushed, the feds hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely hit.
Previously, Fidi had hit Japan in the semi-final 20-5, and the United Kingdom won South Africa in a tight semi-final, where both made one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took the South African lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with a dazzling footwork and made a goal under the paintballs in the second half.
It's a great late hit from Marcus Watson, the brother of the 15-year-old Rugby team in England, guaranteed victory, and finally a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to the war.
In these races there will be no more difficult gold than feeling, and it really means something.
From the first draw to the last 220 heavy race towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment in Estacio da Lago.
While they were rowing alone, there were three votes on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was all the time, while the two of his second consecutive Olympics were in the women's double race - the first women in the British sports history books that reached such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also recordable.
This is what we see, two great athletes joining the surface with the sweetness of the spring, not entirely reflecting the character of winning.
There is a group of helpful handicrafts behind each row that gradually promote those things that matter, and no handicrafts were as essential as a coach who didn't know about the cancer diagnosis 30 months ago whether he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was a mess.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
It could've been pretty bad.
It's gonna change your thinking a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third one was lucky that his treatment could be started outside the period early 2014, when they caused as little interference as possible - if this expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital walking around the department... 20, 30, 50 feet at a time... when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
The rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after victory, the first couple of thoughts were Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little bit more about trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Afghan commando from the royal artillery, said: “I have been a tunnel ruin this week, which may be a little overreacted, but this means so much to me...
It just stresses how important this is to me, how much I and Helen, and Robin, too, we have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he's very grateful. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost competition in five years.
A couple set up a tough rhythm that their competitors couldn't meet.
Even on the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and the Danish teams started approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very attached in the moment.
Helen yelled at the process, stay in the process.
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we tried to do nothing special.
We didn't look for fireworks today. We're just trying to win a good row and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple wait a year before you decide your future.
Glover's gonna be at the wedding next month when he's getting married to a TV adventurer named Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on him.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was so stressed.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better, he said.
Iceland is changing the corrupt government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which have already been called for by the protestors who have been pissed off by Panama databases in the spring.
So-called Panama paper revealed tax evasion by a number of Icelandic politicians.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protestors.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannson, promised to organise new parliamentary elections in autumn at that time.
The election has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last year's rage affects the autumn election.
In June, the presidential elections saw a clear picture of criticism of the power-driven people, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been elected president on the outside of the policy, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
The US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cancelled his latest speech.
He said he was sarcastically claiming that President Barack Obama would be the founder and candidate for democracy of the terrorist organization Isis for the establishment of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was angry with what he said and demanded an apology from Trump.
The army chief should never let anyone fall down like that, Clinton's receipt.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the burkin’s bathing suit, which is popular for Muslims, on the bathing beaches, reports, among other things, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that bathing on beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a good manner and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing costumes, which are largely expressing religious ties, may increase the risk of confusion in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove French national day to the party crowd.
At the end of July, two extreme organizations in Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of bathing water in Oulu passed through the wall - Blue samber in the lake Piykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue whiting has been observed on the bathing area of Lake Piykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesdays, Oulu’s environmental activities took water samples from nine EU shores and 30 other common bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, all concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococciform bacteria in bathing waters were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
Water E.coli and entero-cocaine concentrations were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The surface of the lake of fishing does not yet make the bathing area unsaponifiable, but under favourable conditions the situation may quickly turn into a blue-grain bed, making the surface of the water a blue-green bed of rest.
Environmental action follows the situation with increased controls.
If the sinusine seine is transformed into a blue whirlpool, the bathing areas shall also be reported separately on the reporting table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
M.T.M.K.: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest reduction is one tax change in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation of the forest holding.
The Ministry of Finance has four objectives: promoting generation exchanges of forest holdings, increasing the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of the forest holding and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote an entrepreneurial forestry industry.
A hunter would reduce the clean capital result of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool that promotes the generation of forest holdings is good, commenting to the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK) Director of Forestry Juha Hakkarainen.
It is, however, astounding to find a critical proposal for a tax change.
Forest reduction is set out as a function of the clean capital result of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
In the opinion of the OCT and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales of the tree.
The VM proposal is based on a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry by preventing the loss of the income of forestry, which should be reduced in other taxes.
This kind of person would get tax benefits even if he didn't sell wood.
The model of calculation is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out. Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model applies to only a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit for forest yield is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the reduction.
The model would have an impact of around 10% of the forest ownership division, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the holding.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been carried out for decades according to Hajorainen.
Its background is the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MEK, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years, and around half of forest owners are retired.
The powerful rake of rage surprised the drivers in Himanga - two cars were smothered into each other and bumped into each other.
Himanga, the Kalajoki River, had a special chase on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two consecutive times were subdued into the stream, after which the car came running after the driver.
According to the sunfriend fireman, Harri Pühtiääää, the defamation of the stream is suspected of having been caused by a powerful rage.
In the back of the car, there were two people who were both transported to hospital.
There's no more accurate knowledge of their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove before was not injured.
The accident occurred on highway 8 Himanga a few kilometers from Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings of Professor Johanna Ivaska's study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the incidence of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as chest tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in this environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by returning the cancer surrounding tissue to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results have been published in Nature Communications on 4 August.
There's no reason why we can't get to the hospital.
The cleaning of the musketeer’s household’s death continues in court for both convicted persons.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for family deaths in Muhoos.
The other received 8 years for 4 months from killing and gross robbery, among other things as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment as a young person for murder and gross robbery.
The victim was also sentenced to a serious risk of road safety as a young person and to the driving of a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who was sentenced to a more severe sentence.
The prosecution calls for a less punished man to be convicted of a murder committed as a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
They were at the time of the act in full understanding
According to the District Court, 17-year-olds killed a man who was a director of the child protection department at the schoolhouse in July of last year.
The 17-year-old intimidation, according to the reasoning of the judgment, attacked a conductor sitting on the couch of the living room.
The director had gotten rid of him and tolerated the young man in his room, when one of the young men hit him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the director was strangled under the chair, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a mental study, both those who were convicted were at the time of the act fully understood.
According to the law, young people had been planning an escape from a family home at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's longest vertebrae, it only grows when it's 156
The world’s longest living spine has been confirmed by the ice shark, reports the research published in the Science magazine.
In northern Atlantic regions such as the floating ice shark around Greenland, the holler can live up to 400 years of age.
The female is only growing at 156.
More than a lifetime of ice sharks, it grows only a centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known for longer than live ice.
Researchers found their age with a radiocarbon drive.
Because of the nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
According to these, researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The parent was estimated to be 392 years of age, although throwing in the direction or maybe even 120 years of age.
Donald Trump as a financial visa - News of the People
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenues of the State would not be received if the change of Donald Trump's company tax is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced especially through the richest tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
I'd miss a huge amount, $1,000 a year.
The higher income tax rate is now 39,6 after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax completely.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of the industry and of running small businesses into bankruptcy.
The end-of-life environmental standards must be re-energised and energy regulation broken down.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be renegotiated.
It is necessary to appoint management experts instead of bureaucrats.
According to Trump, the trade policy is one of the most serious causes of the US problems.
The free trade agreements would be debunked.
For imports from China, 45% and 35% of Mexico would be depreciated.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America does not have to change the world:
American cars are going to drive in the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to control at sea, American steel to lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released his own programme early Friday in Finland.
Attack wave from the past - News of the people
The sea is going tomy with fatality, but the actual attack wave is in the middle of Madrid's street crop - an accounting with the past can begin.
It is the core of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Travel lovers (2013) was a little fun and a roskin-side satiric comedy, the previous skin where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish tour's career.
Equally Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a syndicate love, relationship and family drama with mother and daughter at the center.
The story is a simple one, and we'll see a lot of it as a long setback.
Life seems to be modelled for a middle-aged named person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to break down.
In the after-treatments of random encounters, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be surprised to be at all times until the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta once for her adult daughter, who grew up in her life.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Juliet’s young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, will rise in the second female main part, from Ommelte to Ommelt (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be considered a rope, but I'd say that time is kind of weird and literal with one-time wipe.
For almodóvar films, often for such a characteristic rapture, humor is a fair distance to Julieta.
It is a well-played, controlled, place in places with good music and a very sad film in which it is made up of ingredients into electricity.
Instead, the typical visual colour luminosity of the Spanish director is kept, and it starts to put a little bit of quiet in his eye more in a pure shape than a functional dramatic mode of action.
Diseases, deaths, or other sudden loss of consciousness, but the surface remains one Korean.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a nominal person, the costumes vary from one scene to another, and the same applies to shown ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but this is not a particular improvement in the philosophies of the main issue.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has made the script on the basis of the three novels of Alice Munro, a Canadian, awarded by Nobel 2013.
The Novellit has been published in the book Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a little smooth written literature recording.
Materials would have been emotionally more emotionally dramatic, so much bigger things - in particular, pale guilt - thethetics of the film are being dealt with.
Guidance and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Alice Munron.
The main points are Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of film is 12.8.
The government is trying to keep an election trick - Public News
No new cuts will be made, cheap ministers, so that the basic Finns do not collapse in total.
However, operations decided in the spring will be carried out at a crack shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings that have already been closed are sufficient.
In this way Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) under the budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, since social security cuts were decided already in the spring framework.
Childhood, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
The training surgery is continuing.
Locals haunt
Why are the ministers so hard to stress that no new cuts will be made on these?
Because next year is the year of the election.
Locals will be held in April and will be the most important hot conductor of the parliamentary term, not the galloons.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal outcome that leads to the different directions of the government parties is ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
Gallupid, however, says that the basic Finnish government party is waiting for a dribbling loss, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new mandates, which next spring will be realised at the cost of influenceing the right government.
The lifeline of the government of three about the same party is in place for the basic Finnish people to stand.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for it made it necessary for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary visit have also come to the surface.
First of all, new cuts are not to be made - the fact that next year they will be made violently and, second, they will try to soften the basic Finnish - waiting blow.
Major surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if Sipila's government is still up.
The government has set the target of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but the Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will add EUR 5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal councils, there are two options for the government.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt is not folded or even slowed.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means new cuts in the budget line for 2017.
The budget would at least strike a balance in 2018 and then in spring, Parliamentary elections will receive what is coming.
With these measures, debt is not folded
It is quite clear that today's measures do not work out, even if Juha Sipilä is trying to bring about a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen at the information meeting of the budget will prove it irresponsibly:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. no call-out from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recently risen since the collapse in 2008, except in the context of a temporary recovery policy at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
The current government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, is rising to 70% in the mid-2017 of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery presented by the left-hand party was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs approximately EUR 6 billion, which is practically covered by a new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the meeting and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of tasks are wanted for the King
Three out of four consider the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise to be the responsibility of the municipality to be reflected in the study of the KAKS Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also take responsibility for the individual community, including libraries, culture, citizens’ schools, building supervision, upper secondary school and waste management.
On the other hand, the responsibility of the county is more clearly sought in the form of regional planning, special care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institution care for disabled people.
There is no desire to transfer any tasks under local government responsibility.
The underage driver ran a chase to the end of the drive to run away from the police.
A 16-year-old motorcycle in Joensuu ran away from the police department at Ilomanants Friday night at half an hour.
The police department tried to stop without the lights of the time of the motorcycle, but the young man left to run the police for a fair speed.
The back-up continued on the Sonkajaranna road, from which to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran out of the way.
After this, the young man left the runaway, but the faster the police ran into the fugitive.
The driver's blow test showed a 0.75 prom.
He also had no driver's license to drive on a motorcycle.
The case is being examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into the ditch.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into its stream at the Polvijärvi on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved corner out of the way and fell on its side of the fence.
The rescue facility pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door to the other side, together with the rescue helicopter personnel and the emergency servicekeepers.
Raising the vehicle remained the responsibility of the car owner.
The truck fell off the road with hydraulic oil that the rescue plant sucked into peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the airline.

The elements of a major accident in the air - see the image gallery of the damage to Parafest
The impact current that fell from the parafest festival's tents caused massive damage.
The President of the Parafestyhtition in Joensuu, Mr Piper, estimates that the festival will be economically accessible, and the event can also be held next year.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the Parafest, was performing on the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue on presentations held at the City Theatre premises starting at 13 a.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is at the Parafest exhibition 13-15.
The programme shall be organised as planned.
The cleavage flow is generated in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger the descending air flow.
The changes in the state of the water in the water are binding heat, and therefore the descending air cools and speeds towards the ground.
Air science has been reported by the Finnish Air Science Institute that ecclesiastical flows occur in Finland during several summers.
It's hard to predict the route of the currents.
The crash flow hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum at Parafest’s location on Friday afternoon before the five.
Three tents fell, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were mildly injured.
There was one child in the group who was mildly injured in the further treatment.
Air pollution from the ageing Londoners
According to the study, the skin of the Londoners is getting older faster than usual.
Air pollution is the cause of skin ageing.
The British study tells us about Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many Londoners of retirement age is two and a half years older than an age partner living in rural areas.
Skin aged small particles are a very fine dusting level, starting from transport’s fuels.
The same particulates also cause respiratory diseases, to which, according to Evening Standard, nearly 9 500 London people die every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially to the Londoners who walk on their way to the busy streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, by various masks, but it is recommended that regular cleaning be a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed a man standing in front of you.
He had moved stones on his tractor in his yard.
When he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor's brakes failed, and the tractor fell on the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor made it to the point that he was transported to the Central Hospital with serious injury to further studies.
The tractor couldn't go any further, because it ran into the stones ahead.
Retirement to New Power in the Future Age
The River’s League Riento, which is playing in the Championship, leaves a series of better starting points than man’s memory, starting in October.
The team's been together for three weeks.
It is safe to find a single text better than in the previous seasons, when Rienno’s beginnings have been darker.
Jani Säis, who continues to be the head coach of the conflict, calls the new team an attempt and unity.
Fred Musoni, from the 3rd abroad, begins his second season in Rien.
The new face is 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, performs in Rwanda's country team, is a 20-inch hacker.
Garchet is a passport accordingly, with a measure of 198 cents.
Through Joban, Kataja, and the River Boys, to the U.S. National Team
Anne Jpartner has played almost all the salibandy MM games since 2003.
Now, in Tampere, there are already 6th races, only 2013 between Canada and being better off in North America.
I was working at Turku and playing with that woman's company when I noticed the report.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy national team.
I'm interested and here we are, Jpartneren, 48, says.
The partner was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth City.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, the JPP got to the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, it wasn't like the kind that was played at the SM level.
This was played by the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later in River Boys hockey in the SM series, Jpartner remembers.
The partner played with the university in Salibandy SM series in 1991-92, followed by three times by Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the company's A-girls in the championship.
Women's SM series career peaked in 1995.
A total of 169 matches 51+34=85 were played by the JP in women's SM series.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vänännen were named on the ground team
Josba was raised by the Joensuun Salibandy Society in Perttu Puska and the enotic Tatu Vänänänen was elected to the Finnish National Team to play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old who attacks one, has played this before six men's match, where he has gained a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Vänänen, has recovered from the traveling gap and is part of the country team's standard fishing fleet with the experience of 117 country matches.
The country team was also named the co-player Mika Kohonen, who was seen in the Finnish shirt for the last time in the World Cup last December.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasun's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
At least after a temporary period, Essi Hasu is ending as a beach valley player.
Beach’s new Finnish championships will be decided on the weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over three days, medals will be played in both adults and young people.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Ballooners and the Finnish Airball Association, the SM-Final tournament is qualified for the six best pairs in each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäe's NMKY, who has been a member of the Finnish boat volley peaks for several years.
Today, the Hasu living in Helsinki is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the viewer this weekend.
I'm sure it's gonna be a great arena for a Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the final home corners, Hasu atmosphere.
The Kouvola region set fire to Hassu's spark sport and gave good lunch to a fine hobby.
There are very good memories of being a child.
When I was 9 years old, I started volleyball in the E-girls of Elimäe's NMKY.
Top of the mind is too big to play shirts, knee protectors in the ankles as well as huge acetocks and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's life created an environment that was nice to play in.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate trained us and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
At the time of June, Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural species selection as a counterweight to the inner balloon.
There's been a bit of fun since the 1990s on the other side of the farm.
The action has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour, thinking that one day I'd be there to play.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays on the weekend with Anniina Parkkinen in the SM-Finals.
The second-ranked dual goal of the tournament after Rigan and Taru Lahti is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack SM gold in the prize locker, Hasu throws dignity at us.
The presence of the weekend in Kouvola may be in front of the last known audience of Hasulle.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected for civil work.
After the Kisakallio tournament, yes, the international career is over.
Otherwise, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon’s Koli bravely went out as an agricultural contractor
Agriculture, as an entrepreneurship, means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an farmer because he also believes in a positive future in the countryside.
A few years ago, Koli and her little brother Valtteri Koli started acting as a successor to their homeroom.
Their father, Mark Koli, helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant taking up the debt and order an increase in the order for bread to come from the agriculture of the hand.
It's been my thing since I was a kid.
I've always been happy at the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it's gotta be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yardboat, and at first the bank was not very excited about it.
I myself, however, was very courageous in the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon’s Koli, and added that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything will be turned to good.
Solomon Kol’s goal of raising meatcars is to invest in its even bigger navet.
The work has resulted, for Solomon’s Koli has been chosen as the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Earth’s Future magazine.
At the same time, he's competing for a possible win.
He can be put to the vote on the website until 21.8.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when positive 0.2% were reported.
The average annual inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8 % in the last 12 months (February 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (February 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate was -0.2 %, and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2 % compared to July 2015.
Compared with the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The “Snapchatin” power is appreciated as an Asian career
Snapchat says anime has been the source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
With its bird tool, Snapchat allows its daily user about 150 million with realism editing and identity playing ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an anaks, a dog or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The birds are simple, face - altering tools that produce over 30 million improved selfie per day.
All the delusions quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have been previously criticised by the accusation that the application advertises the blackface mask or favors the bleached skin color as a beauty hand.
So when Snapchat was advertised this week to some users in the lens that gave them a hint of eyes, a hint of teeth, and a sticky cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - a yellow mask, or a yellow face.
And they were wondering if these repeated absences could be a sign of the company's greater problem in terms of diversity.
News and misbelief spread over a wide-ranging Wednesday with reports from The Vergen and Motherboard, the day later, Snapchat said that he had ceased to possess.
The company offered an explanation: Linssi was meant to be an honor to anime people, not a caricature of Asians.
But for those who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others banned anime comparison with a lot of people.
Grace Sparanopani, a Korean-American art student, widely distributed in the photographs, said in her e-mail that the lens was at least offensive and uncomfortable,
He added that it was difficult to argue against a comparison with the next toughest Asian katik and filter strengths.
It shows that the filter is not only a yellow-faced one, but a yellow-faced one with extreme defamation.
Snapchat is not the only attempt to cross these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporations meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all stand in our hands.
And the vast, racially older audience of young people who are more diverse means that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said at the interview on Thursday that when one of the Snapchat lens creates a user offensive image, it is much more difficult for these types to be unnoticed.
On Thursday Zhu, product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove their Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In his article to Medium and phone interviews, he said he believed that the race-related disputes reflect the lack of diversity of Snapchat’s pay practices.
Zhu criticised the company primarily of white male wires and decided to write on Hashtag #DelateSnapchat (#PastaSnapchat)
\"If they do not have a wide range of skin color representations in their staff, so they can make decisions like this,\" said Zhu, Chinese-American, \"or they have representatives of different skin colors, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly,\"
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not make public figures of the diversity of its staff, taking note of its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss his staff with a racer, but the representative said the company hired the recruiter to focus on the under-represented populations and to move on to internal integration efforts.
Zhu said in part that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: \"Is it true that they need more users like us in order to say that this is not okay?
According to Congress panel, military officials have distorted Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that intelligence reports from the U.S. military headquarters were more optimistic about the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than was justified by the events on the ground.
The Interim Review Report of the Task Force Committee of the DRC, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Fund Sub-Committee found that there was widespread dissatisfaction among the main intelligence analysts, who said that their superiors failed to judge the American efforts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the military military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, who oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence outputs accepted by the higher-value Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of US anti-terrorist efforts than were justified by the facts on the ground; they were generally more positive than the analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community, ” the press report stated.
\"The events at Centcom are unacceptable - in the war of our fighters, when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers,\" said Agent Ken Calvert, California Republican.
The failures of Centcom's leadership reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the continuing problems in the main descriptions and analyses of the United States' efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence of the fact that the high-value administrative authorities of Obama’s regime would have ordered the reports to be broken down, it describes the analysts as if Centcom’s leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic state, Isis, in a more positive light.
“For the first half of 2015, a number of press releases, opinions and certificates for Congress were much more positive than the events themselves, ” the report said.
For example, the Centcom authority stated in public that a major attack on the recovery of Mosulin could even begin as early as in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isisi's hands.
\"After months of study, this is very clear,\" said the opinion, Mr. Mike Pompeo, Republican Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. armed military headquarters senior intelligence leaders manipulated the intelligence outputs of the headquarters to reduce the threat of Isis in Iraq.
After hearing the group, Republicans established that analysts had raised concerns about intelligence data from the Islamic State being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will result in more extensive results when the study is ongoing.
The chief inspector of the Ministry of Defence has commenced an extra ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some Republican Working Group.
\"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created a process of intelligence evaluation between Isis and Iraq's security forces, \", Mr B. Schiff, the committee leader, said in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process extended the publication of intelligence, undermined the mood among analysts, and did not give sufficient room for different perspectives.
Schiff and the Democrats said that they could not find any evidence that the White House would have tried to press Centcom's analysts in order to reconcile their conclusions with the pre-set or political story.
The Daily Beat reports on the initial results of the Congress survey on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon supervisor has commenced an investigation after the Centcom analyst complaints.
In his statement, Commander Patrick Evans, the Pentagon representative, said that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the inspection is ongoing.
But he said that – experts sometimes disagreed with the interpretation of complex information, and that there is a healthy dialogue between the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence on these essential national security issues.
There are other follow-up consequences than the question of whether the US-led bombings are successful in Iraq and Syria (such as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's allegations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the honest assessment of the war on Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The criticism of the Islamic state's intelligence reflects over a decade ago the dispute between the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker, wrote a study article saying that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's regime supported a small army in Iraq and used very little time to reflect on the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also in the key role of the rebellion concerning the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities last year the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, the air attacks against processing by the Islamic State had not significantly undermined the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary processing plants to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the capital.
The Centcom Bridge Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was started to criticise last year, after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive estimate of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win the fourth consecutive woman in the groundhockey, organising an interdependence with Britain.
The day after he had made three goals for the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made Thursday for the U.S. women's mahockey team the first two goals of the American winning Indian 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
I have no idea, he said.
I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a record of his paintings.
But he knows this: The Americans are in the 4-0 Olympics tournament and they share their first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning on Thursday, Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have survived one quarter, and this game will determine who will be the first and who will be the second in their six teams.
The first is to avoid strong Dutch, the second group leader, when a slightly longer quarter is started.
As the end of any Saturday's game, the Americans have awoke their surprising success here, four years after they stayed at the London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and picked up the ground hockey bat for the first time when he was 3 years old (i.e. older twin sisters played in Drexel) in the country team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he failed to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went wrong with him and his teammates.
The following year, the British Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
-Culture change, mental change, physical change, Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the same job rate as we do now.
We've made a complete translation.
Thursday night Bam started the first half-time goal at the impact of the goal.
India had come into the air with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and held the situation in the 1-0s until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball on the left side of the field for a long time, then he rolled in the middle, and he hit the ball in the finish line, taking the Americans to 2-0 wire.
In the middle of the final goal, Melissa Gonzalez added four times.
This zero game was the first American goalkeeper to Jackie Briggs, who had let one goal out of each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
\"We now have a good situation,\" Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The Peace of Trampoliin in the Center of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are running.
Rio de Janeiro events seem to be a continuing and inevitable message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic sound itself is a flaming communication capsule transmitted from a bow to a swimmer and a gymnastic to a triathlonist.
It's impossible to put on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a conversation with a guest friend on the line of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympics' first-time and future pace-breaker with a smiler, could well be one of the names of all those who are represented in the best time of view and supported by sponsorship agreements and by the TV commercials of a good mind - if he were a swimmer, a gymnastic or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from California Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic gold in trampoline.
The Olympics aren't all the species illuminated as much.
Farer from the middle, partly in the shadows, are those which are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistolaammunta, bowball, taekwondo.
We've always got breast-switch, so long as it's alive.
But if I can make a reasonable number of my special favors, I would like to draw attention to the subdued charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it first made its first appearance in Sydney’s competitions, its presence has been so few points in the past 16 years that many I interviewed did not realize at all that it was an Olympic species.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won a medal in it, and its athletes have never advanced to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian are generally divided by men, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, the Chinese Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie McLenna defend their gold medals in London.
Trampoliin, however, has a certain type of pooler charm, partly because it sounds better suited to clown school than to Olympics.
In this case, I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an airless fan.
The species have the potential for amusing, as is seen from the colour of the endless pompoms in the drawings, but it also has the closure of gymnastics and swimming jumps, two species which in principle combine in it.
The word ‘trampoline’ comes from the Spanish word ‘ el trampoline’, which means the poncho board.
The champions jump on a giant trampoline up to a height of almost 30 feet and have to perform floating business series (turns, skills and volleys) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic Games programme, they are assessed on the basis of their execution, difficulty and time of flight.
In Rio, 32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic direction is straight ahead.
The medal of wishes must go into gold in search of longer, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They not only hunt the target line or the starting wall, but also, in television news, the second debunking border: the world or the Olympic show.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical, and can even get the viewer's tears.
But that's also the reason why watching races can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a resting moment here.
Trampoli's heading up.
There's no way to move forward.
The contestant rises to a new rise, seemed weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then up painlessly again.
Of course, this does not affect competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jump to distance, just a dream of time and gravity, a smooth stop.
It's as close to the Zen state as the Olympics can get.
Women's Caring Competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 13.00 (ET), men's races will also come Saturday at 13.00 a.m.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software from 14 p.m. to 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympics, they offer a quiet, charming moment, which, most likely, does not notice in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be watched and subjective (as the US male champions recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his delicious new fanship.
\"The generation shows its mind in Ethiopia, a long-term ally in the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protestors demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced a violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnessers say that dozens of protestors have been shot to death in meetings with the police.
Is Ethiopia about to break?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable African countries, a strong Western ally whose economy is rapidly growing.
In recent months, however, anti-government demonstrations have plagued the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
In the last week alone thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding an in-depth political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was pathetic.
The witness said that the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protestors.
The broadcasts, recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities beat young people while they were forced to stand against the wall with their hands.
The United Nations Supreme Court of Human Rights is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
“Keeping this country together was always difficult, and it will continue to be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, a project manager of the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group study group.
Ethiopia is the second country in Africa after Nigeria, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
The American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threat of the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital in Addis Ababa has even a new train for business travelers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not, however, been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government oppression, the opposition of the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been banished from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven far to the desert.
But this could be changing.
\"If you suffocate people, and they have no choice but to show their minds, \"this is what will happen, Seyoum Teshome, university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All the young people show their minds.
One generation shows their minds.
Complaints are diverse and cover all the disciplines of the coalition that governs land use.
The ruling party with its allies after last year's much-critical elections has the last place left by the opposition, and now it has to hold all the seats of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea are growing, and this battle along the tight and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Orome Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less destroyed over the last few years, can try to exploit the dwindle and re-arm off.
A number of factors explain why bitter emotions are now about to explode after they go under the surface of the years.
The first seems like a seemingly harmless one: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media when the cheaper smartphones have become popular and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still signal the location through hidden network transmission servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the orphans and the Africans, will work better together.
Oromes and affidavits are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Africans, who come mainly from the Christian uppers of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business using orphans, many of which are Muslims and who live on the lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
\"We're on our way from organized into one umbrella,\" said the Oroman Mulatu Gemechu.
The greatest demonstrations have been in the African and Oromocese areas.
Many Africans and orphans think that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the tiger people. The population covers about 6% of the population and controls the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawin.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors in making opponents unhappy.
\"There is no basic instinct like it,\" said the conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknownly to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was home from the North-Etiopia tigrel area, Haiemaram is from the south.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many are afraid that this can lead to increased bleeding.
On the previous occasion, Ethiopia was in control of such a debauchery in 2005, when thousands expressed their opinion on the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have the government first executed and then robbed them.
During the follow-up blow, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their views on infrastructure planning, such as the new communautaire train, and significant progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not stopped the internal occupation of Ethiopia's government.
And now it's getting dangerous, ethnic shape.
In the last month, protestors in Gondar were attacking tiger-owned companies, and hatred against the tiger becomes more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations place the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to Somalia, even though it recently said that it closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want their ally in the unstable region to collapse either.
This, Abdi said, \"There's no real balancing.\"
Donald Trump explains Obama's basic father-in-law claim to be sham.
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle his latest campaign against the debate on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when this week he was inspired by numerous times that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have worked hard to defend him during the stormy period, in a difficult position, in which they must explain the remarks he does not necessarily mean.
After a suggestion made at Wednesday night's campaign meeting, Trump said the same thing was more and more eager at Thursday's interviews, where he inspired that his intention was indeed to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
Early on Friday morning Twitter release Trump, however, said that he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete translation from the day before when Trump said that he had been in several interviews for serious accusations.
When Mr Hewitt, the Conservative radio driver, tried to help Trumpia dilate his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his listening ears.
The last criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has attempted to refocus his campaign in the midst of the results of the polls that fall into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday Trump tried to return to the subject.
I'm on Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump's been using sarcasm before.
Later in July, after he encountered a wide-ranging criticism apparently when he suggested that the Russians hack into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remarks by saying that I am sarcastic.
The approach allows Trump to make a political speech on the borders and then return if necessary.
“I think it’s a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then “clear up” in the direction or in the other depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is attractive to his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for a large audience, Trump has been even more baffling in the last few days since his popularity has continued to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Trump is a great drag after Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump, as a general rule, is trying to avoid being apologizing for what he has said, he often blames his critics for misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
During his ever closer examination during the last months of the presidential election campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to become uncomfortable, in which they must publicly support him, regardless of how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giulian, who is one of the most important supporters of Trump, had a lot of trouble defending the candidate at CNN's interview on Thursday.
“I believe that his words have real, political comments, ” Giulian said, “as he was asked about the reality of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded a Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateurs, totally wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most of the powerful Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama Government, where Clinton worked as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to manage the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings Trump continued on Twitter an attack towards the newsmedia, which cooled him every word and are partial to him.
He made fun of the fun, the pathetic, the TV experts who were trying to find out about him, saying, \"They're not gonna make it.\"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for a new evidence that he was inappropriate for being president.
Previously closed cafe returns to GreenPoint
Verb Cafe was a thin, just a cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but who offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the street crash in Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The store that replaced Verbin in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells bakery-shaped soaps.
It was the latest loss by the locals in a central-class town.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBG is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop.
But if New York is a change, it's also a re-conspiration.
Last November, the Elved Verb opened up a GreenPoint, under a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there's the same unprepared atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
There are bacon eggs and cheese sandwiches on the menu, and there are, for example, capers and browned onion on the table.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the coffee shop, but fresh juices are being made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old stem customers.
\"Williamsburg also became too expensive for many former customers,\" he said.
One last Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was one of these clients.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to GreenPoint, he walked into the cafe.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up coffee for a while.
I realized that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture, he said.
Now he's back with the coffee, although that day he ordered a chai drink, which is one of the new additions, instead of his usual coffee.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been to Verb since 2003.
He used to go to work there, and he always made the same order.
Every day over seven, on a regular basis, I went in, and they were making my bagel butter, he said.
The photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes due to variation, he has room for a spiced bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says that he does not wear a grudge to a soap shop that took over the old holdings.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to prepare for Verb for a special soap that would make use of the cooled coffee in the cafe as a ingredient.
I think we can still take the offer, Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of GreenPoint have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to set it up soon to get his new neighbours to feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local coffee shop wants to bottle up and sell cold coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand into the next building.
Many customers have enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a senior client, and he said it was harmless when the place was shut down.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt as if he had come home walking in and ordering coffee.
I was looking forward to smelling it, he said.
A Square Meal: Laminate Food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office room.
President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue food, like the goose mascara, and Maryland's sorority pastry.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce and dessert from the bone-blower.
It was an expression of culinary solidarity for people who suffer, Jane Ziegelman said.
His mate Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat,
The couple in Brooklyn Heights is food historians.
Coen's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about his life at the Lower East Side apartment with food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food during the great depression of the 1930s.
By showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they will meet a journalist for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unpopular lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been active since 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the journalist ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the sheep season.
The berries were very popular, Ziegelman said.
There was peanut breaker, liver breaker, baked beans.
They were made from the material and some of the cheap ingredients that continued the actual material.
Imagine your cancer so much peanuts that they could form your dinner.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
I'm sure it's been feeling like lead fat in the stomach, he said.
During the years before the recession on American tables, especially in the countryside, there was a table like eating-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-cs.
Women’s groups fed male farm workers, and fresh pies were served with breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I, and the Square Meal Book crowned the ways in which the nation survived to the suddenly no longer being a land of luxury.
At that time, the food became a central, distressing topic for the Americans, so Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mysterial dishes, such as the puddles and boxes, became the main food, and the box was a great way to use the food stars, said Zigelman, because the cooks were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Of the meat that had been in the middle of the American meals for years, it became a smugly administered luxury product.
Special ingredients were tested with calories and nutrient content more important than flavour or even healthy sense in the kitchen.
When carrying out a study for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared the age of a type of food filled with groundnuts.
It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table, Coe said.
Ziegelman said: \"It was unreal.
Nutmeg butter is no match for baked onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, Head of the Federal Office for Households in 1923-1943, directed the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
In the newspapers and magazines of publishers, they encouraged women to become budgeters and to respond to the challenge of transforming the resemblances of forgotten champagne and carrots into delicious doses.
A Square Meal is a party for historical sausages.
Particularly tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat cake weapons.
At the same time as he publicly praised his childhood with a simple, iowaish earthly food, he ate as a sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce, so Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in a almost-decorated dining room with a tuxedo on his head.
He was great out there.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, would have encouraged him to be an example in his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in sleeping, the White House became a place that –not only served as one of Washington's most generous food, but also as the worst prepared food -
Many of the lay - time meals were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The tradition is our constant concentration of calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they achieved a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, of how she was unable to throw away food.
He was really afraid to waste food, Coe said.
Ziegelman remembers, \"He even sick people,
There was a wind attack.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the bone marrow food that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
\"It's called a bulge,\" said Ziegelman, adding that the common trick was to give a name for modest recipes.
There was no creamy cream in dessert, just cream, some flour, sugar, water, and canal.
Everyone's sinking their spoons unwittingly into their sticky, brown vest.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe did it one time and another.
Speaking of a positive budgeter, he told his wife: \"A little bit of deranged German nuts could help,
Gilead will be replaced by legal expenses in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S.'s engagement court has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the legal expenses incurred by a pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, in the case of patients with hepatitis C, against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from the fees of $200 million after breaking the two Merck patents related to Gilead’s successful drugs in Sovald and Harvin. This exemption followed when a US judge found Merck’s abuses, including false oath and other unethical practices.
In the judgment of Thursday, judge Beth Labson Freeman, U.S.A., said that Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensation for which it was brought against the action.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can clearly improve more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other to court the active substance of Gilead medicines from the owner of the laboratory work on the basis of sofosbuvir.
United States-backed troops say that Manbij, controlled by Isis, has taken full responsibility.
The United States-backed troops have taken over the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border since the last remaining Isis fighters left town, the group representative said Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now studying the city after the last combat team hidden in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 Silipant prisoners who were considered prisoners by the fighters, from the Sharfan Darwish SDF allies, from the Manbij Military Council, to Reuters.
\"We've got our van under control now, but we've started to study it,\" he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015, cost 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax declaration, which showed that the incomes of the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year were $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton donated a million dollars to charity organizations, mainly Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million from Simon & Schuster in his book, which reported his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice-President, Senator Tim Caine Virginia, his wife Anne Holton, published ten years' tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
\"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine set the standard for economic transparency,\" said Jennifer Palmier, campaign advisor from Clinton, in the opinion.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It's normal for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers have called the tax administration's audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
- Your turn, Ian Sams, a Clinton campaign assistant, said on Twitter, when he published a link to the democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Special Adviser to Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he wouldn't allow Trump to publish them until the audits were ready.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his transactions and numerous other ties, such as Russia.
Clinton's been infected with the problem of a web video of publishers on Friday, bringing out visible Republicans who call on Trump to publish their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
He refuses to do what every candidate for President-in-Office of the past decades has done: publish his tax returns, he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times business colonially borrowed a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported, according to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, a rule that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of the taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska Omaha last week, the Buffet, which is located there by Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr Buffett said that he was also in the process of carrying out a tax control and that Trump was not afraid of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was around 32% between 2007 and 2014 and their real combined tax rate was around 40.5%.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their incomes came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton announced $190,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and molluscs enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking to human settlements - they throw animals in chili powdered condoms.
The work has proved to be effective, and several years ago the idea of a Honeyguide Foundation has been developed together with the US Nature Conservancy to enhance its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use an non-violent four-step way of protecting homes and hundreds of animals without causing injury.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
Since we developed the tools, we have seen an attitude change in these communities. They are now much more confident about their ability to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them.
The first two steps are to include the demonstration of an intruding elephant with a flashlight and the call of a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we'll throw the so-called \"chili cloud\".
The condom is filled with chili powder and soil mixed in both layers, and the condom is then closed so that only the lamp wire remains visible.
When the condom is set on fire, it bursts into the dust and crushs the chili powder into the air.
One shot is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is the trigger that shoots the Roman candle in the air. Ilotulite produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: A Jewish film maker criticized a Berlinese hotel that removed Israel's direction number at the request of the Arabs
The French, Jewish-style film maker, after the media storm was revealed, that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli direction number. According to the employer, this is due to the requests from the Arabics.
Claude Lanzmann, a movie of the Shoah document about Holocaust, carried out his frustration at the Berliner Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent overnight stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel's hotel in the country's heading number list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own phone center.
When looking for an explanation, the movie maker took the case to the reception of the hotel.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there was shocking him.
The hotel's recipeist said that this was a \"a carefully thought-out decision of the Kempinski hotel management\".
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the movie maker.
The vast majority of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel's direction number, and the employee is told that he said it was Lanzmann.
The German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, who calls the case a great injustice, reports Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
We were terrified and upset because of the case.
It is already a great wrong in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this chain of hotels.
This doesn't need explanations.
We're waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions, the officer said.
The incident produced quite a counter reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply gave up on the alleged demands of the Arabs.
The second publication pointed out that the hotel in Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly challenged all charges and called it \"indiscriminate\" and \"excretioned\" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“A clear command not to include Israel in the quick selection list was never made, ” says Seddeutche Zeilung, a representative of Kempinski.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used cynic gas and rubber bags against Brazilian students
On Thursday, students joined with the police in the city of Sao Paulo in Brazil when students met to show their opinion on government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bags against protestors.
The problems started when law enforcement tried to break up a student team, which led to police using rubber bags and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express the horror of plans.
According to the suggestions of Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of the Land of Sao Paolo, a little less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing to the walls the temporary president, Mr. Michel Temer, on the graffiti.
This latest demonstration only took place days after the protestors went out as a group to support President Dlame Roussef, who was arrested, as the senate voted for his office.

After the withdrawal of the packages, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70,9 per cent from the previous year, says Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
\"In essence, Iran's bilateral cooperation is one of the main objectives of trade expansion,\" Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5%, with a total of USD 697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16% to USD 158 million.
\"The growth in the van was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons,\" said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year the Russian foreign representative in Iran granted some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly to travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most tourists in Russia for the first time.
\"It would be safe to say that the record of last year's Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,\" he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, whose ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have kept the memories of ancient Persian civilization in good condition, ” he said.
Scotti Callum Skinner hit the finish while the British hit the bicycle gold.
In Scotland, Callum Skinner congratulated his team prince Rio last night, while the three of the British team defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role where his fellow Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy was restored, and the legend was proud of being a young man when he said that he would win the goal by taking advantage of the team from New Zealand.
Britain took the shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick, with a modest sixth March race in the World Championships in London, even though Hoy has decided his competition since.
The problem between the Beijing and London races was the replacement of a special consignor Jamie Staff.
This was achieved just in time for the Hindes to appear.
Hoy's ending also created a void that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man from whom British trainers held up to the potential of a shock that has now been understood.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship four years ago with Hoy, and Skinner did the Olympic show in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British Triangle won a duel for gold.
After his round, Hindes was close, but Kenny put the team in charge, and Skinner kept it.
The strategic change was a major part of the transformation and included Hindes’ driving on a huge gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at the BBC, and he drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the award line.
A 23-year-old in Glasgowian Skinner said: \"The rolling is flattered.
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We did the Olympic show at the final, and we won the world champions.
It was amazing all along.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and the British competition partners have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with overwhelming profits.
Hindes said: “I felt like I had been in London when there were so many British flags on the ground.
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven of all ten cycling species in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we'll have a successful five-day cycling stadium waiting for us.
On the basis of the goodness shown by Kenny, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's urote, winning three Olympics in one of the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (the apparently holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - the total number of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It's like Hoy's.
Kenny's going to compete next in the sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: \"I just laughed at one of these.
The team race is always the best.
It's won together with friends.
To win alone is, to be honest, lonely.
He said, \"If he wins two gold medals, then he should be given the value of the knight,
This was the only medal contest today, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doull were the fastest in time for four lives, four kilometers on the team run.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London in 2012, the world record of gold is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the times when the officials invited him to the length test.
In the same women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Milngavai Katie Archibald advanced the world record at the time of the clock stop at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the center of the Olympic Games and reach the entire range of medals.
After truly extraordinary and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before Rio races.
The background has been a drama, the least of which has not been the difference between the technical leader, Shane Sutton, in April due to sex and temptation charges, as well as the ending of the competition of large persons such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the contests of the first night at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that the legendary reputation of the United Kingdom is now at its peak at a time when it could once again be true.
The future of Portland's falsification in question due to the cut-off of the electricity contract
The future of the Victoria aluminium section of Portland, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity distribution company on the factory revealed that one factory owner is about to conclude a distribution contract, so there is expected to be a cut in all distribution contracts.
The measure follows the earlier decision taken by the Victorian administration this year that the support required for the operation of the plant will not be continued.
The 20-year period will end in November.
Even 2,000 jobs can be put at risk at the Alcoa Portland factory.
Even 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, due to the closure of the factory.
In addition, snowball effect may be possible as the molten plant uses around 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the meltdown of Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power station last year.
Alcoan Portland's molten will lose money and be under the closing threat.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which started with a strong Australian dollar and has recently resulted from the cost of production of the plant.
AGL, which distributes electricity to the large aluminium alloy of the Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects the three other owners to conclude their agreement.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the activity of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the physical electricity consumption of the non-fused plant will continue, ” he said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called 'protection agreements', which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have 12 months' notice, so they will actually expire in 2017.
This is why AGL expects contracts to produce results in the year 2017, the electricity company said.
Any possible impact on AGL from the year 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong prospects of the future electricity wholesale market.
AGL said that it was already before it ended, reducing the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements does not affect the ability of Alcoa ... to keep the melting in operation or to safeguard the electricity supply of the falsification.
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement had to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement was withdrawn.
Analysts have been equipped with both the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the possible closure of the Tomago factory in Newcastle, which is also close to Newcastle, because the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Previously on AGL's CEO, Stephen Mikkelsen, told the analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each week and that Tomago had about 900 megawatts each year.
“If both factories leave the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
For us, as an electric producer, this wouldn't be a good thing, he said.
Kendall, not just the Cardashian true-tv star, is on the cover of the September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-mother Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the United States Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and has been modeled for Milan, Paris and New York fashionists, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
- Watching this deck in a room full of loved people made me cry, Kendall wrote.
The cover publication was followed by a unique (or perhaps only the Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video, where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlin, with all the favorite entertainments, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended in the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It's almost every children's TV series birthday - cliché (Seacrest's playing the lines – you didn't think we'd forget you - with the credibility of the morning-scratching sweater), but Krisin had to get his other girls to benefit from this publicity somehow.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new Kardashian era with the location of Vogue in September.
Kendal’s isos sister Kim may have made Vogue’s action first (which was shared with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is quite his own class.
Vogue's September issue is the most important edition of the year.
Its thickness is more similar to the coffee book than the fashion book, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832-page education last year was advertising content).
Its cover star exposure is so expected that for the last two years, the photos of the magazine have been leaked before official publication.
Former women on deck have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more – publisheds that work as models – such as models that are famous –
The Oscar winner and Diorin Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on deck in 2013, after Lady Gagan's honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, the one described as his generation’s success model, would be hit by his first category, he's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not famous people's relatives or reality stars or young people today who can make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
The cover model of last year Beyoncé has been one of the strongest years of his career with Lemonade publication.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
With his true-tv history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a tad.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and this colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them \"the moment that they were married\"
This feeling rose again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But being dissatisfied is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their applications found behind the payment wall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he took to the LOVE magazine.
And with his leisure time, perhaps just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a true-tv star.
Community judicial centres turn away 160 000 people each year
More than 160 000 people’s most vulnerable will be turned away annually from the Community’s legal centres as the sector prepares for the impact of additional cuts in funding for its activities at the extreme.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and similars - are already turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already drawn to extremes in the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, head of Community Law Centres in Queensland, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not withdrawn, the situation would only get worse.
\"Queensland's legal centres are chronically subcontracted, which means that thousands of people annually will be turned away from the essential services they need,\" he said.
People who go out of violent relationships with uncontrollable and depraved debts, families in the apartment, workers who are unfairly separated - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The Federal Government cuts funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected people in Queensland are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to both the Minister of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year the state government made a commitment to raise the funding of legal aid at the national average level.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Government of Palaszczzuki should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged after the employee’s alleged threat of a weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged in the court for claiming that they did nothing after they were told that the campaign’s head of activity in North Carolina threatened with a gun worker in February when driving them in Jeep.
The incident was described in an action brought by former state software practitioners Vincent Bordin on Wednesday in Charlotte by the State Court.
He said that he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that it would not happen.
Chief Earl Phillip pulled out the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap.
Following the complaint to the local and regional campaign management, the Bordi heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, the complaint said.
You don't have to fire things to cause harm.
The challenge is only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that the people of another addition would normally be treated by the gun owners and the armed forces would take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word out of the context and that he is not in favour of violence.
In the case of Brenda, the campaign will seek compensation for reckless supervision and for violence, assault and emotional distress.
Mr Hope Hicks, representative of Trump, did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
Firms reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, local news company Charlote reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
No immediate response was received from his consultant company to the Innovative Consulting Service call request.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case against the President is Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity throughout the stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For myself, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 races, when we saw enormous effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the competitions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
There are only 10 000 new training places and 40 000 new jobs for local communities, and youth unemployment around the airport will be removed.
Just as before the London 2012 race, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be ashamed of ourselves in front of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is asked to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion new economic growth, both to leave the legacy of skills and employment around both the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who has implemented 11 billion pounds of infrastructure in time and in the budget, remaining: T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world in five years, in a row between T2, which was built between the two fastest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by 16 billion billion dollars of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and to extend Heathrow, to ensure the future of our trade and to create a legacy of skills and employment, which Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Secretary to the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse play to prevent advertising
For companies receiving money from online advertising, companies are – cat and mouse – said one of the companies producing such a programme.
Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog writing that said users could update the program filters to prevent advertising on the social network pages again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its website is exchanged around ads to make it more difficult for advertising inhibitors to see which parts of the website are advertising.
But now Adblock says it's been going around the new code.
In the Blog Paper, Ben Williams, a representative of Adblock, wrote that the ongoing fight between the open source advertising community and its entrants has been running ever since the fight against advertising was invented, and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the tragedy of advertising inhibitors has become an industry.
At the global level, around 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, are reported in the study of Pagefair and Adobe last year, which is nearly four times the amount used by these programmes in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook with mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
The company is, however, after advertising inhibitors on computer pages, because mobile advertising inhibitors do not operate on Facebook's mobile applications to the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer advertising is still producing enough income to make Facebook think that such an operation is worth investing.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its \"promotion\" tool in order to give people more power about how advertising is targeted to them.
Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also prevent part of the site from being non-advertising.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem, ” said Facebook’s representative in the e-mail report.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
The woman was hit by a car on a Swiss motorway, apparently because of her suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman left on the freeway under several vehicles during early Thursday hours in case of suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 route near Morges in Vaud's Canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did an unsatisfied act and lay in the dark on the road where several vehicles hit her, the Vaudin police said in the statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, reported a police officer who appeals to them and all the witnesses who have witnessed the incident to report.
The criminal investigation has started, which is a \"logic\" step in this situation, and the lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genevelle.
However, let us see if any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid an impact?
It's gonna be settled by the D.A., Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that drivers are not held responsible.
In either case, where both had a person walking on a dark freeway, it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, the magazine said.
Last year the police were released from prosecution after he was hit and killed by a man who lay near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drank and passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police, which was responding to the emergency call, were in a reasonable fashion, and that the presence of a man on the road was quite exceptional and unpredictable, the judge said.
Anyone who has information about a Thursday's case near Morges should call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus had once to live
According to NASA’s new climate model estimates, Venus was likely to have lived once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine if Venus would have hot, waterless surfaces and CO2 fill the air developments could sometimes have been earthlike conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’s slow speed of rotation is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and still could have run slowly.
The model also looked at the formation of the surface of the early Venus.
The planet was likely to have areas that were drier than the Earth, but once there was sufficient water and geographical variation to make life possible and to protect the water from evaporation.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30 per cent darker than the sun.
“In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus’s slow rotation reveals its day-to-day sun for almost two months at a time, ” explained the GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the newsletter.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that works as a umbrella to protects the surface from the heat of the sun to a large extent.
The end result is the average temperature in the climate, in fact, a few degrees cooler than the Earth's present temperatures.
The model produced a story of Venus's development that is similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to have lived at times, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and its water vapours burned in the light of ultrasounds.
When the hydrogen escaped, there was only one thick carbon dioxide atmosphere left with the most deadly greenhouse gas phenomena we now know.
Researchers shared the results from their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters publication.
Patrick Roy's giving up the Avalanche Coach's nest.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the action of Coach Colorado Avalanche and Vice-President of the hockey issues, i.e. the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Deputy Director-General of Colorado, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
\"For the last three years, I've done my duty as Vice President of the Ice hockey issues in Colorado Avalanche and as head coach with passion, passion and determination,\" said Roy, who was 50 years old in the opinion.
I have been thinking for a long time during the summer, and I have taken it to a higher level to improve this team to give it the depth it needs.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of coach and hockey matters should be fully in line with the Organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
\"Patrick told me today of his decision,\" Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him every success in the future.
Roy was appointed the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach during the first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the central division to victory, but Minnesota fell in the first round of Colorado's playoffs, and the team hasn't continued in the last two years.
Avalanche's games over the period 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 loss and 4 payoffs, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the wild card to drop down.
Hall of Fame elected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North oil workers continue negotiations and delay strike
The labor struggles of oil workers in the North Sea are postponed when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The oil-field service company against Wood Group has been randomly organized by Royal Dutch Shell-led drilling trucks in the North Sea.
\"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to reinitiate the process of resolving the current dispute,\" read the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problem.
According to the trade unions, their recent work struggles, which they claim to be the first more than 25 years, were opposed to possible pay cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut fees for North Sea contractors by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s remuneration reduction is followed by a 10% reduction of its contractors in its countries for 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary mobility space to cope with the decline in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from their list of wages and announced their plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company will reduce its activities as a result of its giant fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is aggravated by the June British decision to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson, from Scotland, met with the ally leaders earlier this week to discuss one generation of the largest labour disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
We need a economy that works for many people, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country, he said in the opinion.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years is around $7 billion.
Kepler measures star rotation speed in the Plejad's star range
The last task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to help astronomers collect the most complete list of Plejad's stars' rotational speeds.
The new data will help astronomers to understand why the starship stars spin at varying speeds, and how the orbits relate to the planet's formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star groups, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age and even the history of its solar system, ” said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis in the press release
The Plejajad Starship is located 445 light years from the Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, and they are about to reach adulthood.
They're running at their top level now.
At the peak speed of the cycle, these growing stars are burning large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star gets older, it's gonna slow down.
Kepler measures each star’s speed of rotation by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star clouds, such as sunlight.
The latest list of star rotational speeds suggests that more mass stars spin slower than massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, the bigger ones make the devils slower than the smaller ones.
\"In the ball, we see that the slow wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest spinsters are usually very light stars,\" Rebull said.
Since the Plejads Starship is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the characteristics of the stars at rotational speeds.
\"The Plejajad's Starship provides anchoring in the theoretical models of the stars, which cover both directions, younger and older,\" Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak, hang their dance shoes.
Rebull and his colleagues described their most recent analysis of Plejajad's rotational speeds in three articles which will be published soon in the Astronomic Journal.
