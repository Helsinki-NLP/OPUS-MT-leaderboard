There was a 9-year-old boy in Tampere runaways.
The police have had a search mission for a nine-year-old boy on the run to Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance statement on the boy who left from West Trampere with his friend has spread to social media.
According to the police station, the boy's been contacted, and he's not in danger of life and health.
The son's father told East Solomon half-night, knowing he had a son.
He's fine, and now we're starting a set-up.
The boy was found in the neighborhood near the home. Dad told me.
Ronaldo once again as a charm... rips the goal difference to the Messin.
Cristiano Ronaldo struck five goals in Spain's league weekend and continued his factory in the Master's league.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Master's league goal queen turned at least for a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time target statistics when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits from the penalty kicks and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his paint balance to 80 when before Tuesdays with him, Barcelona Messi, who was even-ready, had 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
The Juventus has compromised the Italian football league in Serie A from the early days, but at the Master's League's D-section it began with a forceful 2-1-visual victory in Manchester City.
The conqueror did a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city attack was bored by the absence of a kneeling Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend dial game, came to the field only on the last ten minutes of news.
Also, the Manchester Second Society United experienced hardships against PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
The visit to Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old paratrooper, could only last a quarter of an hour.
The dangerously-looking slideback of PSV Hector Moreno hit the goal of an attack on the ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw lay on Eindhoven's home stand for tens of minutes before the medical staff went to carry him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to the 1-0 wire in 41 minutes, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno set off before the break with more time.
In the second half, the PSV’s winning painting was made by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Master's league of the paintmaking season, Paris Saint-Germain started the A-block.
The case was the change of Manchester United's shirt to the PSG, Argentinan Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball in the rear corner of Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 PSG for the second half.
The PSG has been ranked among the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of too longevity, is not the best reference target.
The first time Zlatan Ibramovic, the PSG star hunter, met Malmo FF, his professional career.
Ibramovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow TsSKA lost the B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce - the president gave the wrong speech.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had spoken a month ago.
The Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe, has again spoken in Parliament at the end of last month.
In his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91 years old in full spirit.
The main opposition party MDC insisted on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to control.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place solely in Mugabe’s office and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with China's influence on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading summits, assesses the request.
According to Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how they would be more effectively registered in Europe.
Negotiations on asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, part of the Internal Ministers' table.
The teacher admits he'd shot his girlfriend during a distress call.
The sound is just a little bit of a college teacher, Shannon Lamb, telling the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that her \"a dear dog\" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the loved ones of the dead woman can be found on this phone.
The cops inside the house found Amy Prentiss' body and the message on the green side: “I am so sorry that I could cancel this loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me, ” said a letter that according to experts is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to a school campus where police believe that she had shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this workshop.
The Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told the university staff about the shooting at 10.18 p.m.
She said that Lamb called the fatal emergency phone some time after.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose another one: Lamb committed suicide when surrounded by a police officer.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive for the day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the shooting of the school.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher who, however, may have had problems.
Students told me that they were waiting for her hours.
The DEA, Gautier, says Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included in the book Lamb's book, where he thanked the fine people with whom he shared his academic life.
Both of them taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers complimented Lamb, but said that she also seemed nervous and restless, even though something was wrong,
Another student, Mike Sykes, said Lambin told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for medical leave at Delta State University, saying that she had some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay policies meant that even though Lamb had worked hard for her doctorate, it did not give her automatic career development and assistant professorship.
The head of the university, William LaForge, said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt in his knowledge, but that clearly there was something in Lamb's mind:
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had escaped from campus, the police got to her after she moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the back yard of a house about a half-mile south of her parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, reported Methel Johnson, the D.C.K.K.D.'s killer.
Lamb's car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught road and educational studies. The University has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb performed a doctorate in the field of education in spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through friends together.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny older guy who tried to teach Hairston for many years to play guitar.
He was quite a charm for those days.
All the girls were fused when he was there, told Hairston, 40 years old, who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that she killed her wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss' former husband, Shawn O'Steen, told them that he divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now he has a 19-year-old daughter.
He's really upset, O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me that he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together on some gig.
O'Steen told me that his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
The bar bar near Gautier’s wedding bar The Jules Room’s bartender and a time-table entertainment operator Mike Shaffer tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss the last night until September 5th, when Lamb had finished her guitar and lipstick performance for the rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
- Only a happy couple, she said.
We were messing with each other, and we threw shit at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
The deceased teacher Schmidt led the first year student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, reported the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied at the Emporia State University of Kansas and was chairman of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night at Cleveland Delta State, a candle charter was held, involving some 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mass, during which the university choir sang songs from Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Education continues on Wednesday.
We're trying to get our students back, LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Cleveland Mississippi.
The Associated Press author Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the police saying now that Lamb called the emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that even though Lamb referred to her as Prentiss' wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not employ as many employees for the holiday period as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that the current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres throughout the country when the number of employees was 45,000 during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday, the Christmas season is approaching and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help in the occupation of shops and in the sale, delivery and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his date with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film back to the future was a huge moment of professional importance for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
\"We were sitting at the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that I was sitting next to me empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me,\" he said a future documentary film at Back in Time's trailer.
The movie begins and reminds me that I'm just a cup of tea and a stretch of my hand away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film \"Back to the Future\" interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecks and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, he got his first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me: “For me, it is without a doubt the finest time travel movie ever.
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The UN Head of Staff says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved by armed means
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict will not be resolved armedly, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Head of Mission again called on all parties, including the distributed UN Security Council, to join and support non-discriminatory negotiations in order to find a political solution.
At a press conference last Wednesday, Ban told us that he was going to meet with five permanent Member States - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - Foreign Ministers in connection with the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces had made it impossible to resolve the situation.
Mr Ban called on five permanent Member States to show Syria's crisis in dealing with the type of solidarity and consensus they showed when they agreed on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 support polls showing Donald Trump's serious.
Some people have been trying to find him as a windmill.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some of us are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the suffering studies, it is not (the other) successful.
Of the latest 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge of the two-digit century, and some have seriously begun to wonder what this means for the appointment of the building king.
The election is, of course, only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing command to Herman Cain, which neither received any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in public elections.
However, the external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative Economic Organisation Club for Growth, have noted Trump's tightness and started to use his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent evidence of support suggests that the real estate king is not just a transient phase:
Trump's favorite numbers have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University suffering survey showed that only two Republicans of ten were positive about the property king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans are in favour of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
Last week, 60 percent of Republicans at the University of Quinn's survey of support in Iowa said that they welcome Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republicans would be pleased if Trump were to become a candidate.
In CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would be either 'intelligent' or 'satisfied' if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be \"crazy\" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson will produce the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% - interested - vs. Trump's 40%).
Next most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be unsatisfied or shocked if Jeb Bush’s favorites were to become a candidate.
The nature of Trump's fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trumppis has been widely criticised for his powerful speeches and insults, on Monday ABC News/Washington Post-quisel says 52% of Republican-centred voters at national level think that the property king has an appropriate character for the president.
According to a survey conducted last week on the Quinn market, the first party meeting in the Iowa state is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trump has an appropriate character for the leader.
According to the ABC/Post survey, 44 percent think that his character is not appropriate for the president, and almost six out of ten think that his character does not belong to the White House.
Republicans get used to the idea.
When Republicans think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asking who is most likely to be nominated for Republican candidates.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information disclosure: voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball available.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans agreed that Rick Perry would be appointed candidates and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mit Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of voters in the Republican Party consider Trump's campaign credible.
Even if Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a straight line is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided between numerous other candidates.
However, the survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority of support in almost all cases.
He runs Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubiota with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bushia with 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasichi and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that wins Trump?
If they were put in the opposite position, Ben Carson would beat the businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just about the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told us that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump have decided who their voice goes.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be entirely sure that they would never change their minds.
46% said that they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgery Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say that Trump agrees with immigration.
Since Donald Trump, two months ago, called the Mexican migrants \"raisers\", in his campaign analysis, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some people are concerned that Trump's power concentration is driving latino voters further away from the Republican Party and damaging the rebranding companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
The collapse of the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post survey that they prefer to choose a person outside politics rather than a person with a government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, the Des Moines Register/Blomberg survey on Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are unsatisfied, and 21% are really angry.
Jeremy Corbyn's first visit to the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly expected since his election
Jeremy Corby, new president of the Labour Labour Party, will meet David Cameron for the first time in Question Time.
Corby rises to ask about his first six questions shortly after midday, and probably both media and workers' representatives closely watched his performance.
Corby's been calling for this week's show - a little less theater and more facts -
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to take care of.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the trade unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour Party leader to stand quietly during the National Song during the Tuesday's memorial service, which was held in the Battle of Britain on the 75th anniversary of the World War, has raised criticism of the Conservative Party on the referendums and appeared in several front page cases.
Corby's decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention.
The representative of Corbyn spoke with respect to his status, and that he recognizes the courage of the Royal Air Force in the Great Britain Air War.
The member of Corbyn's shadow government, Owen Smith, stated to the BBC Two Newsnight program that he would have called the leader of the Labour Party to sing a national song, despite the fact that he thought the royal house should be terminated.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved within the Corbyn area, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs; less than sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as a leader.
Robin Brant, a BBC political correspondent, says that the differences in line between the position of the party in the European Union and the government's ceiling of assistance have come together, including within the Labour Party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said, at the meeting of the professional associations, that the Labour Party would present a change that would remove the entire roof.
A few hours later, Secretary-General for Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, Mr Smith said that the party was very clear about the fact that they are only opposed to government plans to calculate 26 000 pounds from the ceiling to 23 0,000 pounds.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has met in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to policy, and he is now telling us that he has made the most of the ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Islington North's representative, Corby, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's polls is too controversial and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and eavesdropping, instead of focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corby has said that Secretary of the shadow government Angela Eagle will act as his substitute for Question Time when Corby is not involved - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should be able to speak sometimes, and he has said that he has approached the sub-room president, John Bercow, on the lines of the matter.
When Cameron came to the leadership in 2005, he said that he wanted to move further away from a political theater that is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he had to admit his failure.
Since they were on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important meter in assessing the rationality of the leader, the management of his sub-room, and his position among other representatives, even though critics have criticised Question Timers for having become just an irritant image that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Young homeless are trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profitable studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and win profits from it.
The BBC News met one of the young people who had completed the first project.

The increase in the value of the pounds is rising as the wage rises in Britain
At the same time, the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, Britain's wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent from that time last year.
The rate of growth was fastest after 2009, and it was considered to be accompanied by estimates of the rise in the rates.
The cost rose by more than 1% to USD 1.5505 and 0.84 per cent to EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at an increase of 1.49 per cent to read 6229,21.
SABMiller was the most differentiated market share and rose by 20 per cent after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The agreement would combine two world-wide major brewery and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9 per cent after encouraging news from Richmont, the competing luxury group.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the mining company reported that it had collected 2.5 billion dollars by launching shares as part of its debt restructuring strategy.
Packing and Paper Group Mondi's shares were the largest in the index, with 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendations from company to company-sales-
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports clothing company announced half a year before taxes: 83 per cent rise to 46.6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can harm enlargement
The director of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that if workers’ minimum wage is increased in the UK, it can mean that the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase.
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, says Cowgill.
The costs could be directed towards the company’s enlargement plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches a grass roots campaign against the intrusion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and West Austria.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-rooted campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Austria before the attack of Aldin's $700 million.
Aldi prepares the opening up of two distribution centres and the first trade to South and West Austria next year, with up to 120 shops. At the same time Metcash and IGA-supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand through the marketing of power and social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide's show.
IGA's merchants and buyers have jumped along, and brands like the ice cream maker Simmo's, who is coming from Dunsborough, offer a taste in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount-price tickets to Australian football matches to their stockholders.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of his defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware organises the annual investor strategy day.
There is a great deal in the game, because South and West Austria account for almost 30 % of Metcash's IGA trades, with higher profit margins than the IGA network of the eastern states of Metcash.
In South and West Austria, visitors are well known to be cornered, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first move.
In his weekly report to Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open up 30 movements in the south of 25 and the West, which will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in these regions.
Loss of food and food sales and amounts at Metcashi’s high fixed cost base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, with its market share falling from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said during the lunch in Melbourne, that Metcash could possibly be destroyed in the decade.
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comments.
However, it has been understood that last week a member of Metcash's Board would have contacted Douglas.
The market share of IGA has decreased since 2010 from 18 % to 14 %, and returns on Metcashi's food and food business, which is passed on to around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43 % since 2012, indicating a reduction in the debt financing of operations as a result of pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler maintains half, and has invested more than $150 million annually on a weekly basis in lowering prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Wolworths, helping IGA dealers to improve sales by increasing the rate of fresh food, as well as bringing in better choice of private brands.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of sales have increased its attractiveness and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the growth of revenues in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian tennis union, supports Thanas Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered by the recent storm, which has been exaggerating around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own conduct, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union.
“The talented twin named \"Special Ks\", the younger member Kokknakis, was unwittingly released from a case where Kyrgios irritant Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after this, in a hot carbing fight at Cincinnati, the judge had to be separated twice from Kokknakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: \"Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that cocka-
Although the last time Kokkakis was seen breaking up his mail after the crash ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a non-stop defender of the Cokkinaks.
Right now, a young man in Glasgow is competing with Sam Groth in second place in doubles with Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup' semi-final against Britain.
I'm pretty sure that Thana has just been dragged to pieces, Healy said.
He broke his mail when he lost his hook in US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, including in relatively provocative situations with Harrison, U.S. Open and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is well mature when he is 19 years old, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he is practiced firmly, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games beginning on Friday, describing this - a joint decision - a solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberrant's return to the team's stability.
\"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all around [Kyrgios],\" Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, for example, and he grows up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spend some time thinking about these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, under arrest for those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of emanating the flows of migrants coming to the country.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a neutral area and the Serbian authorities responded by shock.
The people who fled the violence of their home countries have now set up their tents and set themselves on the road for an indeterminate period between the inspection stations of the two countries.
However, vanity increased.
While the police helicopter was staying above them, the immigrants were in a hurry to open the border and shouted insults to Hungarian mellow police.
Some refused food and water to be a protest.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that it was unacceptable to accept the return of migrants from Hungary as they received more and more from Macedonia and Greece at all times.
“(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not harming civilians.
The debate must take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels, said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The Sekasorto on the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after the 28 national groups failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of 40 000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers expressed their wish to reach a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extraordinary EU summit to discuss the migration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in the two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and enabled you to be closed and asylum cases to be accelerated.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence at the border with Serbia is complete, the country is also going to set up its anti-Romanian border against Romania to stop immigrants from flooding through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners had been recruited to finalize the barbed fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and the European Union's refugees, many of which are on the run from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not those who are entitled to protection under war - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now determine, as a crime, the company to cross or damage a 4-metre track (13 feet) built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted people.
“As a result of the crisis caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government announces a state of emergency, ” reported the government informant Zoltan Kovacs to journalists in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: crossing the limit of the law is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally accept the action of the military scheduled for next week, but the suppliers of Associated Press at the border have been seeing, for days, heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
The security advisor from the country of Orban, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that 45 people had been captured by the authorities in their attempt to cross the border, as well as more than 15 countries.
They got over the fence by harming the fence, now they're being imprisoned by the police, and they're charged with the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
The Hungarian officials also shut down two of the seven crossing points on Tuesday morning from the border with Serbia after they had sent a train wagon hidden on the wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near the Hungarian Roskea was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office for the treatment of people in the metal container and the crowds came in.
About 20 people got in, but thousands left out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main engines between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse food and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the National survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership Bernie Sandersis has narrowed side
The former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton will continue in a two-digit lead in the democratic appointment race, but Senator Bernie Sanders will catch him.
Clinton now supports 47% of democratic voters (decreased 58%), and the second Sanders support 27% (up 17%).
The vice-president, Joe Biden, has not yet announced whether he will go to the presidential election, but he is in favour of 15% of the Democrats.
More than five months before the opening of the pre-election, most of the democratic voters point out that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who they would vote for.
Clinton's supporters, however, stand tighter behind their own choices than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among a number of population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen slightly.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's premiere in democratic voters under the age of 50 has been destroyed, and he's now on level with Sanders.
But Clinton clearly leads to older voters.
In the last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit century with liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the democratic voters in the country say that they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a candidate for the party.
The fourth says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confused with those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only one quarter would be eager to support him.
In which 48% of Democrats say they would be eager to support Clinton, the Republican One-Man Donald Trump says the same thing about a lesser Republican speaker (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%), and then the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the women's president (13%) and that he was the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice President has an impact on a possible presidential term, 57% of the Democrats would like to see him in the race, even though the third one disagrees.
When asked the Democrats who they would choose second to the party name, Biden is the most popular choice.
For Clinton's supporters, more than half say they'd choose Biden, who's much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue democratic candidates, Hilary Clinton's leadership in Sanders will grow. If Biden goes, the management will be 20%, but if he leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of Democrats believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who keep him the most silent has grown.
When asked democratic voters what was the most important one, however, they brought their opinions ahead of the vote.
In the last month, no Democrats or potential candidates were considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters either.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates will be able to cope well with certain key issues among the voters of their party.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's three best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democrats say that Clinton does not find it honest and reliable, twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally consider that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideally in agreement.
When we look at all these points, about a quarter of the Democrats say that they have no opinion about Sanders.
Although the personal e-mail address of Hillary Clinton and the use of the server in his capacity as Foreign Minister still raises questions, most of the Democrats are satisfied with his explanation and says that the matter did not affect their public opinion about him.
But it's different when you see America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third is pleased.
In March, the people’s opinions were divided shortly after it came to light.
Most Americans say that e-mail polymers did not influence their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
While the voters of Clinton's own party consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32% think he is honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't like Clinton as honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of the total registered voters in the country do not consider Trumpi to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are regarded as good leaders.
Of the six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion of him, just as they do not of Carson.
The error margin for a study involving 351 Democrats is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson will be near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates collected half of all votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for the pedestrian.
Republicans across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% of the CBS survey on the last month's Fox News election on Tuesday to 27%.
Carson, however, rose from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well among the various demographic groups and is distancing Trump among higher-level Republican voters.
The rest of the field have remained behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasichi.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are on level in a third position at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of this latest survey, which took place in September, is +/-6 per cent of the Republican speaker.
Last week's recent CNN/ORC survey published showed Carson to be in a rising survey: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump's 32% above him.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
At Carson's favor last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
We need energy, Trump said last Saturday he was on a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members are charged with the death of the first year student at Baruch College.
Almost two years after the student died in the Brotherhood's chimpusseremony in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains area, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi College in New York City brutally attacked Chun-Michael-Michael-Deng during the membership crisis in September 2013, and then stayed in his hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police noted.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with over a 13-pound bag of sand, after which he was repeatedly beaten to the ground when he tried to walk the ice field through the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head would get hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but, according to the charges, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the network for information on his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood's national chairman Andy Mengi, asking this advice, chief of police, Chris Wagner, at the press conference.
\"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment, and in practice put the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng,\" said Chief of Police Wagner.
Deng didn't get a tuxed up, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly given a boring object blow to his head, body, and travel.
“There have been too many families suffering from brotherhoodism when at least one student died each year as a result of it, from 1970 onwards, Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, stated in his opinion.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The great jury in Monroe County agreed that the first five members would be charged with murdering the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also accused of violent mutilation and of criminal plottion.
If there is an organization behind what has happened that approved the situation, either officially or informally, they should also be held accountable, Mr Wagner stated on Tuesday at a press conference.
The Baruch College denied its connection with the local division by the brotherhood and national brotherhood.
This is the case when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The rise in interest rates will come and the market for rising rates will fall, the returns on bonds will rise and the economy will have to decline.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long this will take or how long it will last.
Pastity does not provide much help in terms of timing, especially in terms of the economy.
The return has lasted only 11 months since the first increase, and sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The US Central Bank’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates has often, although not always, been a determining factor in the way the economy and financial assets react.
This is why US central bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on raising interest rates, but mainly on the trend of the period of normalisation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
At the end of the day, however, market participants may find that all interest-rate restraints have been oversized.
“The first increase after the global economic crisis in the Central Bank will inevitably be interpreted in some areas for the end of the \"bad money\" era, ” said Julian Jessop, a chief economic expert in the global affairs of Capital Economics.
Instead, we do not expect a gradual return to normal, although still low, of the U.S. interest rates is such a mutilating shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some areas of the economy will respond on the basis of past developments:
As seen on the market in the last about a month, waiting for interest rates to rise can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
“It seems that the return on capital has a tendency to stop for a period of 12-24 months after the first increase, possibly reflecting the delay in monetary policy, ” Deutsche Bank’s analysts said in a recent study of what would happen after the central bank’s increase.
More specifically, over the last approximately 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of around 14%, 250 days thereafter, the situation is rather steady (mean increase of 2.6%), and the normal situation has been achieved after 500 days with average returns in the last six cycles of 14.4%, reports in the recent analysis of the leading capital strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management company Bob Doll, published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the raising cycle when the returns start to fall.
These losses are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been previously addressed and can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest level of time before the central bank interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal annual GDP increase in 118 since 1950 is only twice less than 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few think it will remain when the third quarter has gone up by 1.5 per cent, reports the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic position can be risky and the question of whether this time is different may be raised, Deutsche Bank pointed out.
The market participants have made provision for the increase of the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, future trade is only expected to increase by 25%.
Our study shows that since 1950, all growth cycles have so far been having an increasing leverage effect on the supercycles where GDP has passed its pre-decrease peak very quickly after recovery has started, the report says.
On the contrary, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the period of observation.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting far more than ever for the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is 74 months.
The flat-rate return has also been unstable as the market is waiting for interest rate, and the model reminds me of some of the capital findings.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects will be seen more quickly in debt documents than in shares.
The direction of debt returns appears to be changing immediately for the first increase/output of the cycle.
At the end of the interest-cycle, the return on bonds will immediately fall,\" Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategies believe that the increase in interest rates results in a convergence of returns on longer and shorter-term debt instruments, thus a level playing field in return.
The high-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although we are still cautious about finding profit, Schwab's solid return analyst Kathy Jones stated in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to central bank policy expectations.
\"In addition to Doll's strength and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy,\" he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is evener, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its lines.
In general, companies that invest mainly in the USA win interest rates and become more attractive to local products.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt do worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
It shows that 'quality' shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate, and that the analysts from Goldman Sachs noted in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover passed on average five percentage points after the increases in weak turnover in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Businesses with high return on capital and low volatility shares were better achieved than low-quality companies. The first of these were 4 (percentages) and 3 (percentages).
The debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies that owe a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
Even consumers outside the stock market industry have the potential to benefit from the rise in value of the dollar.
Even if experts disagree with how quickly the impact is, the savers can gain profits from higher incomes.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Congressman Andrew Bingham says
Conservative supporter Andrew Bingham is blaming the channel message.
He claims that its separation from the commercial competitor becomes more and more difficult.
He also took the target of the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only imitate the British Awards
Mr Collins, my fellow Member, criticises The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
The BBC Radio 3 is going to become a Classic FM, claiming that the leading representative, adding the pressure of the production company, proves that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Andrew Bingham, the Conservative leader, also told the leaders of the BBC that the public service radio had an impact on the national content and that it was increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
It seems that Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term - the message is turning into the Classic FM, he said.
He also took the goal of the BBC Music Awards game, which was launched last December.
The last year, BBC Music Awards seems only to be under a different name from the British Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly, when you actually just copied something that you already have on the market, Bingham said.
The President of the BBC contested the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is a great deal ahead of his commercial competition partner when it comes to live music and the sharing of information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is in fact a priority.
I also think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works, he said.
Previously this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needed to do more work than before to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC offer that was criticised for entering the toe of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
From the Dutch production company Talpa Media estimated that 22 million pounds were criticised by the Voice, the BBC.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, where Paloma Faith and Boy George function as star judges, is produced in the BBC style.
He added that he wanted to find success inside his own house the next time he started a series of entertainments.
However, he did not agree to prevent future The Voice periods from being produced, or to determine that the money of the consentors would be spent on other forms of entertainment.
Online sales rose to the lowest in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent during the first three months of 2015
Last month there was an increase following the start of low statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that in November Black Friday may control consumption
The act of virtual shopping has grown enormously for over a decade, and many of the British shopping wars have turned into ghost shops.
However, experts say that there are now indications of a level playing field when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
The total consumption of August grew at least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase last year.
Experts say that there are indications of a level playing field when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
“If we look at the growth levels of the previous years and return to the year 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalized over time, ” told Guardian, Andy Mulcahy, supplier of the JMRG sales index.
He explained that three years ago online sales were strengthened when the buyers began using their mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that more people shopped online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it's smoothing down, and (giving) can be reduced.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been regarded as one of the reasons behind the slow-down shops.
Experts believe that consumers are holding back their purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average five times the number of buyers flocked to their computers to pick up shops, pouring out many traders on their websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who made the buyers argue with the findings, can control the shopping process.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one of the five were used online.
With certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made from online shops.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the net instead of using the fashion chains of shopping bags.
The Muslims bury the dead in Meka's pickup accident, the Bin Laden family with sanctions.
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funerals in Meka
Saudi Arabia has partly accused the collapse of a building waste of Saudi Binary Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane fell down.
29 dead were carried through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's big mosaic.
Mostly, the white sufferers filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad course passed the sacred place, where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the Moscian and poured down the worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family to be the victim of a disaster involving 394 people.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers who fell in the big mosaic of Meka were applied through the streets.
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been with his parents before the annual spread-sacred pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the crack of Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that the Binlad Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency in the Arabic version stated that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's leaders were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman swore to find out what caused the fall of the cranes in the yard of the great mosaic, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the later dawn - sanctification held this month.
The Binladin Group has not published reports of the collapse of the cranes and its representatives have not been captured for comment.
The royal decision also accused the association that it did not use up-to-date protective measures and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of pick-ups around the big mosaic of Meka, which are part of a huge build-up led by Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s governing family for decades and will lead to major construction projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel boy whose family denied in the 1990s.
With windy and rainy weather, the rainy weather only took place days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities tell me 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rilia (174 000 pounds) to be paid to the deceased and permanently injured.
The other injured persons will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says that Europeans cheap-working workers are at the bottom of the popularity
The British are increasingly using assistant services, Veronique Laury says.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
The Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened 200 more
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country
Author Ruber Steiner, editor of the city for Daily Mail
The British are told to give up their hammers and paint gloves and to hire more skilled Eastern European workers to do domestic work
It seems that if you're clever with a hammer or you're going to paint walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are increasingly hiring assistants to do tea-se-se-self-work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
The new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home repair chain, Veronique Laury, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a scrupulous price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and to close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work for B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more than one woman's households, where more domestic work is done than before.
Laury said: “The vast majority of our sales staff are still men.
We need to strike a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of buying-in decisions are made by women.
Women have a big role to play in the decision-making process.
Laury is just one of the five women leading up to the British FTSE100 index, and he has restructured his leadership team with equal numbers of male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 % of women are in the group, including its Director General and Financial Director.
Laury said: \"This was a conscious decision - the difference is important here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the board.
Kingfisher reported the bill on both six-months’ income and sales after the group took the cost of closing its stores.
As a result of Trend, Kingfisher owned by Screwfix and B&Q stores is opening 200 new moves
The government of three anaesthetics decided to rely on forced legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were therefore achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other income center organisations began to be forced immediately and, as a result, the country is standing on Friday because of the extensive expression of the employees.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
Let's see if it's worth the strike when it's bad anyway.
Even the resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already reported that they are not going to take part in demonstrations but are going to work.
This would have been impossible for an old consensus.
Of course, there was nothing online to protest in, but the open declaration of riches would have been a small human political suicide.
Millions of professional organisations are protesting with some tens of thousands of people, but it is the cause of thinking.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the harsh solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct heavenly gift.
When things have seemed to be rolling with their own weight for years, the associations are finally able to defend, manifestly and properly defend the rights of the worker.
This is how the government may want to condemn the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
We are no matter what the organizations think about, it is sad that the expression of Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment rises.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Target 8,5 million savings, personnel reduced by 130
The University of Lappeenranta begins a savings course with a view to reducing costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start the y-negotiations for the entire staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing approximately 130 workers.
In addition, two million are being saved.
The 2016 budget, which is expected to be 8.5 million deficits, is in the context of the Yt negotiations.
It is also affected by the cuts in the budget made by the government.
During this financial period, the university will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
Expenditure will grow slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around €85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding at our university is very important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University of Technology.
Before the summer, the effects seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with confidence officers will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to gradually open up to competition.
The first is close-town transport in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After short-distance transport, there will be long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
Ylen will be welcomed to the Ministry of Transport with the plans of Onnibus.
Other international companies have expressed their interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
The central bank of the United States must take decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows from the page when the central bank of the United States meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
When Mrs Reuters asked over half of those who still believed the central bank would raise interest rates last week for 80 economic scientists, they now believe that the situation is not yet solved and that the interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0,25 %.
This is a historic event, because when the central bank cut the interest rates to zero, it will be seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and to start normalising interest rates, said Angel Ubide, the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought balance sheets of dollars and created little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore the less rose global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for lift, but signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before shooting her colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying that she was, in her first murder, hoping that she could cancel it, the authorities told me on Tuesday.
Miss Gautier's police told us that at Delta State University on the road and social science teacher Lamb called emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday, he told me he'd shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send constables to his home.
He said he'd killed his wife last night, and he also mentioned that there's a dog in the house that's, like, no one to interfere with, but he's probably upset.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give me an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, there was the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by a 45-year-old Lamb, saying, \"I'm so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the message Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where she killed the historian Ethan Schmidt before finally killed herself late on Monday when she was surrounded by a police officer.
The head of the university, William LaForge, said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt in his knowledge, but that clearly there was something in Lamb's mind:
On Tuesday, the authorities said that, despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb would have believed Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, there was no law, no evidence or information, no form of any kind of third-party violence.
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a good person.
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but he stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentis had a 19-year-old daughter who's, uh, upset.
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were the best friends they ever had.
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked in his home manually online. Sun Herald stated that Knowles was a close friend to Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
He always wanted to help other people.
The police told Lamb that she called her relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them she's not going to jail.
When the police caught Lamb on highway 1, near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped her car by the side of the road, left it there and ran into the forest where she shot herself.
Lamb argued about educational science in Delta State in spring 2015, says a CV found on the university’s website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he had leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this, indeed, requires its taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture in his right leg when Manchester United lost his PSV Eindhoven in the league of the Masters.
Even though the defenseman remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would be able to play again this period.
The injury caused Héctor Moreno's reckless cover by 15 minutes after a 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the area of PSV.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and had to give him oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, \"He's got a double fracture in his leg, and now he's in the hospital.
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe the day after that, and then he'll be cut in Manchester.
This is terrible, and the boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, suffers from difficulties, and then plays great, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing a oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it'll take at least six months for a double fracture, and he won't play part stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got the red card and the punishment shot.
Ertuomar Nicola Rizzoli did not rank a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested an Italian actor was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged hitch.
Shaw was saying, \"Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger,

An English defender has an additional incentive to recover next June European Championships in France.
PSV Coach Phillip Cocu said: \"It's a very bad injury.
If a player comes out for this kind of injury, everyone's very sad.
The goal of our players is never to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played in the Mexican team Van Gaal Holland against the 2014 World Cup.
\"Moreno takes this hard because the aim is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's bad,\" Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's hitch.
Moreno said to SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smodeling's challenge.
You think David Cameron knows Lorax better than this?
Each parent will soon learn something: If your child loves a book, it will not last long before it learns almost from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children’s book, the holiday - care service, he chose Dr. Seussin The Lorax, the environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company and continues: \"A fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or message that we have never seen before –
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the story, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details were added to complete the rather short original text.
\"In the town of Tarville, where all nature has been lost, and even the air is for sale, Ted hopes he can overcome the girl's dreams by filling Audrey's desire to see the right tree, the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss died in 1991, from the right name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, not written.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, the Cameron text sounds like it was taken in places on the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database website, which starts as follows: \"In the town of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, Ted hopes he can win his dreams on the heart of Audrey's girl,
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be such an unscrupulous plot of the book. In it a young, anonymous boy hears how local nature has destroyed greedy, wood-slapping, and supplies of tissuey Kerskanen, without any mention of the short, musty creature named Lorax, who says for trees,
This relatively invisible PR task is probably addressed to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister said that the text must have come from Cameron's district office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at that moment.
Adam Lyth was obviously in danger of being sidetracked by the British team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what a team England has chosen for the tour, I do not think that the re-energisation of the last 3-0 serial loss is likely.
I wouldn't close the guest win off the bills.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it includes good spinners and team thinking is strong: they have no scars in 2012, only a young positive.
Moeen Ali develops in his circulatory feeds and Adil Rashid is an attack option, although there is an unknown factor on this level.
Related to: Adam Lyth dropped from the UK Cricket Team, his replacement becomes Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is clearly difficult for me to analyze because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and simple but the bear truth is that Cricket players are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the newsletter, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About 100 points more and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes in.
The British head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not perform as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me. Lyth is, above all, a team leader.
It's hard to answer the question of how long the hitter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play at home and at the guests.
The only point of appeal is that England first chose Jonathan Trott to the Caribbean, when Lyth was in peak condition, but that lost opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He's got something we saw earlier in Yorkhir during this period when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this, of course, depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a balled idea of Moeen in a shot at Cook, where an extra pitcher would be placed but four quick ones could be kept, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed man has already proved himself to be quite a crack player.
Moen did not necessarily do his job in the province of Worcestershire, but he is a third for them, and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games at the first slow before moving to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be on the team as a thief, and, little of what I've been dealing with him, she seems very impressive from a young man.
People can look at his undefeated statistics - beating an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think that it is a gamble, but there are not too many pitchers and voters who chose young people.
He'll learn a lot with this tour.
Outside the team in England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach's side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan Scratch Jayawarden as a consultant in the games can prove to be a genius.
He's one of the nicest friends in the game, and he brings with him an enormous amount of experience because he's done everything in all the situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes along with the white ball and brings both energy and an unrelenting surprise.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in the international crisis, whether it was playing or coaching, and he has the same exploiting intelligence as the Mahala.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, rested on a single day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, trainers and elected people do not make timetables.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a lighter basis.
Britain’s departure from the EU (Brexit) can take advantage if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-sighted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing growing problems every day, even if it does not even take into account the hearty Jeremy-Isn's choice to lead the Labour Party or to an organization of trade unions in Europe on Tuesdays.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyni and Nigel Farages.
Recently, the European diplomatic partner explained that, given that the EU is in so deep a range of crises, not all of which are its own reasons, some Member States are tired of a British self-focused agenda full of concessions and disturbing contractual changes that these countries most do not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the central trade union organization decided that it would not want them if they were to undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George a self-evident agent.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without the local eyepiece, and then come home to say that they will win the supporters for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward to the inside of the British EU Hotel - - don't leave us alone with France - - in Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care about us then leaving.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave it to be ruined in the same way as it had been to Thatcher for too long (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also the driving force.
Poland may soon have a national right-wing government, Spain being left-wing.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for selfieberts, if their energy were to be used instead to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend shows, some of these ministers may even be consciously planning to make useless remarks about the Scottish National Party style during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
The renegotiations were organised, and the renegotiations were of no importance to Britain.
Europeans have had a rough experience of how the Fleet Street newspaper is involved and how the EU-sceptic press's sovereignty is, what they weren't inspired by Tony Benn at the time of the 1975 referendum, when our membership began in 1973 became stronger at 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made the name for themselves by writing for themselves - from direct EU bananas - when he was a writer in Brussels in the early '90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of tax-loving freaks, foreign people who hacked phones, and people who have their registered office elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought about them exactly the same, but realized that if you were in a cage with a passionate gorilla, the bananas would have to be given up because of the lightning if you didn't want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and then at dinner.
As a matter of fact, Miliband was more blarish than Blair himself, as regards the fight against Cameron's renegotiation, and it was in fact the principle behind the rejected constitution of the EU, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Blair the status of exit.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in the Westminster House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-enacting Neil Kinnock's '80s boycotting Murdochi' strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he still needs to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not to me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whose BBC-shot Corby left on Sunday.
Corby's official position in Europe is, to say, evolving.
He says he would like us to remain in the renewed EU.
Well, most of the people of the United Kingdom's Independence Party outside Ukip's war painting and the Conservative Party's most illustrious nationalists can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary-Benn, but not Benn-fani- Benn said this both on radio and on TV this week, when his inner Boy Scout would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint a box of John McDonnell as a shadow government minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law was on TV trying to be unfaithful to his colleagues in the Labour Party without going so far as to lose his seat of government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But the fight for us to remain involved in any situation, in which the statement by Benn, was not what McDonnell said, nor, in conclusion, what Corby told the principals and the representatives of the people at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever it is, it is an unscrupulous, emotional and personal image that Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of the 24-hour TV, and especially in social media, which is a suitable growth platform for paranoids and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron an air ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep the Labour Party in support of the referendum campaign for himself for himself.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, McDonnel and Corbyn's basic tour of EU membership (and therefore in line with their Benn-oriented economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate on the issue of left-wing thinkers who are the key to the narcissism of small differences in drug narrations.
With regard to his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin be in a position to waste political capital (even for those who have suspicious voters) in favour of Britain when it can be completely unnecessary?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed with the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the presence of a Conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England's electric tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the State-funded agency's claim that the electricity tobacco is 95% less harmful than traditional ones had begun a 12-person meeting involving some of them in the tobacco industry.
The experts who wrote to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet with the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in his report on electric tobacco.
In the last month, PHE published this report, describing it as a comprehensive review of the evidence.
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In the last month, the medical journal Lancet published a ledger attacking the base of the PHE’s main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in BMJ have considered whether the claims were built on a rock or sand.
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell, say: \"The main principle of public health is that methods of action must be set up for proven effectiveness:
They say that the public is waiting for the best estimate of PHE's claim that electric tobacco is about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco, based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a meeting of one 12 people, which developed the multi-criminal approach (MCDA) to synthesis their opinion on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director was told that he had previously received funding from the British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he said had received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they will increase.
The selection criteria for panel members are not stated, but the panel includes several well-known electric tobacco supporters, some of which also report that they have received funding from the sector.
Others who have been present are not well known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco director.
The study produced by the group - in many words admits that there is a lack of evidence regarding the disadvantages of most of the products and most of the criteria - are written by McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that there is no evidence that the electric tobacco works on the road to smoking in children or non-smokers.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of PHE's health and well-being, says that the arguments put forward by BMJ have previously been answered.
He says: “The tobacco is much less harmful than smoking.
Half of those who burn their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence appears and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public awareness of the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die every year of tobacco-related illness and smoking costs NHS $2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though electric tobacco are not riskless, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
I think it'd be a good idea for BBC to give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 Director
The former Channel 4 president, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would give anything - from such sands as from this soap show on Albert Square street.
Mr Johnson said that permit payments should only be used to produce programmes that are not carried out by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public-service programmes that are likely to be smaller in the public sector, difficult times for its competitors to see the most popular programmes and channels such as BBC4.
After Tony Hall, the director of the BBC, said that the company wanted to work more with other organisations, Johnson said that he was able to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years at the time of Channel 4, in vain.
\"I do not understand the idea that the BBC will produce and send programmes that would clearly match the non-substantial competitors,\" said Johnson, as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If the permit fee is withheld - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this media or for the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is sent to the most important missionary time, because it is wanted to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea of no one else showing the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: “I do not understand why the aggressive tax should be financed by programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders another, without denying the implementation within the house.
Directly, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't see how it's about sending a public service.
I don't think that would weaken BBC at all.
Channel 4 – a serial entrepreneur who led the 2004-2010 – said that BBC is responsible for hunting audiences, and because they believe that this is the best way to achieve long-term support -
He commented on the most popular series in BBC, which resembles the comments made by former Sky leader Tony Ball, who used his MacTagart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC sells series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC’s smaller public service programmes are going to BBC4 where there is often no audience rate, but BBC thus meets its responsibilities and can then, in defence of 4 billion pounds of permit receipts, it is hypocritically stated that 'you know, we are doing all these unknown programmes that no one sees'.
They'll put them on a mission where no one will ever come to see them.
Concerning the permit fee, Johnson said to the committee: “I am calling for you to find a more aggressive system in who gets the most value from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds per year is worth a lot, but I don't know if it's gonna hold its place for people who have $150 worth of money because they don't use BBC much.
The former Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also proved to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-examine its early mission to Reith to inform, train and entertain:
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as training - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should be taken as a model for Australia and Canada's broadcasts and changed the role of data reporting, validation and entertainment.
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which, according to him, only some are displayed on TV, and join with commercial companies so that they can be viewed online.
Its ability to control the brain cells through audio waves
The video shows how the shuttle cams change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them with sound waves.
Small-scale shuttle worms change direction as soon as they get hit by a sound pulse that's too high to hear the human ear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasonic-responsible membrane channels.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms indicate the performance of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Researcher Sreekant Chalasani at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep-braining, an invasive measure leading to electrical pulses in the brain of people to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The shuttle worms do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasan discovered that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles confirmed ultrasonic waves that then entered the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4-ion furnaces, structures that are in the cell membranes of some worms.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the attached cells, reports the report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic-controlled shuttles, Chalasan genetically modified worms so that some of their business nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasan used ultrasonically modified worms, microscopics strengthened the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they connect the modified nerve cells.
The process has some of the same features as optogenics, a career tool that allows scientists to switch on and off nerve cells by using light pulses.
However, Chalasi says that the use of sonogenetics can have some advantages compared to optics.
Unlike the light that must be sent from an optical fiber along the desired point of the brain, ultrasonic waves of low speed can pass through the tissue without barrier, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
\"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it may be possible to obtain the target human nerve cells temporarily to respond to the ultrasonic signal in certain neurological treatments in the clinical setting,\" Chalasan said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Horrible killer machines!

The happy voice and comical language of the cartoons do not leave any doubt that this advertising of the world's largest art fairs is a sharp parade produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the willingness of the British Government to trade weapons to lottery governments at the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre in the London shipyard area of London.

As a result of a separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and metro trains requiring more attention.

In September, a pack of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the weapons fair.
These 300 posters were made by artists who had worked at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (The Museum of Public Designs).
The collection called Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London using the \"Ad Space Hack Packs\" packages.

According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex magazine, Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists at the resistance front when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster greets business travelers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed through Facebook over the last 24 hours for more than 100,000 times. It created a free advertising agency VCCP, and also a graphic designer and background browser worked for free.
VCCP's Creative Director Matt Lerer found that the weapons fair was not advertised at all - and the ExCeL calendar was also empty at the time - and thought: \"Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid.
They played with the idea of a more realistic commercial of spider-like corporation, but it was more stopping to stress the matter with bright colors and animation.
\"They've done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fairs,\" says Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in the art fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when actors shop fantasticly decorated products.
He's got a press release order from the U.S. Army, an AT4CS RS trigger.
This includes a \"advanced tube-injection hatch, which targets excellent effects behind the tank within the target\".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student apartment
It's been 11 years since I was ignorant when I moved to the student apartment when I was 19 and I still believed in the barettes and moral relativisms, but only now I remember the crowds of smiles and numerous long complaints of people I've given up.
A large part of what I learn can be summed up to eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment can be absolutely scary if anything happens to the nerves.
It's tempting to say where you're from, whether you're in the middle of the year and where you're thinking about Corbyn, and why I really don't love you or hate Marmite because it's really nothing but a gloomy thing to find me in my room.
Just breathe.
And also help others pull the spirit - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, and not the people you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they'll share quenches.
Give people room.
People's rooms are often turned into cocktail parties, movie-scrapers, and over-scrapers, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.

Your room should be a resting place, but in many housing areas there is a culture of walking from one room to another, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friends.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say, \"I care about you, and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you about,
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
A guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some pretty good stuff.
You'll be friends by bakeing.
Since you're starting the university at the peak of the bakery, knocking on human doors with a chocolate cake plate and showing yourself seems to be somewhat less strange, less welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something to you, now smile when I ask you personal questions... From the '50s.
It's a great way to make friends.
Your partners may feel obliged to talk, and they may continue to connect your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on how to cook.
Poorly mixed flour sugar fatty acids probably only make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
I understand stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a tip of milk for your tea?
Ask the owner of the milk.
It's perfectly possible that they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathies, but try to take it more grown-up than my housemate who mixed the laundry in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You're not supposed to talk so people can't sleep or study.
It's not just that you're a decent person, it's because you're like that proverb that you're playing the pot.
The girl in my hall asked her neighbor if they could play their drama and bass music down later because it was three in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally silenced at 5:00 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before she put her own music on the ground, locked their doors and left for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or, reversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you considered a roommate to be your next spouse, beat yourself together, split up, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your friends together to him.
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot apartment partner is not really your future mate, you might even try to talk sense to your underside.
In the exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left his keys in his locked room, the border between playing and bullying is thinner than it does.
The good guy's funny, but he'll be back in no time.
You can give useful and fun teaching safety by hiding something, but never mess with someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock down their doors and drop the keys to the glass of water you put on the freezer, but don't put their property on the blue bar as high as twice.
Racist attack on Kitee - House designed for reception in Salo
On Saturday morning a racist blow was made to the residence of foreign students in Kitee, northern Karelia.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation of minor asylum seekers but the sleep facilities of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period, says Heidi Lukeen, a teacher of the Kite Evanelinen folk school.
The windows and walls of the public college accommodation were pushed with racist signs, such as carvings, and a metal object was thrown through a single accommodation window, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luke, as a responsible teacher of youth guarantee education, there were estimated ten people at the time of the attack in the building under vandal control.
\"There was a weekend and there were adults who were free to move, so some could be elsewhere,\" Luke says.
The National School has accommodation in 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in a connected building have a status.
Some study in adult education, some in vocational studies, and some study Finnish, ” Luke says.
A status is a permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finnish police are investigating the attack as a damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, students received an information conference on Monday, with the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had foreign students for another decade, and this is the first time something like this happens,\" Luke says.
Luke says the mess's already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have had at least three men and had been on the move with a light passenger car.
I think this is the end of the youth weekend when this topic has been on the ground.
Nothing more serious, Luke says.
There's also been a hospital in Salo with a designated reception centre.
It happened last week.
He told me about it on his website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall had a carvingist drawn and written in English “You are not welcome ”
There's been a criminal record for the police.
Amendment 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected information on the age and status of the persons living in the building, given by the police.
The state will break down the Y train to the Karjaa - passengers in their filth, the old idiot countries -
The Y train from Helsinki to Karjaa from Raasepor will cease to run in March.
The news was agitated by passengers rising from the beginning of the train at Helsinki Main Railway Station.
In particular, there is a downward attack on the islanders, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's very idiotic because the number of residents is growing all the time, and the workplaces need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be up to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on a video interview with HSTV he'll be coming on a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
H- and R-trains running on the main track are connected to the new R-line.
Purola's position in Järvipää and Nuppylinna in Tuusula is absent.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes the Ministry of Transport to buy train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period varies year-on-year and the end-of-year routes are all over the country.
The new four-year agreement in autumn will be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a Siuntiian, considers that the state of the train cutting is a short-sighted operation.
We are making the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y train is also used by people other than the Raaseporians and the Siuntio people, because it is fast and bypasss several positions.
On the train, the Espolainen Annina Pöyry was agitated by the fate of travelers from the urban area.
“It is especially sad for those who have to redesign their journey, ” he said when he was on the Y train.
A little relief is in place.
I think a new train connection to the beach track is coming to replace the Y-jun in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, i.e. to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities and taxpayers in the region.
“We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices, ” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year on the Y train, the Ministry has paid much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves two positions between us.
Instead, in Ainola and in the sauna kallio the number of train lines will double.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease in the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys rail traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keurou and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinajoki.
The Piesämäki Joensuu route is reduced to the Pieksämäki route.
The trains are reduced along the routes of Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips are made in permanent shifts a year, with some nine million journeys being purchased in total by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million per year to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on the state of the capital: \"It is worth studying for Marx.
The global economic crises have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his conclusions from 1867 to 1894 in the capital, writes the current status of the capital of Marx in the book Yrjö Hakane, the former President of GDP.
He'll be taken more seriously now than long ago. Hakanen will write in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the evolution, internationalisation and intrusion of capitalist economies have proved to be amazing for all areas of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of capital and imaginary capital.
The list of the capital seminar-based books organised by Hakasen is also published in Aalto University, Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected economic operator.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's being a topical girl and forever,
However, it is not the former Managing Director of the Institute of Economic Research and Economic Affairs, is it Marxian?
No, no, no, no.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather as an interesting society theory.
Today, social sciences have become diverse and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economicist, journalist, political agitator and lesson in literature.
The common idea is that the atheory tells us about the wrong opinions of the dead men, Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions of capitalism from the early season too far, Korkman wondered.
But Korkma sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
\"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked me some good questions,\" he says.
Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth, are now being discussed again.
“Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a large picture, as a result of a technical upheaval, to a changing world, ” he analyses Korkma.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't helping Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Korkman thinks he should be familiar with it.
\"In the '70s Marx couldn't read,\" Korkman says.
\"The Mao and the Trotski people and the other sects hated all capitalism, but even more so,
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political pressure on the back years.
Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like any other classics, says Korkman.
The UN calls on war offenders in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamils.
The civil war in Sri Lanka is estimated to have died at least 100,000 people.
There is no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major armed attack in the last months of the long war should be properly investigated in 2009, and the UN report calls for.
Sri Lankan armed forces report on torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, as likely as men as women.
According to the report, rebels have committed themselves to coercion of minors and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intended to organise an investigation itself, but it does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice as foreign judges.
In the Yoo-Kennia trial, he was able to put his social media on the table.
The syksy student books had a long foreign language on Wednesday, which most of them had English.
More than 16,000 volunteers tested their English skills.
The test could have written a substance on social media.
Based on its own experience, it was necessary to consider whether the social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the article of 150-250 words in English may have been shown to the editor of the website’s advisory gallery.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for Finnish Leelia resting chair.
He had to ask how parents should look at things from the point of view of young people too.
The total amount of the substance was four, one of which had to be selected.
“It was the hardest of them, ” estimated the third topic by Mia Lybeck, a Swedish-language high school in Porvoo.
The third issue was just a sitat from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, Lybeck said it was nice.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
- At least in our school we've been practicing to write speeches, Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment as normal.
During a test in Finland - or in Swedish - we were able to answer questions about texts that, for example, called for the adaptation of the summer chamber to climate change and the processing of large information masses.
On Wednesday, a small amount of Russians were also written (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The articles of autumn continue on Friday, when there is an experiment of another domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In upper secondary schools, the test is normally carried out, i.e. the expression of the employees does not affect it.
The Board of Studies invites experimentants to find suitable transport connections in time for them to get to the test.
Even more time can be given if it can be shown that the delay did not result from lack of care.
The shop in Oulu was robbed with a gun on it.
In Oulu, Wednesday morning the shop was robbed in the town of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and was wearing a commando box covering his face.
He's a normal body and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating this as a gross robbery.
Police are preparing to arrive at tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland
The government's anti-circumvention demonstration will be blocking the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary reports, up to tens of thousands of people may arrive.
The members of the SAK, A Plan and STKK associations will meet at Rautatientor at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in demonstrations.
In turn, the police at work are not only responsible for the tasks of alarming and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the giant expression.
Roads to the train sensor shall be closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30 a.m. to 14.
Only alarm vehicles will be released in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from the traffic circle of Kaisaniemi, from the western direction of Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, it seems to be enough.
I'm not taking a stand for police struggles.
Helsinki, according to Kujala, is coming to Finland because of the demonstration of mentality.
The police won't tell us the exact number of patrols.
There's a lot of coming, but basically we're gonna be fine on our own, Kujala says.
The police are asking to avoid private caring in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic gap extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to early evening.
With protesters arriving from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them to the Rautatientor.
Buses are, as a matter of fact, a long way away.
The rest of the trip then has to walk to the scene of protest, Kujala tells me.
The expression of the mind also stops the public transport in Helsinki.
From the police' point of view, there's a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large gatherings, is now taking care of itself.
The demonstration organisers have informed the police that tens of thousands of government opponents in economic policy may be in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the expression of mind to go smoothly.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are reasonable and peaceful, says Kujala.
On Friday, local demonstrations are also held in different parts of Finland.
In many ways, the expression of Friday's mind is exceptional - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations of mind?
The great expression of mind organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiinen, Professor of Sociology of Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Sisitainen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's strong ideas are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here to make sure that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, mirrors are needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
This new division is now the sharp distribution that the expression of mind will bring about among those who would be willing to take part in the demonstration.
Unemployed persons who met across Finland showed their views at Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you were looking for a reference point for a Friday's demonstration, it could be a huge demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorsta, 1993, says Siisiinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorsta gathered 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (centre) government is complicating from the labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as that of the Ahon portvari government.
Now, perhaps even worse between the government and the Ay movement than the time of Murrostorsta.
Furthermore, Finland is now very powerful in the history of the Portuguese Government, Sisisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in that way that it is so strict in spite of the basic Finnish speeches.
At that time, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protestors are expected on Friday.
The expression of the mind also stops public transport and possibly closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive the unallocated support of employees, it can become the largest in years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year in recent years.
They're on the edge.
Traditionally, Finnish ay movement's demonstrations have been quite peaceful - although the way things have been going down in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is subject to law.
The mindmakers are trying to avoid damage to or destruction of property, says Sisinen.
The late 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes, among other things, by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikees and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical ceiling in the 1970s
The most important strike in the 1970s was the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and power strike in 1977.
The metalman strike was attended by 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended after seven weeks after the strike was presented by the Conciliation Committee.
Metal men got a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 electricity ceiling lasted 49 days and caused electrical shocks all over the country.
Murrostorist in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people met in the Parliamentary House, many of them as unemployed, to show their minds in favour of the work.
Firemen strike three months in 1998
The firemen strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless it was the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in egg smoke in the protests of farmers against the EU in 1994.
“Siberia teaches, the EU quits, there was one of the attacks.
For Espa, farmers took tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hayballs in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995.
The nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
Last time they were in the strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was painted by some deaths during the strike.
Make your threats to the strike and the mass transplants of nurses in 2007.
In the end, the negotiations accelerated the threat of mass migration.
Doctors lacquered 2001
- Doctors in the strike - for the escape - included a strike clause for law enforcement doctors in 2001.
The municipal health centre and hospital doctors’ strike lasted five months and brought about a lively debate on how law enforcement can jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students marching for student support in Helsinki from the Senate Hall to Parliament Hall in 2013.
Central Crime Police to find out the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to identify the backgrounds of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and main responsibility are at the event site in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more likely to experience a more fatal impact.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died apparently by choking.
According to the General Radio, which first told the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company conducts, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign-based, 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for the smuggling of human beings.
Captain, ex-conspirator of the refugees and upskirt businessman - story of five smugglers.
Upporid king of smugglers, violent boat driver, an elegant missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks himself to be a good guy.
Such people, for example, engage in human trafficking in the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of trento, and a journalist, Gampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their clients, and their book Death Travel Office will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the lonkers of trafficking in human beings, present suggestions for solutions and present smugglers at different stages of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them off right now.
The Kikenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunishans are heading there for summer entertainment.
On behalf of their location, islands are also excellent for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometers.
Because of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, the captain who burns in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kikenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
It is done by Emir on a blue, ten-metre tree, hundreds of times already.
If I'm going to fill the ship's feathers, I'm going to put 40 people in it.
One trip to Emir makes about 8 000 euros after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for her clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunishers wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis came again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Island in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as he can see.
Food is given in such a way that customers just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the client is out of money, it is their problem.
We're going out to the water at midnight with a quenched lantern.
The first night we drive off the island, then stop, wait the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the high waves of 20 metres passengers weep and vomit.
At the destination, human cargo has been landed in half an hour and Emir leaves for a return trip.
Emir wants to be scared.
That's why he beats up his clients, and at least claims he's gonna beat up the hangers' lives.
He says in the book that when the police suddenly caught him, he threw all his passengers across the side and told them to swim to the nearest island.
\"I took the clients out of the neck one by one, and I threw them over the edge,\" says Emir in the book.
The most irony passengers are coming from the southern side of Sahara.
I hear that his countrymen have to take this to heart.
I'm gonna beat them off right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular cab driver in Bogojiša, Serbia.
His cab's not very good, the starter's been pulling in the last few days and, by the way, it's seen his best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at the top and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogojisha is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
Near the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their family will stay in tents, ponds and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
The forest also includes families who have not submitted asylum applications for reasons or for others to Serbia.
Some also live in private homes, but it is a public secret.
From among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walking in a difficult country, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arrived in the Bogojisha area, on the knot of the great trafficking in human beings, the people are dying tired.
The people of Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians. He'll tell you in the book.
They say it once, and that's enough, Goran.
He said the Africans are trying to make a move.
That's not what Goran likes.
You've got a stupid loo all the way.
The first agreement is a price of EUR 300, then they count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses he's a nice, kind-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he works at a cheaper rate than the others and that he or she has to pay for the Hungarian border for only 50 euros.
There are three hundred kilometres of the trip, most of which are comfortable on the highway.
I hear colleagues ask for three or four times the price.
Goran deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a big deal for the smuggler, but in Serbia it's a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and he takes his passengers off the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and cheers away.
In the Work of Proverbs
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary embassies, and that's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many Christians who have fled Congo, as well as a small center to help the Congolese refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks to do the work of mercy.
It's important to look good to the missionary.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and takes care that the white calf’s rubber strip scours gently under the low belt of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his underground car and three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and from Europe.
At first, the customer calls some of the five telephone numbers of the Consignor.
He advises that it be worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in a whiff, and that it blends with merchants across the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee status to the Ugandan authorities, we must tell them that we have come from, for example, North Kivu war areas, and that we have had to flee from their home violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity card will be destroyed and another one will be obtained.
That will help the Missionary Officer's contacts with the Ugandan police.
After this, the customer is directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum, NGOs, the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows red tape because he himself has become a refugee to Uganda.
He will charge each gate separately: the submission of an application to the Ugandan police will cost about 100 euros, the delivery of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process, for example, to some European countries, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice-creams
Tom's a start-up smuggler, a former drug dealer.
Fourty-six Irish call on the French coast in Calais, where his work is to load people into the streets on the way to Britain.
He's got an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know he's in the human secret transport business.
At night Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from some nearby downtown Calais.
They're driving A26, trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would have to go directly to prison for illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The cab stops, Tom and his clients running across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before they continue to cross the canal across the Britts.
Tom chooses a suitable truck to make sure it's on his way to England, not even the Netherlands, and cuts the line between a safety-belt and a safety-belt.
It's gotta be done quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom will wrap his client in an aluminium foil, the same one that is wrapped in a kitchen around a fryer or an oven potato.
It's supposed to stop the police's thermal scanner from seeing the hideout.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom's leaving his client's truck, and he's out of town hoping that you don't have to go on a shady ride, at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
Upporical Turkish is called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal land in the Mediterranean that controls sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, the Cyçuk has been working and has constantly developed new ways of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage vis-à-vis other entrepreneurs: he only needs the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury cruise: Turkish ports are leased according to entertainment shops to take Americans or European families to tourist trips for a few days.
The reality is that ships are loaded to the Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported from Istanbul to one of the ports and from there to sea in Europe against a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls until they leave.
I'll get people into minibuss and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we have to get on board quickly.
Passengers have to stay hidden under deck.
The guard can only observe how deep the ship is, for no other sign of the human population is visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and throw up, the better.
Küçuk receives about 53 000 euros from one luxury trip after the cost.
He does not deal with practical things himself, but employs captains, recruiters, guards, captors and other smaller factors to take care of the work in turn.
During the summer season transports are organised for at least hundreds of people and millions of people make money.
He is thought to have bought land through undercover companies, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Mr Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical industry.
He must have disappeared since then.

American Olympics in their book Disorder and Prostitution
Three times at the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 500-metre runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl's book, Favor Hamilton tells about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published some bitter books on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the race in peak condition and ran in the cartilage for the second best time.
In the finals, however, he panicked.
At the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position on the ground run.
However, at 150 meters before the goal, his strength was subdued.
He fell on the track surface, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself across the finish line, Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Fabor Hamilton suffered from a double mood disorder.
His brother, Dan, had done a year before Sydney’s race to commit suicide, and he himself felt tremendously successful.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There was no economic problem, but he was delighted by the idea of having money to have sex with strangers.
He also overreacted with his husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's cab was 450 euros per hour.
He tells me that he spent the money on his luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of being a prostitute was also that he needed adrenaline scale similar to that he had won in his competition for public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from a double mood disorder.
The double life of the former spirit came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was in the world's statistical community at 1,500 metres, at 3.57.40, but remained the last one at the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was glad when the union put the Norwegian ski resort in hand:
The Norwegian ski club Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability, in the opinion of at least one of its colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have, like the last year of the summer and autumn, turned into a sports agreement.
Although Northug has been offered a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the world champion and the Olympic champion.
As a result of the dispute, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to close Northug out of the future World Cup.
The decision received thanks for the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski resort under control.
Thank you for showing me the spine, Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor, he continued.
The dispute between Norway and Northug is about money.
Apparently Northug would like to be part of a period of national team so that he can advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations, and will not give one athlete to the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that Northug has been given economic and other privileges for many years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own release in which he assured himself that he wanted to be brave in Norwegian colors during the next season of World Cup, as well as after World Cup and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MMs, two of which are gold.
He was involved last winter in the team that won the media gold.
The racing day of pasturers is also celebrated in the North
On the 25th day of the race, there will be a set of paces in various restaurants and shops that have been granted the shield of the Paist translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-level food skills and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants checked and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of the increased sense of the thyroid and organization.
In the northern part of the day the restaurant is held in Vaasa in Fondiks and Kantareliks.
In Kokkola, there is a restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events that will take place in different parts of the world within the same day.
Finland will continue to be the host country.
Kahajoki newspaper: Appeals to the Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of the Kahava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of Kauhava’s ex-space currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area is still permanently located in the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is in the hands of the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Special Networks Oy.
According to the Kajokoki newspaper, the placement of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in connection with the area and airport of the former Airport School, whose impact has also not been explained in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
The article states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
It has been discussed, among other things, by Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
The Ombudsman is told by a private person that the complaint is not a question of the principle of the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned location in the former military area is wrong.
The Kahava City Government dealt with the reception centre issues last Monday.
Niinistry: The situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented in the evening to journalists after meeting with the chairmen of all parliamentary parties in Mänttyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were shared by all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland the government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in times where we face great challenges
The so-called ‘Syria’, as well as Russian and US activities in the region, may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistries are desirable in terms of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive way, namely the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the report, the NATO issue was also ignored in the discussions.
In the labour market situation, the President did not take a stand.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights, start off for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia states that the operations of airports are intended to be carried out by the commanding forces during the stop-of-work.
However, there are safety checks and other service points that are expected to be affected by such delays and delays.
The demonstration closes the streets of the centre of Helsinki
Friday's demonstration closes the streets of the Helsinki Centre.
The police tell us that the streets leading to the Rautatientor are closed from the cars around 9:30-14.
There are no cars allowed from the direction of the Mannerheims in the direction of Kaivokata, Postikatu and the Gulf of Work towards the railway station.
The direction of Hakaniemi from the Union road is directed to the Union Street in the context of the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people taking part in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles shall be allowed to enter the area.
Metro and Ratty Drivers in All Friday's demonstration of mind
Metro and tram drivers take part in the demonstration of Friday from the beginning of the morning traffic to the end of the night traffic.
The Raitio and Metro staff association told STT about it tonight.
Most of the Alps are closed for two hours, including mail closed
Friday’s demonstration also causes disturbances for Post’s services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, to distribute day mail.
The majority of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is handled despite the strike.
The aim is also to manage food transportation and hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
You can obtain information on the situation on the services on the Post website.
Most of the Finnish Alps close their doors on Friday for two hours.
Pam, the Trade Union of Services, has instructed its employees to suspend their work between 11 and 13.
Pam has also called on day-care workers to participate in professional demonstrations.
SOK's and Kesko's representatives tell Helsingin's Sanitaries that the stores are to be kept open, if necessary, by the commanding forces.
According to Kesko, the possible closure of individual stores is not yet known.
The day-care centres in Helsinki are partially closed
The day-care centres in Helsinki are not fully operational on Friday, informs the Helsinki Early Education Agency.
Due to professional demonstrations, day care is possibly concentrated in certain day care centres, and day care is not organised by day care centres and playgrounds.
Day-care centres and groups of developing disabled and disabled children remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of developing disabled and autistic schoolchildren will be carried out normally.
The Agency's authorisation to notify the changes to its activities will be updated tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Take a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio calls are one channel among others.
Such direct talk channels will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipiba did not wish to assess yet how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio calls would become.
According to the Sipilä, speech may not always be forwarded to Ylen channels in the future.
If other channels are reported to be a channel, then we'll see.
We're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the economic situation in Finland is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to be made to the public.
This dossier, which is now being discussed, is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The call will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
Take a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's TV speech will not be about turning the government in.
Is it an effort to take more strictly into account the right to define a public debate and to refuse a public debate on the questions raised by Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm?
The Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin recently commented that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to be defined.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be connected.
It is understood that the commercial media is nervous about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting issues in democracy.
It is the responsibility of the media to make a specific effort to ensure that the political agendas are not taken into account.
It says that TV calls are a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations put on the table.
Is there more that we've heard today?
Or can he speak differently, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if the promise is just the same as the old one, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
Ylekin takes this risk in the sense that, if this is not a specific situation, it is a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be identified as a message from politicians or parliament and government, which will certainly not be in the interest of Ylen or in the general direction.
Sliding the door bet
In the future talk, it is also important what the Prime Minister leaves without saying, and the media researcher stresses.
Tonight you will have to look closely to what Sipilä is missing and to what it is not, says Heikki Kutti, research coordinator of Jyväskylä University.
The six say that TV is a smart bet from Sipi, because this is how this gets us to get his own view out of the ringtone.
This will give a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at an information conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The sympathies pass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that there is something wrong with the media, because no specific questions can be asked.
The moon says it's very important to see how Sipilä goes on TV... if the sweats run out, if your hands shake.
He compares Sipi to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good point, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to be informed about something, because here man is as if he speaks directly to another person.
This is what (President Barack of the United States) Obama and his partners regularly engage in.
It's very exceptional.
Mr Erkka Railo, a political scientist, considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional for the citizens.
According to him, it has not been for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time calls for extraordinary means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that this is what the Prime Minister wants to bring Finnishs to their sympathy for the tensions ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations organise demonstrations and strike against government action.
On Twitter, President of the Left, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipila could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed as well.
Ms Rinne (St.), president of the SDP, also announces that he has an interview with the Sipila dialogue.
We don't have time for monologists.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time we found him.
THE son's father updated his Facebook site.
The Finnish Police Department will also confirm the case to the Bay of Eastern Finland.
The kid went out four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was never contacted again.
My father thanked everyone who's been looking for help.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent devastation of young people: You can hate it.
The Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which appeals particularly to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani had to speak against young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland at the age of five, has so far won both professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amitarkhani tells me he received a message asking to check out an Instagram account.
There have been video downloads of young people fighting with extreme violence.
My Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the youth's wild.
26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the ground, sit on the other one, and strike them with no eye on without thinking about any of the consequences of this, when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people in the videos are immigrants.
Jarmo Heinonen, Commissioner of the Helsinki Police, said that fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and by Finnish youths.
It's specifically that you're fighting the other side of the street.
You make it so much harder for many other immigrants to live here in Finland, the Turk Amikhani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds me that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite gross.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be quite a long time guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, Amikhani says.
Amirkhani invites young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the object of some racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go into this kind of thing, guys.
My Amirkhani says that violent activity is giving rise to racism.
You guys make me hate what I don't like.
You're in a pretty bad mood anyway, and that's not going to cure them, Amikhani will decide.
SAK will put its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, President Lauri Lyly, SAK's president, says that the employees' organisation will consider its position on Monday on an alternative list of savings.
Lauri Lyly commented on STKK's proposal on Twitter.
In the past, STKK informed the Government of its proposal to reach the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) on Wednesday.
The programme president, Mr Fjäder, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STK and Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest payer organisation, the SAK, should reduce its previous position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, president of the SAK, commented on the issue in a dire way on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open up the labour market lock, and the status of forced labour laws requires agreements by active parties.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipila's Government's proposal for a social agreement did not qualify the SAK.
In the past, the Sipilä cut off the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAA refused to commit itself to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: A big demonstration is threatening to go west - I feel like it's a bit funny to pick up a fist.
You know, I feel like it's a little funny to put on a fist, if there's an apocalypse in your pocket, write on Peggy Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in the employee camp.
Is it supposed to call the government abrogation, or should it agree?
On Monday, the Federal Directors of the SAK broke out sacred hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut up.
The threat spread to the intended ones, too.
OAJ threatened to close schools and day-care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) chairman of STKK, the Staff Centres' Organisation, appeared amicably.
He reported that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing the alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) for a 5% productivity break.
The president of the plan, Mr Fjäder (kok), rushed to announce that his contract paper was ready.
At first, the SAK's office didn't belong to a yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (Sd) is difficult to reach out to when the allies just on Monday ordered the earth to stand on Friday.
Finally, Lyly announced that the SAC Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAC would seek solutions to open up the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept the 5% productivity margin as a target.
No wonder the STKK of Palola has a good relationship with the government of Sipilä.
The right hand of Palola, Head of the STKK Social Impactor Jukka vinus, previously acting as Special Representative of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire also described that the government's ay-skills have been improved all the time.
Incident or not, but Palola's output was slightly off from Finnish hosts, whose photo of the wedding was Marko Rajainen (sd).
You know, I feel like it's a little funny to put on a fist if there's an matching paper in his pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: \"This must not happen again,\"
President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, feels that Mongolia is better than the OSCE father in Finland.
In Mongolia's capital Ulan Bator, a guilt meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Festival.
In that case, Finland did not allow the entry of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced by the European Union to attend a meeting - a matter which the President repeatedly reminded journalists of.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This can't happen again. Naryshkin stressed the news agency according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only by Finland and the EU but also by the United States, where his access had been blocked.
Sants are a political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
The Russian delegation in Mongolia was complex, so Naryshkin continued to blink in Finland with praise and thanks for the special organisation of Mongolia.
I am sure that Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with positive results, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
Mongolia's leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue does not involve obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanervan (kok) leading the Ulan Bator meeting, which, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian délegation.
The lock meets the true playoff mirror:
The killer and the Luk continue today at Hakamets bull days while both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicted that today at Hakametsa we will not see a real goal party.
The killer went to Kuopio yesterday to take out a 3-and-time win from KalPa.
The rise was masculine, because last season the silver team was at its worst from the defeat position of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was more than a bull's-eye.
The Iron Island as a guest of the Blues that started as a guarantee was a round zero point, and the defeat readings were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Lukku shocker Janne Lahti anticipates settings on the club's pages.
The killer has formed quite a playoff nightmare for the raumas.
In fact, during the last two periods, Tappara has just dropped the final series of Lukko in the middle.
On both floors, the solution has been called for by a decisive seventh mate.
In the last season, Lukuk took the series to a loss already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next breasts and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups, except for goal restraints.
The cashiers who fought both yesterday will be getting a peak today.
With the goal of killing, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhus, and between Lukuk and Lukuk, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: A terrible play going on in the music
Toivila, the Sports Director, wrote the main coach to Rautakallio a non-compatible extension, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a movie on Rocky where he was acting the main part.
The subservient censored the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Evoila wrote a soft ash story in Pori.
The nameless and wood-cuffed pastry went to all astonishment to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough, underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the iroquoises.
Hope became a blonde.
A fine TV browser, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The ace took a winning silver.
Hopela was one of the heroes.
Doctor Toivila believes that the novelty work of this period will work in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as an Aussie sports director has built a stand for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been dumping waste in the far end like Rocky pig meats at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than in a game with a gypsum.
Hopela has forgotten that, at Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Peggy Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi is crucified by the Sea Connery of Rautakallion.
Rautakallio is a leading performer of the most clumsy in Tovoila’s script, Rocky, as if Connery had been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing else in the Iron Hall than Rocky's favorite name.
The game philosophy of the Rautakallion is not part of running and running.
He appreciates a tough game, but there's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Aussie Garrett Stafford jacketed Tapparan to Jere Karjalainen's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judge, but Rautaallio put a man in a shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't accept that kind of game, and it's not part of the ace hat, the hot-headed Rautakallio woke up after the game to the people of Satakunta.
This season's team is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen, and assaulters.
There are virtually no key men at best.
It's no wonder the head coach's been complaining about a craftsman.
How much have you been able to influence players' acquisitions, Peggy Rautakallio?
The events of the last period have affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, and Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface.
The 1953 model of Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to a sports bomb in the city of Toivola.
The men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces over the three leagues of the season is equal to the loss of the goal difference of 1-6.
It would not have been worth writing a copy.
Olga Temone plays The Mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband, Tuuka, when she was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temone is in charge of her husband for the first time.
Yeah, I'm gonna show my husband's friend's mom in the movie.
In a way, it feels like a crazy, actor and producer Olga Temone laughs.
He's been married to Apulanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now Olga for the first time plays under Tuuka's guidance.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanta You made a beautiful movie of us is a rumbal Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka emppa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (who pretends to be Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true example in Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two of them have approached a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little color.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apula would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a depression, and it was really tough.
It was a little bit of a probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some inspiration, and she was right.
Olga tells me that he had heard a lot from Tuuka about this youth even before the film plans.
However, there have been some differences between the parents ’ stories.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Heinola's evil-minded Scribe, known as Tuuka.
Olga was a girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At most, he could have been a secret crush.
According to Olga, he has worked so hard with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a major joint project will not be afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production group will be going to Heinola for a month.
Although the couple living in Et often intend to drive home for the night because of their small children, the distance is not too long.
We will take over the whole month of Heinola.
They have received us with great warmness, only to ask which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to the most expensive play picture in Finland
The budget of the Iron Sky, led by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The shoots start in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins to describe the Iron Sky 2 film in October in Belgium.
The following section of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Comming Race, will be the most expensive play movie ever seen in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Jalmari Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation at work will rise once it has completed the Iron Sky 2, as the film has over €100 million budget.
The films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kakomaa begin in October near Antwerp in AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
There's no fear of a waste budget.
I've been just sick.
I've got such a loose figure on the script, because I know exactly what kind of movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell the newspaper.
Originally, 8 to 10 million had been planned for the film, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget's big, but it's a big stop.
However, 100 million people would get stuck in film because each image angle and performance are so expensive.
Now everything's bent so tight there's no find.
Iron Sky Universe, the film production company today launched a public finance campaign and a bond with a 4-8% annual rate.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and offer during the campaign.
In two years' time, the company will pay back the loan.

Junt or cool?
Big logos returning to shirts
The breasts of trends have recently been decorated by big logos.
Some time ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocsja in the Consana.
The promotion of a hooder or a T-shirt mark was seen as some kind of trainee.
But times change.
Sport has become the right fashion megatrend, and so have the old, familiar sports figures, such as Adidas and Nike, have risen to the cooling wave.
And, as ever, the limit of funny and trendy is perplexing: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm of the core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion where the trends were surprised by favoring as boring basic clothes as possible as a means of separating from the mass.
Now, instead of a gray base collegiate, you're going to point the dead end of the cabinet, and you're going to have the manufacturer's logo in front of you.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, for example, Adidas' identifiable track nets, the favorite team's game shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to the street fashion.
Farkki's edge is starting to mock the alps Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
Trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, Versace’s breast of the syphilis makes it clear what brand of clothing is all about.
Would you be willing to introduce logos in your dressing?
The Russian politician published the proof that I didn't hang into the tank's hatch!
It is claimed that a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia's Arms Expo was presented to Russian military industry products in 2015.
In recent days, Russia's media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove large sizes of Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
Even on his own public Facebook page, he published a picture of how he seems to squeal about the hatch of a tank vehicle in very good atmospheres and, at least, not because of their images, it's not about being stuck or angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start by not entering the combat tank, it was the hit-and-run car BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel. I've served in Ural.
I went in there, looked around me, and I came out alone, and Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army's television channel, Zotov, when he was interested in the exhibition, explained Russia's new technology because he was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons. I wanted our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next show, I'm definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the train wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also barked into the stupidity of a writer who wrote it.
One fool wrote it, and everyone else repeated it.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank didn't happen, he said Russkaja Sluzhba to novostei radio.
Zotov's words support the fact that no photographs of the alleged arrest have been published, although during a few days there were a total of 50,000 people in the arms show.
The claim about Zotov's intrusion began with a Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told about his pullout of the tank hatch when he tried and finally threatened to shoot all those around him unless he got out of his surface.
Later, Bloknot’s website published a further story in which the exhibitors reported their views on what had happened.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his big size, simply delayed when he came out.
But he certainly didn't sit for five hours, said to Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot, the director of the exhibition.

The winner shot Ville Korhone when the match was only a fair minute left.
16 September 1995 - East Sanomas
You're trying to find a way to stand up.
He's no paper, but you know he's not hard like a stone.
You are equal in many things, such as vitality.
You're wondering how things go.
You have strength and will to make it work.
It is also important to be gentle to yourself and others.
You're smart, but you're not fast enough to understand someone's view of it.
She's slow, and she doesn't even want to be guided by you.
You're on foot with someone, because one thing goes on.
There is not one way to approach it, but at least you know that you have a common goal.
You've taken a measure with someone.
However, you are not racing in the traditional sense, but you want to know what he really is his men or his women.
Your assumption is going to hit the right one.
That's why it's good to be ruffling his chest.
You have a chance today to deal with someone.
Do it, even if your time is on the card.
One is a self - quality person.
You'll understand it at the latest when he opens his mouth.
Elees and expressions also tell us a lot about it before.
Someone's sad about you.
You will not find anything amazing in this situation, but there is a lot of vague atmosphere in the air.
You know where you're headed.
Your experience is right, although someone wants to show you that he's much more aware of things than you are.
The need to highlight isn't the only thing in him.
Your capacity for various tasks has grown over the years.
Someone sees potential in you.
It's a matter of your self-esteem.
You're gonna stay and see if there's anything going on.
You're on the edge of things.

There's been a leak in the Kittilän mine by the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called extraction sandy wave into the stream.
According to the company, the measures to correct the leak have begun.
Alta has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water in the foaming process.
Usually, water is re-injected either as process water for use, or administered as authorised through the surface lighting field to the environment.
The rate of bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour.
According to the company, the quality of the bleeding water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the stuff came into the environment.
The bleeding was observed during the verification round on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the barrier structures of the pool has been observed.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
Finland's country report, published today by the IMF, is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pled into structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and for unemployment protection.
According to Pasi Kuoppamaamäe, the main economic operator of Danske Bank agrees with structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a great deal of sympathy for government action, but on the other hand there is a warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include investment in infrastructure, Kuopapamäki says to the House of Economics.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support poor economic growth.
The IMF expects a growth rate of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will reach 0.9% next year.
Danske is predicting today in his new economic forecast that growth will remain on the arrow this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was in the summer of low growth, Kuopämäki says.
Less attention could again be paid to industry's reduced confidence or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, only a few percent of decimals are involved in the differences.
The recovery Nintendo appointed a new leader
In July, Tantsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died from cancer, began her work on Wednesday, Nintendo reported on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii-consol.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assesses Ace Research analyst for Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to involve Nintendo strongly in mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread for traditional gaming consoles.
In Finland alone, more and more minor asylum seekers arrive
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that even hundreds of children who came to the country would disappear annually.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants are lost annually.
Oversight of the Finnish Immigration Service Juha Kannelmaa explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear under the country? - In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made on their own.
They disappeared nine years ago.
In 2014 similar applications were made in 196, and 11 of them disappeared.
It may be from the background of the disappearance that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to return to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, asylum seekers in Finland had a total of 3651 applications, of which 134 applications were closed because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past 123 years, he says.
Is the amount of money growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 requests for minor asylum on our own.
The total statistics on asylum seekers missing this year do not yet exist, but the number of minor applicants is known and is therefore clearly increasing, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have received the appeal?
For example, do they also disappear into the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the enforcement of the return decisions is carried out by the police, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered people.
He has taken action on this matter.
At the EU Home Minister's Conference on Refugees, Orpo reported on the practical measures taken on Monday to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
Timo T.A. Equipment used for television and radio production of Mikkonen by media contractor who lost their ability to work is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells Huuto.net equipment, which was at the time the most advanced professional equipment.
The first report on the online report was about the Iltamakasin web site.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, TV programs are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested ones will be found.
Of course, there is no more equipment in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from their current Myrskylä home.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've started to invent a little bit and see where they're giving up.
This is where I started. Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no longer any use for television or radio equipment.
It is clear from a recent stroke that a man who did a long career no longer returns to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, which was visited by representatives to collect films and other material from Myrsky.
Traffic is threatening to go into the worst since you think it is: Metro and trams can stop all Friday.
The drivers of the metro and the trams decide today whether to extend their efforts in connection with the demonstration of Friday's mind.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for the time of the Friday's demonstration of mind.
In the afternoon, it will decide whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Superintendent Peggy Hirvonen says there's a great threat on the field.
Night-and-day cuts are a bad thing for drivers, so the government plans to cut the tits raise opposition.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that standing up throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and the trams stand by Friday, public transport in the capital is practically completely stopped.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between 6 a.m. and nighttime on Friday.
On Friday, there will be no close-up or long-distance traffic.
The trains that left before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to fixed stations.
According to HSL data, the majority of buses remain in shadow.
The ACP members are out of work Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by superior forces, the HSL informant Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus routes are going on Friday.
Employees organisations organise large-scale demonstrations at the Rautatientor in Helsinki on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used cynical gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tears gas.
The incident occurred at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against humans.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas, and the teacher thought he was a bomber.
In the United States of Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher considered his own time in school as a bomb bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to introduce his electronics output.
However, one of the teachers thought that the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were invited to the scene, and the situation ended with the boy being taken to the juvenile detention cell in the cuffs.
Mohamed has not been found at any time to claim that he had made a watch.
Still, it's still possible the boy was accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the cops said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The watch is held in police custody, but it was known to be made up of a circuit board and a digital screen between which were wires.
Last Monday, the incident happened and Mohamedia was punished for three days by being forced to leave school.
His father is furious about the case, and the American Council in the country wonders whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
The president of Labour refused to sing a national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the Monarch.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has hurt the people, thought Kate Green was a lab citizen in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s memorial event respected the battle of British Air Force pilots against Germany’s Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corby) stood silently during the national song, highlighted in the opinion.
Corbyn's choice as party leader has divided the lines of the labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral armaments, stop saving and increase in public expenditure.
Today, for the first time, Corbyn is to be present in Parliament in the capacity of the party leader during Question Time by the Prime Minister.
Corby has asked the general public for proposals on what should be asked by Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron crawled on Twitter on the weekend, choosing Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister referred to in his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father was waiting for the trial.
South Lake Mintonka Police have been investigating for a week family death in Minnesota Greenwood.
The family of five were found dead in their home on September 10th and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
First, after shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the house garage.
Dead days already.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this report, the police went to the house for inspection visits and found a huge house all over Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and Successful Enterprise
South Lake Mintonka's police chief Michael Sitair's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses at AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in the StarTribune interview Short reported there are four million different visitors per week.
I have received 50 bids from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a business, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the purchase by Short's family from Greenwood in 2011 of a silly house of $2 million.
The house is advertised on the property website in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars with sufficient garages.
Case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the family father was waiting for a court case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering a variety of precision courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments had been removed from Short's site that were delicious, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered me some cake coffees.
In addition, the owner-in-law was awarded the Hungarian Hippus's month horse owner prize.
This is great, Lois commented on her very good windy plan of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on September 1st and earned 100 000 euros.
The art legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the big race.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse coach corporal receives the full work peace while working with the horse.
He's got to figure out what to take the horse to compete with.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Lois.
It's a great gesture from the NBL star - the greatest athlete ever made.
The superstar P. K. Subban, Montreal Canadiens, has donated $10 million (approximately 6.7 million) to Montreal children's hospital.
According to the hospital report, this is the single donation made by all time's greatest athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in another financial collection for the next seven years.
Subban and the Canadiens made a deal worth eight years and 72 million dollars a year ago.
So the Subban contribution amount is significantly higher than his $9 million years.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will be given his name in the hospital.
The Canadiens players have been a major help to the local hospitals before.
A year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a sum of money for another large hospital that gave the hospital the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
A Japanese coffee shop can order a wife for dinner - serving just bikinis and snacks on her head
The theme cafes are a tough thing to do in Japan.
The market already has a goat coffee shop, a chicken coffee, a vampire coffee shop, a hug coffee shop and now a wife coffee shop.
It hits lonely, socialized, hungry.
It's the Metro news.
In Tokyo, Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee can be ordered for the evening of a wife or husband.
It's a waiter pretending to be a client's spouse.
\"Police is selected from the list before the coffee shop comes and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is facing just the roses and the bikinis on her head, and the husband is back on tight bikes.
The website offers candidates for wives all information about length and weight to the kind of pillow they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks on the security of cars began to be equipped with
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the sector, reports Intel's release.
The Board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
The ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research findings.
Gartner estimates that about 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles can consume, create and share online data.
We can, and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Mr. Intel Security Director Chris Young.
The ASRB allows Intel to establish best practices on safety and to support the view that cyber safety is an important component of the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.

Chisu went back to the stage... rapping in a brave haalarist.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's an open neck hole in the electric pants.
The outfit presents a beautiful song star's lair belt.
The total is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, a singer who became a mother has been given weights of weight to be cut off with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to fill up a year.
The singer published his first single album in August.
Back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've been sorry to do anything about music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish her new album in a couple of weeks, while her fourth album is called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's motherly style will be an agitated again - now we're seeing breasts.
A true-a-a-a-a-a-a beautiful Kim Kardashian gives speeches to one another.
He presents his pregnancy coat and breasts freely in sexy clothes, last night at one American time, when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left the fish of the husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the chests.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the light of the lightning lights.
The last time Kardashian dressed up for the atrocious maternity stage when he visited his friend at dinner parties in New York just a couple of days ago.
The department stressed the black over-polven boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the performance schedule was pregnant.
Hard laws in the world: No homes, you are lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model of Manon Leloup wanted to take a shortcut to the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary Spearing Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about clean model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins with nothing.
Even if during the previous period you would have been in the costumes of top designers, the new season will begin again in Castinnge.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces to compete with the coconies.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuing to travel and can go for a year so that there is a hotel room or an apartment in which the fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother is unable to travel with you, loneliness can be irresistibly difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they're the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
Agent New York may ask for a drop in pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Designs and designers work together all the time and work as a support network.
When they run out of fashions, it's a little weird.
Models want this sector because of the possibilities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks the job is just a presentation of clothes.
The models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes you feel like they're actors with some kind of role.
But you can also express yourself at the work of the model.
You were modeling for Tory Burch last night.
New York is currently having fashion weeks where designers will reveal their model next year.
Roope Salmine, who has moved into style, plays the most famous Apulanta music in the film
The Roope Salminen performs the band’s founding member Antti Lautala in an early-year film based on the Apulant Society.
Apulanna was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but it was different from the group in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie, I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before the descriptions because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I'm only learning her playing style from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a person.
A man with a complete trust in the Roope Salminen and the Dogs doesn't play a role.
The punk-mans are coming with him by nature.
The stars, in the punk season of the star show, surely many saw the first taste, as well as if you've ever been to our gigs.
We've never had anything small, but we're always going full.
In the basso of 1993-2004, you were directed by Tuukka Temosen, the main actors of the film were released today.
The nuclear force known to the audience of the band is presented by young actors who are not yet known to the general public.
Rumbali Sipe Santapukki is represented by Tepo Manner, singer of Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosto Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen tipped off his future nest last night, when he mysteriously told him that he was preparing for the most important day of his career in Snapchat.
Roope has already released a picture of his new collection yesterday in Instagram, which he has been forced to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in mustaches and leukaparra, has shaved his face into siloposch and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychology advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think over recent days about how to tell children about the situation of refugees who are trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
You don't have to talk about it, SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting younger children, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children do not always understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and trouble, he says.
However, if the child has encountered or heard refugees from the television news scene, it is worth speaking about.
It is good to have a discussion from the point of view of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child’s fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that the parents think he's afraid of.
You don't have to be afraid of being scared, even if you're upset and scared.
A younger child is closely followed by the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Larger children are likely to have a discussion about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It's good for parents to have a conversation with them if it's a matter of thinking about a child.
The fact is, not everyone in the world is okay.
Parents, together with their children, can ask themselves, ‘ How does our family view this? ’
In the end, though, do we think that the world is safe or safe?
Parents may also have different educational angles - some may want to protect their children if possible from anxiety.
On the other hand, if the family also speaks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life ahead.
This could be good for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: - Teach your child to help you weaker -
Your own strengths at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Hard to control the bloodline impacting Pallosalamaa
Perttu Pohjola got rubbed up by Apila Pallosalama in the middle of the fall.
It only ravaged winnings and second-liners until, at the end of July, a collapse occurred in the ruins of Tampere.
Since the Ori was thoroughly clogged, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from his veterinarian.
The explanation for passing out was clear.
The horse had a sore throat.
The disease was not from the most mildest head, but it required two medical courses to recover it.
Since Apila Pallosalama had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says she was welcome to the surprise of the horse’s last run.
It was in Turku at its record time after the second SE-mama Taruntuule.
Apila's Pallosalama was on a break when it could have been driven normally for just a few weeks.
Those things, considering a small tendency at the end, were understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a fair race made the Ori a steel.
The horse certainly went ahead of it, and I hope it would have been even.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
When you're not interested in it, it could've thrown you into a lot of fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been removed by such lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
In a nut speed, competitions can't handle Pallosalama, where even warm-blooded rides can't get off.
There's a mirror running in Vermo in the wishes of the North.
However, there is a difference between how Apila Pallosalama agrees.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and it might even fall under the boom of the departure car and something like that.
I hope the Ori are more calm than Turku's leaving.
Apila's Pallosalama can come out of the ring when she's fine, and we're going to take her out of victory, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of your iPhone software.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least a part of the programmes that will come with Apple's iPhone phones may be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from your iPhone, reports the company's CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed during an interview.
There are a number of programs on Apple's iPhone that are relatively rarely used: FaceTime calls, Lehti Kioski, Health, Stock Exchanges, Podcast and Vinkis come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became an obsessive update for iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So Cook says Apple's looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, and Eurostat reported today by the EU Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices led down to lower energy prices.
In this way, Eurostat revised the 0.2% margin for a few weeks.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called basic inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the whole 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
The largest increase in consumer prices in the euro area was 1.4 per cent in August, Malta.
In Cyprus inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent below the EU's harmonised index.
The inflation rate in the euro area remains firmly away from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two per cent marked increase in prices over the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
In the next year, the rate will rise to 1.1 per cent; the central bank expects it to publish its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
U.S. Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The United States' next recession will begin at its fastest below one year, but it will certainly be within three years after the national central bank Fed begins again for a long time to raise its interest rates.
And the fall in the financial markets will begin before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that the interest rates might start already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed at its fastest by next autumn and as a course for financial markets before that.
Or at least this is the case if the world's largest economy and financial markets work like they've done, and if they react to Fed's money flow as they've done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank in its extensive long-term investigation of market and economic cycles of the London market study by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The bank distributed over 60 pages Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe they know when exactly Fed will begin to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they present economic statistics with cool facts and calculations of how the economy and the market have previously behaved at the time and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at the key economic and financial market variables that are now in the same or the second model as at the time of previous interest rates.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a shady state for an increase in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
Not even a year at the beginning of the recovery.
Fed's monetary policy and its respective vigors have been suggesting that the time has started to rise interest rates.
The first interest rate over nine years can already come this week.
The matter will be settled in the middle of the week and on Thursday, when the board of the Fed board of the open market committee is meeting to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed fundamentals rate in June 2006.
At the end of the same period of two years, the series of smaller interest rates of 0.25 per cent that Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25 per cent to 5.25%.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing funding in the United States, and the financial crisis later became a global nightmare of the day of judgment.
The major recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economic imbalances began to slow down than has typically happened since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have been screening the rises and declines of the world's largest economies and financial market movements since 1950 and places from the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed's interest rates and their financial and financial impact have been clear since the 1950s.
From the start of the recovery, the earliest interest rate is less than a year, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase on the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed has in turn raised and turned down its steering rate since the beginning of the 1950s by a dozen distinct cycles.
Each time there has been some differences between others, and the number of times is relatively limited in the review, so it is unlikely to conclude anything certain about the impact of the following interest rates.
In fact, the strategies remind me that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The cause of the financial crisis may not, even through decades of research, be undisputed for the guilty.
But three things about the leaders of the crisis and the reasons that have increased its destructive power must be somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the euro area ECB and the other world’s largest central banks considered their governance rates too low in the 21st century.
They were in position for technocupla's tracks, and they raised the next one at the same time.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated and already too high in various parts of the financial and real economy increased even more than the impact of monetary policy on central banks.
It was born the biggest debt ratio of economic history in the past.
3) In particular, the craziest debt financing packaged into the financial economy, which was the most important feature of financial market history in the past, was the largest exchange rate of shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Even so, it is difficult to question the fact that, in the event of an ever more complex debt gap, the financial markets that rose to heights were in a rare, dangerous and unstable state when Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
After the interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up, the valuation curves were not as long as the debt ratios had been up.
Risks were realised as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not consider what is going to happen, but give rise to a cause of nuclear activity by mentioning, for example, the following points:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been mad as ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt stock of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, the debt burden has been heavyer than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has flown from the lower and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has slowed down the main types of securities and assets to the top or ever since the financial crisis.
Neither are the strategies of the Latin atmosphere only with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the worst recession to the model of what has happened before.
The euro area's economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in unusually weak condition, but the pressure and risks of the financial markets are significantly higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next comes to tightening up his cash flow.
Perhaps the picture of Albert Edwards' future of the Socie Generale strategy is not as strange as it may suddenly be.
He has been training the bank's international investor clients for the following full translations:
First, Fed's raising interest rates, then the financial gaps break out, and soon Fedin's time to shut down the financial shocks with even bigger QE money injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) preparing computers and printers intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at the HP company service side, the company reports.
In November, HP is divided into HP Inc., a company that focuses on commercial sales, on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and on consumer pc machines and printers.
In 2011, HP had 350000 employees.
Last October, the staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for a one-off cost of the arrangements of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30,000 workers.
The consumer’s reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries, with 60% of its employees in countries with low costs in 2018.
The company tells us that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In that year, 65 per cent of the operating profit was generated by its three major customers.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system after the update of your iPhone Apple
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, clicking on the \"General\" and then selecting \"Soft update\".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow you to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation, when the screen has been released, the read-only update failed.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to get the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool to propose removal applications and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is charged or the charger close to the upgrade, that the battery will not end in the middle.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not let the update proceed, because if the battery stops in the middle, it may lead to an update failure.

IOS 9 brings with you new features, such as a much more intelligent personal assistant and hugely new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and repair the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has acted under the government of the tax haven.
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (centre) has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paraparatist Company.
According to Ylen, the company was involved in the so-called tax planning.
This is about the Luxemburg-based Saltri II LuxCo, which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still an official member of the Board.
Berner himself says that he has left the resignation declaration in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to leave the notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, says Berner in Yle's interview.
Membership after fusion
The municipality of the Swedish Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg Company.
Kährs is a floor maker, fused with Finnish flooring manufacturer Karelia-Upflor in 2012.
Berner worked with the Government of Karelia-Upflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger at Kährs and in Luxembourg.
According to Ylen, Kährs' ownership passes through a multi-ported ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted government membership in the Luxemburg company Kährs at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been with the government of the Karelian Upflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was picked up with a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my role was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish corporate capitals is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was safeguarded here, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of tax havens is due to the fact that Triton had the largest owner of Kährs' capital fund already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre operated by the company
Espoo Otaniemi will open the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from the evening onwards.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the former Rescue University real estate.
Luona Oy operates in the field of health care and medical care.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTIS prepares an alternative labour market tightening package
The STKC will start preparing an alternative package of government working tensions.
The organisation also hopes that other organisations of the employee’s centre will be included.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently being paid to Friday’s demonstration of mind.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola noted at the organization’s administrative meeting for journalists.
On the other hand, it is estimated that the Central Economic Union (EC) does not have the capacity to hold discussions.
The STTK Economists have calculated that the change in the government competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a terrible enthusiasm on the part of this party to have a conversation if there's one side of the relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as then the government is to submit a communication on its own package to the Parliament and to start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the discussion with the government exists, and it has been constructive about him all along.
In particular, Sunday surgery is a painful place according to Palola.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation in which it will implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STK, Palola does not allow the alternative package to be prepared with SDP.
The employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the working blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the first day of sickness pay is cut, overtime benefits are half paid, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STKK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to protest, and that there has been no organisation of strike.
Thank you to the plan, Mr Fjäder
The President of the Plan, Mr Sture Fjäder, congratulates the STKK on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STKK is now on the same lines as the Plan, since the Plan has already outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without Sjäder the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The plan president, Mr Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will be prepared as an option for surgery.
In the past, Ms Palolan STKK said that he would prepare new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it had long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate with the government of the country's aim of achieving a 5 % competitive advantage as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government submissions.
We are ready to see the terms of the service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the plan lines, as the STKK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The proposed Bureau shall meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. with a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
The same boat, the joint coal, the thugs... play bingo when Sipilä talks tonight.
Green Left of Tampere University
The Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
In the past, Prime Ministers have spoken exceptionally during Mäntsälä's rebellion and war.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Ylen Channel on Wednesday night at 21.05.
The corresponding Prime Minister’s previous speech must go until 1932, when the Prime Minister was the prime minister of the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and Ministers held several radio calls during the winter and the follow-up war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koiviston, but it was more of a ceremony.
In autumn 1976, President Urho Kekkonen quit with a television call from the train performers' strike.
Lone phone, monoarchistic makeup.
The Sipilä's speech has raised all day's criticism and guesses about what I'm about to do.
On Twitter, President of the Left, Paavo Arhinmäki said that \"Silpä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration from the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be debated as well.\"
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, we've already seen a private call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the Ekki Judges of the SDP condemned that the “monarchist makeup: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it”
Ms Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged the Sipila dialogue: \"A half a year after the elections.
Not a single act from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's office, Sipila's speech is recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the SAK President Lauri Lyly and the EC CEO Jyri Häkämämaja, will comment on this in direct communication.
Ylea has been criticised for presenting Sipilä's speech.
We thought about this and said that it was a public service mission to promote public access throughout Finland, the Ylen publication leader in the news of Ismo Silva Yle.
It's like the time of the Tammels.
The speech has also raised loose conduct.
The dinner we've had tonight will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be put on their stockings and put on their best.
My mom puts on a nicest hole, and my dad's making a tie in her neck.
At 9 a.m., it's gonna be quiet on TV like before the time of the Tammells, writing a bloggari Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell us why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens of millions of people hiding capitalists who are making a mercy laws for their fellow tax fighters and, at the same time, claiming to the people that we have to cut it when the government is out of money, asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere Green Left Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by the next bingo.
Tonight, do we hear of the same boat, of common coal, of living in debt and of team spirit?
Coupons and pens completed, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: the Western countries rejected Russia's proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abandon power, tells President Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian United Nations Ambassador proposed a plan that would, after a while, give al-Assad the power a little bit of style.
However, Western countries did not respond to the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk, in a bilateral debate, listed three points of plan: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out in a controlled manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, Ahtisaari will remind me of Guardian's interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he had delivered a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the paper, but Ahtisaari says that there are no two words for it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that at that time the Al-Assad troops had already committed a number of mass killings and the key opposition groups refused all the agreements with which they would have stayed in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Middle East, expressed doubts about the speech of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was not ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad at any time.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
At some point, Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have answered that I wanted to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's rock to keep power with some al-Assad supporter.
The escape current of our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own deeds.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we pay for the bill we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Centre for the Management of Asylum Seekers at Storm Tower
The Management Centre for asylum seekers, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in the Tower.
The centre would be set up in the building of the empty Tornio joint-lyse building in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a status solution to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hööppinen (left), Vice-President of the City Council of Tower, that is not the case.
When the whole council was not assembled and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite a council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday to specify to the STT.
At the local discussion, 36 of 43 had been authorised.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 authorised persons.
Based on that, you could expect the decision to be positive, Héppelinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and it was quickly responded.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too,\" Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to tightening up from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) half of the holiday money in the public sector would only account for part of the government’s efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government is pleased to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree to it.
In Parliament, Sipilä told journalists that he had not been involved with the social partners.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were looking for compensation for the government's announcement of working tensions.
If such an agreement is created, we will be happy to accept it as part of the whole package.
In Sipilä’s view, half of the holiday money would be a means of working because it would be directed at almost all employees, unlike, for example, the Sunday surgery envisaged by the government.
The social partners could agree on cutting off holiday money because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present this vision to the Parliament next week on the Wednesday of the crisis in the form of a Government communication on working life.
According to Sipilä, the proposals made by the organisations should be known before.
This isn't the end limit either.
The legislative work will then start to run, i.e. the train will move and it will become more difficult all the time.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long for things like this if there's will, Sipillä.
The list published last week by the Government includes, among other things, the conversion of the end-end and helatorsta into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the first days of sickness are cut, overtime paid, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of the work carried out by the employee centre, the employees’ organisations organise a large-scale demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political laws.
Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the juice hall warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi approved unanimously but slightly the expansion of the cornered Norwegian Koivu Oy’s hall, i.e. the storage of juice hall.
The assessment was based on the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than it was originally mentioned.
Also, a busy schedule badly.
It was also a little surprised that the need for order was not known a year ago when the decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400 to 450 square metres was approved in the investment programme, but the most recent partial annual report is to be concluded.
On the agenda there was still mention of EUR 150 000-200 000 investment, but at the meeting Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it would bring work and tax revenues to the local government.
There is no risk for the municipality as the company pays the investment in rent, Vesa Väkiset (ps.) justified.
Another place for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government reduced its previous sharp position to bring street signs in cattleland to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and, in the right sense, the preservation of the livestock tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the cattle language, because there are no historical grounds for it, nor is the language of the herd an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in Joensuu’s region has been more part of the eastern acidic fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no street signs of cattle in the city centre.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the language of the cattle plant, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Even though Joensuu is officially a single-lingual municipality, it is also worth taking a thorough approach to the language of the herd now that multilingualism is living and is undergoing a major change in northern Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well used to benefit from a wide range of regional marketing.
Disposals of train connections are cutting off the vitality of the country
Circumcisions of train connections hit the country's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the business and competitiveness of the county.
And it affects whether or not we can live and work here at all, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points out air transport, which has also been on several occasions in the report.
For the whole country, it is important that we do not succeed in reducing our chances by government measures, as is now the case.
We should look at the impact of these decommissions on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport connections is an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course the better services here, such as transport connections and housing, are easier to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, head of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Marko Junkariinen, Chief of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the connections are weak in the opposite direction.
About half of students from the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, around 10-20 per cent is from the New Land, partly explained by direct rail connections.
Joensuu became one of my sororities for Siu's war
The view of the City Government in Joensuu on the regional Siu war project is apparently unanimous, but there is one sorority among them.
The City Government member Pentti Kessalo (see picture) presented the Government at its Monday meeting for the entire project to be abandoned, but his performance fell unprofitable.
The Government approved the decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give the final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Traffic in passenger trains from Kouvola to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one train path will be less frequent.
There will be changes to passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train couple stays out, but still five times a day from Kouvola goes from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reduction is due to state savings.
For the next four-year period, the purchase of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped off.
The rescue facility released a 12-year-old from the game to the roof, who couldn't get off the roof with my own help.
The situation was brought about at Tornion Hill on Ketotie at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no ladders on the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb along the mass of radio amateurs next to it on the roof of the house.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the other men were moving from the scene and the passersby were alerting the rescue facility to help them safely return to the surface of the last roof.
FedEx’s operating profit is dubious, decreases the outlook for 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in the last quarter, and the delivery waste cut the whole year's profit forecast, due to the reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it was going to hire some 55,000 season workers during the holidays.
This time last year FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 season workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening watch of the Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says that it is expected to be the final tax year next May for $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cent lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts waited for $10.84 to tell us about the FactSet survey.
Despite the average price increases of 4,9 %, which entered into force on January 4th, the smaller outlook came in spite of higher charges on land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said that it expects the operating profit to grow from the previous year, because they cut costs, turnover has increased and online sales are growing.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company will continue to be stable, taking into account the more expected economic conditions, particularly in production and global trade.
The plans for pay during vacation were published on the day after the competitor UPS announced that he was going to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the fourth quarter of August 31, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The winning per share came to $2.42, which is left with an average estimate of $2.44.12 analysis polls carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
At Zack's survey, six analysts expected $1.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a reduction in international priority transport in recent years, which has stopped the development of its Express unit's turnover.
However, the rise in the online trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land units increased by 29 per cent, but in principle, the revenues of operations were the same because of the cost of larger packages and the cost of their own insurance.
The costs of the Express unit were higher because of the higher basic payments, while the operating profit in cargo decreased higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, around an hour before the opening watch, FedEx’s shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $15.15.
FedEx closed on Tuesday 11 per cent in the fall to this year and 17 per cent below the June 11th record.
The decision-makers of the US Central Bank will sit around the huge mahogany table for two days this week in a long-awaited meeting deciding whether the time has come to raise the rate of control for the first time in almost a decade.
The two-storey meeting room of the central bank is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and his colleagues, must put the financial interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
Congress has placed two responsibilities on the shoulders of the central bank: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
Since the great recession, however, the central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a crucial factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, and the decision whether the US economy is prepared to be evaporated with a record of the incentive that has been brought by the US to a short-term interest rate of almost zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data show that the economy is growing steadily, recent shock in the global financial markets may have already made its reserveed central bank officials more upset than ever with regard to increasing instability, it is feared how it would affect if the federal fund rate had even increased by one percentage point in a quarter.
\"I understand that labour markets and inflation are the first and most important aspects to be monitored,\" says Lindsey M. Piegza, the brokering expert at Stifel Nicolalaus & Co.
\"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for a return to interest rates, there will be enough uncertainty on the world market to justify it,\" he says.
The decision of the central bank has not been reached in agreement, which already leads to a nervous economy.
According to Bloomberg's recent study, around half of economic experts predict that interest rates are rising this week.
On the other hand, the financial market expects the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows that there is only about 30 % potential for growth.
This suggests a fall in the securities market if the central bank does not raise the level, unless the decision-makers would then be able to soften the attack by promising that the next increase will not take place shortly.
Tuesday, Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228,89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16599,85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group’s main economic expert.
I'm surprised if the central bank is raising interest right now, he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, they must see a lot of effort in their guidelines to support the financial markets so that they do not panic.
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial market because it would eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago, it seemed that this month the central bank would be raising its interest rate by a quarter percentage point, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would verify the stability of the US recovery.
Yelle has said in spring and early summer that she expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of piracy.
Although inflation remains below the ECB’s 2% annual target, the central bank’s decision-makers believe that access to this is significantly reduced by a temporary impact on the price of oil.
The economy is even more aware of the interest rates and also needs them in view of the strict labour market situation, says Ian Shepherdson, the chief economic expert of the Pantheon Macroeconics company.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocking last week when China depreciated its currency.
Dow Jones' industrial average index decreased by up to 16 per cent of their Maytime record, when investors were afraid that China's slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The markets have recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the top level of the May.
For the central bank's decision-makers, market transparency is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells us that interest rates should be increased.
“I do not have these financial market events and the news of recent weeks on the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting, ” says Stephen D. Oliner, a special researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, as well as a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers wait at least a month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
“The possible effects on the US economy are still very unclear, and they have little information at their disposal as regards the consequences of China’s events, ” says Oliner.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernänke, the then president, suggested that the central bank could – intensify – increase the amount of money, caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly concentrated, central bank officials are expected not only to develop elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science, says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) in Richmond, Virginia, stated this month that the central bank had previously overreacted its financial market operations, which had been influenced by a separate economic factor.
The Federal Open Market Committee for decisions has called for an increase in interest rates, and the Committee's voter, Mr Lacker, appeals to decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings, despite its limited identifiable effects on US economic growth, Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank cancelled these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during the great crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Committee on Interest.
The most recent myllery does not come near its level, Posen says.
\"No one wants to see a situation where an increase in interest rates is feared because the market is getting worse,\" says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Law on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) continues to contain a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Rio Grande, Brazil’s Child Disease Organization advertises healthy diet for infants
The Brazilian Child Health Organization SPRS has developed a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good food during the nursing period by publishing photos of babies sucking breasts with painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast-feeding is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that adding calorie is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
The recent study conducted by Professor Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, Robert Waterland, revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic appearance of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favorite viewer in terms of terms, despite the Nine Channel attempts to keep the leader’s release on the Today Show programme.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's attack on Canberra's news of the leadership of the Liberal Party failed to increase Today's audiences.
The morning program of the Nine Channel was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull was forced from power to Tony Abbott.
The competing program of Sunrise, which is run by David Koch and Samantha Armyage, was stuck in London as part of the week's sustainable series of international broadcasts that also cover Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The pressure of the distance did not seem to be detrimental to Australian TV viewers, as the average value of Sunrise’s viewers was 397 000 in the five state capitals, while Today’s figure was 339 000.
Today averaged slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) figures, but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
For the time being, Sunrise's average is 349 000 viewers, while Today's figure is 314 000.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
Change in the wind this morning is blowing away from Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 word series, where the former Packed to the Rafters series was featured by Erik Thomson, the amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered a pretty impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
The critics have wondered if Thomson was the ultimate force of the popular series alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave it real certainty.
The X Factor Seven Channel program was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block series (838,000) and the TBL Familyes (726 000).
The Seven Channel had a dual fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new visualization programme run by Andrew O'Keefe gathered 446 000 viewers in the middle of the year.
Another half hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was a small enough victory for Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer value was 520 000 viewers, and the second half-hour figure was a peak of 720 000.
Hot set average was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night viewer mean that the Nine channel is confident that the Hot Sea will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on the McGuir program.

The final triangle agrees with Daddy that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavos-Flows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could have accidentally revealed who wins the Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret with which Sam Wood will end up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are definitely not gonna slip out who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeavons-Fellows day before the three became two, they could have deliberately given a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women threw themselves into the poetry of telling them how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity and positiveness as a reason why they would like to be his partner.
But when asked of them, \"If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom it should go, their answer might have offered a demonstration of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Flows and Markoski quickly referred to Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since the first day.
Since I walked into the house, (Sarah) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind all the time, and Jeavons-Flows said.
\"Sarah's really close to the ground, it's funny being with him,\" Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be the right one.
When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that obviously this isn't just a game - I'm here with my whole heart, he said.
When you ask who Wood should choose if he wasn't her, Mackay was highly respected.
I don't know if I can say, he said.
I like the remaining girls as much as I do, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his change to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne on the switch bench for the end game after this Australian rugby league turned down when the first flight kick returned to the team when winning Minnesota on Tuesday from 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Haynen return the next plane kick and took him along after the injury of Reggie Bush.
The real character of Tomsula was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of barking his newcomer for a pattaluh in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
The 49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the plane kick that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of a game.
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans were hoping for a man's NFL-debyyt.
Haynen was seen on his way out from the field after the fall, and later he told the Australian radio lighter Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
Now it's just one of these things, all you have to do is think about the next game, and that's it, Hayne said.
And Hayne compared his acidification with his 2007 original debut, when the feed in his own target area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted his Instagram account in a photo published with fans, holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun under attack on the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted of the seizure of his oil company Yukos and his efforts to support democracy being restricted.
4 In the shooting of a police officer, Kumiliots against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old son, died in the southern Nepal police - shot rubber bags in a mob that expressed their opinion against the new constitutional proposal of the country, the Authority reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandus.
Chief official of the region Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 protestors had been gathered outside the police station and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot the air before resorting to rubber bags.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber particles known to have been killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative seemed to have caused so many deaths.
In the last few weeks of violent demonstrations, there were some of Nepal's Southern protests, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the new Constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own state.
After 10 days of August, at least 40 people have died in violent conflicts, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement with which the country was divided into provinces - this is a big step towards the new Constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned until 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the draft Constitution clauses for Katmandusa, and the authorities have said that the new Charter has been adopted by Sunday.

Google will launch a donation campaign with the aim of collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees in Europe escape war and poverty.
Google had an exceptionally personal viewpoint in its published donation campaign blog.
Instead of making a statement with the Director, Google’s employee Rita Masoud, who fled with his family from Kabul when he was seven years old, wrote about his personal experience.
“Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, and hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness, ” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But once the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it would account for the same amount for every injection made worldwide on Google.com/refugereleef, up to $5.5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
Since then, the worst refugee crisis in Europe is the cause of World War II, and the main cause of this is the civil war in Syria, which has led more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many will also flee war on Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Excessive surgery can help mildly overmustable diabetics
According to the new study, the benefits of mildly obese type 2 diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after the weight loss than those treated in other ways than surgery.
\"A long time to get mortality data,\" says Dr. Robin Blackstone. \"He's a weight loss expert who wrote the script in a new publication on the JAMA Surgery.
Different methods for reducing the size of the stomach canal are used in diluent or bariatric surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects involved in the study have been sickly fat, and their BMI has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to length, is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is more than 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan, using data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and the reduction of the stomach, type 2 diabetes treatment in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI for cut persons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, persons who were treated with other means than surgery remained BMI in the same way as in 29.
Of the persons cut, 36% of the patients improved completely and 28% partially.
Due to comparison, in the treatment-treated group, diabetes was fully improved by only 1% and in part by about 2%.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and, in general, the LDL-cholestor were better in the operating group, the writers noted.
Patients also monitored haemoglobin levels of A1c in the blood that reflect long-term blood glucose levels.
The haemoglobin level of A1c should be maintained at less than 7%, with researchers writing.
After surgery, the haemoglobin level of A1c fell from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable in approximately 8%.
This improved-glycaemia control, as described by improved haemoglobin levels of A1c, did not reduce mortality over five years, reports Dr. Chih-Ceng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the group in the stomach reduction surgery, the group in the gastric bypass surgery had dropped more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased the haemoglobin to A1c by more (3.1 % and 2.1 %) and had more likely achieved the complete diabetic remission (46.9 % and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenixin Blackstone says that although the research shows no survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where the surgery led to a longer life of more powerful people.
The Swedish study found that over-the-stricken over-stricken carnivores had 29% lower probability of dying during the 15-year period when compared to a group that had experimented with more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The results are crucial in demonstrating that the surgery is safe for the lower body weight index, and do not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their physicians should take weight very seriously at the time of patient BMI between 27 and 30.
\"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously,\" she says.
I believe that after man has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
- All can't come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees' home countries.
Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech, which she held at the Dalai Lama Centre for Competition in Oxford, at the opening of her ten-day visit to Britain.
Dalai Lama claimed that, under the present circumstances, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continental parts.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admirable, it is also insufficient.
Everyone can't come to Europe, he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how these Muslims can bring real peace and real development, mainly through education.
The last thing we need to do is think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
Use of power has never solved these problems, he added.
In his position on the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's action following the 911 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused the violent events of the chain.
After the king in 911, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem could be found through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength, and it created unexpected consequences, and Dalai Lama said.
During the last four years, the swallowing of children’s hand disinfectant has increased fourfold.
The poisoning data centres across the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 % in the number of children under 12 years of age in the treatment of alcohol-containing hand-infectants, reports Georgia's poisoning data center.
According to the director of Georgia's poison data center, according to doctor Gaylord Lopez, cases of disinfectant swallowing in children under 12 years of age have risen from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
\"The children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them go to the emergency room,\" Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
On YouTube, there are videos where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap upholstery.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcohol to obtain a stronger drink.
The scents of a pleasant disinfectant can attract younger children.
The kid doesn't think it's bad for him, did he?
Many of the more interesting (hands) are those that have been added to the scent.
There are manic, grape and orange-based disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain alcohol at any rate between 45 % and 95 %.
In particular, small children need only a few injections for alcohol poisoning.
\"It's a really concentrated alcohol,\" says Mr. Stephen Thornton, head of hospital care at the University of Kansas Hospital, who told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey shot at the table, but you leave the hand-defining agent visible, and if you kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who, for some time, swallowed only four injections of Strawberry products into the hands of disinfectants in school, and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult wheel drink limit, says Chris Ritchey, a first-aid police doctor, who handled a girl outside of Atlanta at the Gwinnet Medical Center.
Nhaijah, when speaking with your moss, he couldn't walk when he arrived for first aid.
Doctors followed him over the night in a separate children's hospital for possible symptoms of brain injury because the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told.
\"It was really scary,\" said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
It could have been a deadly situation for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and remove disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died from swallowing into the hands of disinfectants containing toxic, unannounced ingredients.
Health authorities consider that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourth graders designed to poison their teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and denied its class.
The police need to stop the plan from poking around and leave disciplines around the school district.
Hello, Celic has no crossword puzzles.
Griffiths reduces the speeches about the Crusades of Celtic, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but he's going to make it turn around.
Hearts fights the Scottish football union against Neilson's accusations, and Warburton is prepared for January's recruitments that could interfere with the team's unity.
Dons raised his lead in Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory in Hamilton at the Pittodri Stadium and allowed the team to increase the gap to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths makes little talk about Crusades
There have been rumors about celtic's internal clashes, but Griffiths passed them immediately. He claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under a more accurate eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, but I think players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship is boring the Dutch - but Boer
Former Rangers middle field player and former Dutch national team leader Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition from the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said: \"There will be no more Celtic's games in the Netherlands and why...
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tensions, and also non-Scotlands want to follow those games.
Deila swears she'll turn around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn around.
The loss to Malmö and its resulting fall from the Master's league was quickly followed by the loss of ten men to Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series with five points apart from the next.
But Dela said, \"Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again,
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are well, very angry or sad about what happens.
We are, too, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburto is on guard for January players' transfers
Even though Rangers-pomo Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets for January's transfer, he's on his guard to ensure that he doesn't want to mix the team with the consensus.
The former Brentford boss said: “The moving window in January is very different from that in the summer window.
In the case of players coming in summer, the adaptation time is the first time throughout, which will be shown in our team this period.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes increasing unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest target Michu's hint of retirement
Swansea's attacker, Michu, whose name is attached to the transfer window in connection with Celtic, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankles for two years, and he was unable to find a new follow-up outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish football union because of Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost 3-2 after this. The sider's red card was cancelled later, and this was already the third red card that Collumi condemned in the last eight months.
Neilson remains behind his message, saying: \"I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance,
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernia player became boastful of the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel when he was given a song of insult.
The incident took place in the pub, Edinburgh Roseburn, before Edinburgh derbya Tynecaslö Stadium in March 2014.
The attacker added: “It is safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle, unless you move to Celtic,
The Tannadic government believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the government of Dundee United still has faith in the management team's ability to reverse the situation, but admits that the loss of players must be over.
I think Stephen Thompson is counting on us.
We're gonna fix the boys again, Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about the win-win-in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Acities, but he managed to reach the top five points above Celtic because of Adam Rooney's first penalty kick.
McInnes says: “There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a trophy or a league that would not have won the games in this way,
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom’s total
EMPLOYMENT IN Scotland remained at 164,000 in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Great Britain rose to 1.82 million in a total of 10,000 people.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK by 5.5 per cent, the figures of the National Statistics Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of jobs now amounts to 2,612 000.
In the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland decreased to 74 per cent, which is higher than the UK average by 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundoll commented on these latest figures: \"The long-term management plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy,
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I testify to the execution in Oklahoma?
If no legal intervention takes place, I will see to it later today when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'm sitting on the viewers' press in Oklahoma State Penitentiary, watching Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He's asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to feel bad about this day when it comes to it.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
The suppliers, of course, have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free locations, participants are selected through an awful value.
Oklahoma has reduced the places reserved for the media to twelve five.
Whoever's chosen will be looking at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created him through calls made over the months of my contacts and a two-hour and half-hour visit.
I like him.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to save what I've seen.
I just have to try and remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter that I've been compromised on my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you'll be able to attend.
I complained to the reporter.
But I still think what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I have said and what I have written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I won't do it if he says so.
I've told him that he can remove me from his list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be present, who's writing about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post's reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to a series of podcast transmissions I've made.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions, after the murder of Barry Van Treese, would in any case make him arson.
But I believe that there is a very strong opportunity for him not to commit murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And this is the point where I see him die.
I can't claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other suppliers here who will take care of it.
I'm gonna give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like dies superfluously.
The man was lured out of the Canning River River after a watery police station.
Officer Canning Vale remained dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the police from his heels went wrong when he found himself in a low, muddy water only meters away from a police officer who tried to give him a gentle look back to the beach.
The Canning Vale police called on Tuesday because of the illegal intrusion of Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, this tried to distract them by heading into the Canning River River.
But he didn't get very far.
He was standing in the water, saying, \"I'm not coming out, come get me,\" said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used safer tactics:
People do funny things when they try to escape, told senior sergeant Castledine.
Master football player Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired the locals to begin the playful Ben Cousins biathlon design.
Peter Moody claims that the contractors tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's suppliers tried to infiltrate his deposits last year and threaten to stop competing immediately.
He blames the actors and the Racing Victoria Independence Division, claiming that they have a personal campaign going against him. On Wednesday Lady Tatai's late rejection of the treatment on the day of the race was the last rivet.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has faced a difficult situation after Lidar's unexplainable positive cobolt sample.
He has kept his tongue under control over spy claims for one and a half years, and he did not want it to look like envy.
I didn't mean to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything comes out at a time, so Moody said.
They knew things were going on.
Sometimes all I have to do is react and live with penalties, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to run with my head up, and I want my owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I must no longer continue as coach.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm gonna do with my license.
In the past, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were in the room with a man who named him when he asked me and offered him a job with my record if he cared about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
Well, if that's the case, they'd be happy to break up their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, the former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Modie, the current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Sanundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I begin to think this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man, and perhaps to transfer responsibility to other than the coach?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I don't think at all that the things I'm saying now may make them think about it.
But I'm now at the point where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has increased with a long-term study of Lidar’s cobbots, and late rejection has led him to find that he could – and he could – throw his license over the table –
Moody, who is best known for the training of the undefeated master Black Caviar, has called the day-to-day treatment rule to be ridiculed after the mud or clay disease has been placed on the feet of the horse which is irregular.
It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that, he said.
One of my employees made a mistake to bury it in his leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, like it was.
It was on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month competition ban due to the day of the race, from which the operators started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about a horse.
\"All of us understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,\" Moody said.
In Cobram, a driver who has been arrested for the escape of traffic
The police have arrested a man who was forced to flee the city after he ran into a biker this weekend in Cobra.
A biker was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital when he received serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me the driver ran away and stopped to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to a police officer in Sheppard.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failure to provide assistance, and of other traffic offences.
A biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Team Coach Craig Bellamy attacking competitors in the struggles
The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two NRL-rugbyligiga's master's claims that his team's fights would be part of the line.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the EMTs allowed the Storm button on his own side when suddenly he won the final run in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely hid his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the final stake. Bennett called the game Rugbyligiga's play screen and said that the two Queensland teams weren't very excited about the button.
Bellamy defended his team's fights and said that they were just focused on the contact, in a coat.
Bellamy added that her trust added two leading coach criticisms to Storm, because it means they are afraid to lose to the team.
I never heard Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost them 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have only stressed our contact in the fights, and it has made us successful.
Trent's been on the team for three years, and he's obviously got a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this always comes to talk at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of an intense rugby by reminding her mentor that the St. George Illawarra Dragons trained by Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing so boringly...
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was, Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said that it couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play a rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its type of players.
He brought it up on half of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style rugby - not who the team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I'm going to be more confident when they say things like this because they're a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roosters was more precise than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was between 20 and 18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense and no goal?
It's about the lines to me.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
The Storm is free this weekend because they have already won a home game either from North Queensland Cowboys or from Cronulla Sharksja next Saturday night at the pre-final AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Serb man gets a $20,000 guarantee on drug charges.
A man threatened with a possible life-long life-long transfer of 40 pounds of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released against a guarantee of $200,000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to Solay Hunt, who came to South America through the Old Aged and graduated from Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other accused on a boatport all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Tokyo Echo car.
Although Maksimovic is threatening a possible life-long trial of holding a quantity of cocaine, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount of drugs and that he could have been at the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
He's got close connections to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place he lived in.
The mother and stepfather of Maximovic had offered a guarantee of $200,000 to ensure his release.
After counting the evidence of both persons, it is clear that setting up a guarantee of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them, Judge Flanagan said.
But on his own, it was not enough to stop him from showing up in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he will deliver his passport both in Australia and in Serbia, to report daily to the police and to stick to his ban on night-to-day migration.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to attract pedophiles to send photos
The paedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone when asking for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while sleeping and then logged in to the online communication service, where Hogg received a number of homeless photos of children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, found her phone missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She looked into her phone and found the shocking messages, and then she told her mother immediately.
When the police came, they saw five photos, looked at the computers on the ground, and found a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, web searchable searchables, used to look for pictures of unsuspected pictures taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to pedophile on the Internet before he was presented to the police to scare them.
The Fiscal Depositary, Eilith Robertson, told the Dundeen Sheriff's Court: “He said that this was an addition - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had performed the grave on the computer but said that they were only made because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare pedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him pictures and when Hogg asked him to send more pictures.
Hogg said he did this just for bait purposes.
He said that when he got drunk, he was sick and he wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When she found the pictures of her phone, she cried for her mother, she was shaking and crying.
My mother saw the unscrupulous photos on the phone, and then she met the accused.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to the girls who looked younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg at Ward Road Dundee admitted his guilt in the preparation or taking pictures of unscrupulous children last June 14th, in violation of the sentence on 25 January of this year and in the absence of a court hearing on 24 March of this year.
The defense lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to be included in the register of sexual offenders, because it can be claimed that his crime was not part of a sexual element,
Sheriff Alistair Carmichaal postponed the sentence to October so that social action has time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is under arrest before processing.
He was added to the sex offender register before the date of judgment.
Robert Mugabe from Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell on the leading stairs of the speaker.
He wasn't injured, but the video of his fall spread like the virus in social media.
Parliament's opening statements were also made by opposition legislators that they had been sent anonymous killing threats that warned them not to call Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, they buffed and interrupted him during the interlocutors when he held a speech on the state of the country to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group supervisor Innocent Gonese said text messages from seven opposition politicians who warned them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
“The number from which the message was sent is not answered, but the title of the message is 'death', ” he told journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message warned the relevant Members that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they came out, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is, in its care, concerned about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cuts efforts in the business services business.
Later this year HP will be divided into two listed companies, distinguishing their computer and printer business from faster-growing hardware and service activities.
The expected job cuts bring around $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, the HP release said.
“These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise, ” noted Meg Whitman, the president of HP and the CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the present-HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that help companies move to new business, Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over USD 50 billion, and it focuses on producing non-compatible integrated technology solutions – companies, reports the company's information.
The division breaks down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from the University of Stanford University, started in the 1930s to produce electrical equipment.
HP's been through a huge reorganization to find out about the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and is one of the largest technology figures in the USA, and its distribution is the latest sector based on belief that strictly limited companies are better performing.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb tie.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now and assuming that he is going to be rehabilitation according to plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, at least four English games remain between Wilshir, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championship next summer.
The greatest pity for this last problem is that Wilsher's end of the last period was strong after a more isolated ankle, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career, Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as also Wenger admitted, the player’s attempt to return through the past is always at an additional risk of injury.
There is also an uncomfortable model in shape.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshe had 23 different injuries after she was debited six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years he has played 157 league games in only 65 games.
In view of the wider picture of Arsenal after the period 2007-08, for six out of eight periods, it has been one of the Valolitiga teams who have lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits it's a witch's career, but Arsenal believes that their last-year improvement will continue with the statistics on disability.
\"Jelv\" when coming back from the injury can be an early period when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition, Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will be stabilised, I am sure that it will work, and that he will be given the career that he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his league game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then on Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on the initiative.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
I'm trying to maintain balance and give a break to the players who need it, Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the clear extension of the F block, Europe is the scariest in Maximir Stadium Zagreb.
Dinamo has not lost 41 games since they produced their own - Undefeated - campaign in the last period.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was rocked by an earthquake, which was 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was a tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenge believes that Arsenal has learned from the last season of the Master's league's surrender to Monaco, and he was still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
This motivation is huge, Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand we are realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not ghosts.
FriendsFest: Comedy Series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is remarkable to note how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In 2015, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced a problem for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from applying for help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
In a recent study, more than 2,000 upper secondary and upper secondary school students showed signs of depression. According to the study, a person’s ability to recover doubled, if a high enough percentage of his friends were in good health,
Similarly, those who were not depressed shared the likelihood of having any mental health problems when they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
Through this social media in the time of communication, the style goes past content, and the directity of the answer is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need for strong, happy and successful, even though really isolation rules.
The values governing this surface-side success, which psychologists call externality: money, image, social status. All this happens to internal values - internal longing for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of our mental health.
And as the billionaire video player has recently explained, money is certainly not getting any greater happiness.
The fineness of Frendie was that it turned this focus on its head.
No characters defined their work, but rather their personalities, who were clearly separated from the interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, the moments in their fancy chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel, their sense of humor became aware of the fact that yes, men can identify themselves with all this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans volunteer worker explained to me: ... ... when listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve feeling,
Often the men who contact us will experience that they cannot speak to friends.
It's strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you'll be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of a man-to-man friendship.
Although my impartial, external position on the other side of the phone helps people at times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And then if you're going to come to Comedy Central to FriendsFest this weekend, and all the scenes are redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends to the coffee at Central Perk.
Or what's even better if you see someone alone in Starbucks smile and say hello.
You never know how much friendship you can mean.
Frends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes the goal and helps the PSG hit the Malmö sideways
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan paints against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria painted the Master's League in her debut, helping the PSG to bypass the Swedish team on Malmö's Tuesday.
Under the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain started his Master's League game in the end with a nice 2-0 victory against Malmo in Parc des Princess on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Master's League's debut in her goal less than four minutes, pointing the way for the French league masters, but the team lost many opportunities before finally increased their lead in Cavan's strike by 61 minutes.
Paris, which is in the same section of the A, with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, because the game was not just a secondary, but also a improvement in their quarter-final-leading games in the last three rounds.
But even though the PSG took the points, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibramovic, lost the spot in front of the goal and later switched from the field. Malmo is his old hometown team and the team where he started his great career in 1999.
“It is not easy to win at home or in guests in the league of the masters, so the 2-0 win creates problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it is a good start, even though there are things that we have to do this period, ” Blanc said.
This is good for you.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though I'm sorry that we didn't make one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibraimivic returned to the Paris team for one of the three changes since the team was left in the 2-2 match game in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux for the weekend, but stayed in the fourth minute in Di Maria's shadow.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, a Argentinan paratrooper was named a man who would take the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why Marco Verratt's pitch ran behind Malmö's defense line and then hit the beautiful finalisation of Johan Wiland's web corner.
However, if someone expected the PSG to win easy and big, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a stumpy opponent. It won the Celtic solution when he reached this level, with nine international players in the opening field and a five-man defense and two players in the deep middle field.
But on the attack side, the team offered only a shot at Nikola Djurdjic for 34 minutes, which passed the button by Kevin Trapp's paint pole.
Instead, at times due to lost input and bad finishing, the PSG had failed, especially in five companies, only in the first half of the year and then became disappointed when Cavani put the ball in contact with Ibramovic immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working his colleagues, and Di Maria just sent a tour of Ibramovic's feed, which was tilted around Wiland's paint pole in 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally reached after one hour's game, thanks to the sixth goal of the season of the French Cavan after Ibramovic had pushed forward Maxwell's crucifix from the left.
Malmo's wishes to get back into the game ended, and only Wiland's great fight for David Luis' direct kick was to keep the final numbers down before the Ezequiel Lavezz goal of the exchange was completely rejected at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team.
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
I don't think we're gonna have enough fights.
I'll pick up the hat for Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore collects 2.5 billion dollars for the sale of shares

Glencore, listed at the London Stock Exchange, reported that it had sold new shares in order to reduce its debt to around EUR 1.6 billion.
A company that lost 57% of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of the degraded basic goods, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy puts pressure on demand and causes damage to all markets.
The new label was raised by Glencore's stock at the top of the London Stock Exchange in the morning shops.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131,60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore, as part of the 2.5 billion dollar stock trade, had revealed its wider plan to cut the debt burden of USD 30 billion by about a third of the previous week.
A new share capital was sold by the company with 125p, which meant a reduction of 2.4% on Tuesday at the final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent from the merger.
Concerning long-term Chinese growth, iron ore prices have been cut by around half, while at the same time prices for coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed in the White House's opinion on Tuesday.
X's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's last visit to Beijing, the opinion was stated.
The President of the United States and the wife of the President Michelle Obama will arrange for a dinner with X and his spouse, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
\"The visit of Mr X allows us to extend cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively matters where there are differences,\" he added in the resolution.
At a visit that was published for the first time in February Xin is also expected to deviate from Seattle on his way to Washington before he continues towards New York City and the United Nations General Assembly of September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern regarding China's alleged online spying and the country's increasing presumption of independence in the South China Sea's controversial waters.
Matt Damon ignores the difference in filming
Matt Damon and Effie Brown, an African-American film maker, took together when they talked about the difference that Damon said was not necessary behind the scenes.
In the Sunday evening of HBO, the actor who had experienced the Project Greenlight episode interrupted Brown with this emphasis on the need for different perspectives as regards the project's selected manuscript for the dark-faced main person.
When we talk about the difference, it takes into account when choosing actors in the film, not in the series, Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted unbeliefly, with comments on \"Oh! Wow. Okay, while the Martian actor's comments were stuck in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series of finalists.
I want people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's personal character, Brown said it was the beginning.
The only dark figure is a whore that's hit by his white pimp.
The Dear White People's producer demanded that the film be directed to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon very much replied that their guidance could end up giving us something we do not want to do.
When the debate was sent, the social media exploded to disprove Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPoon expressed his anger at the film play, writing: “Matt Damon speaking over the only dark person in the room and explaining the difference between what happened to him is NIKON
After their publication, the Twitest collected more than 5,000 retwicts and 4000 tricks.
Damon's comments hit the time when a precise racial presentation on the media is in the interest of social debate.
After the white police killed a teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread to land and called on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the year’s album candidates as the winner of the Grammy Prize.
The Albums still matter, he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter recently published an opinion to answer the question of Fox News's TV face, Elisabeth Hassselbeck, whether a group should be considered a hate group.
\"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group, the leaders said.
In addition, Damon was reported to be involved in it among the entertainers, producers, and media modules, who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the Catholic Church picture in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
The First American Ninja Mayor crowned
In Monday, the first athlete from Isaac Caldiero, who won the American Ninja Warrior, and won a million-dollar prize.
The competition programme, which has just decided on its seventh period, has never been a competitor who would have survived all the obstacles to the programme.
In the last section of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last task was to climb about a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Brittten first climbed and resolved the challenge on time, which made him the first athlete of all time to solve the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior. Caldiero, however, solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after the hard-earned victory and was still in shock for winning the million-dollar grand prize.
It's great to think that I've never earned or lived as much as I've had $10,000 a year, but Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... you can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Production Manager Kent Weed sat down to discuss the final list with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten won't get more reward money, even though he's the first competitor of all time who has managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time, Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and a change of life, he still gets a great feeling of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels sorry for that.
He's just so happy he's been able to do what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family father.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, \"If someone had to win me, I'm happy that it was Isaac.\"
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
The other half of the season hasn't been very funny to Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was one of the best baseball teams sometimes, but is now the last one in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played the full role of the spoiler on Tuesday when he won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in the Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to get up on the gamer's head from Houston Astros in the second American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was at least one night to return to the six - letter H - word, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
All the winnings are fun, no matter how they get them, the Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus said.
The pitcher of Tigers, Alfredo Simon, continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two turns, followed by once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in turn and released three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
I just want a strong ending for this year, Simon said.
It's hard for a changer to play every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' replacement, Victor Martinez, hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
This was the first three night of Martinez's punching after four times that he hit Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
- He was very good at the paint, Ausmus said.
He looked good (in betting exercises), looked much better at punching exercises and continued with the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind the second half of the seventh pair, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Centeri Byron Buxton started the rotation by hitting twice out on the left field line.
On the right side of Aaron Hicks went into one nest with a finger, and Simon got burned straight to another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only one against the player, the pre-starting vice president Miguel Sana, who was pulling two nests from the left right-hand Drew VerHagen.
With two runners in the field and a level-level runner in the second pair, VerHagen got the triple twig Trevor Ploffen to hit the double-roller.
It was the main series record: 27 times this period when Plouffe hit the double.
After Detroit had received a lifelong run at the ninth start, Mauer would kick out two beaten runs for Tigers' closure against Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
The real-handed player, however, burned the Say in three feeds for his fifth rescue.
At first, the Detroit used Phil Hughes in rusty.
Tigers got three runs in the first two turns against the right-hand veteran player who got out of the list of injured people before the game after being out of bed for more than one month because of the lower back infection.
It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of start, Hughes said, \"but as the game went forward, I was more comfortable, and I felt that I could make a few nice shots on the third turn.
After Hughes caught the beginner's first nest, he let another nest player, Ian Kinsler, move forward one step.
The walking of J.D. Martinez on the right side of two fires brought Victor Martinez, who took himself to the front yard in the middle field and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe with the runners in good running stations.
The third player Nick Castellanos continued to hit the right and caused another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected when he tried to move on to the third base.
Tigers continued with another pair of turns and got one fire, two nests in the situation, a kidnapper from James McCann and two fires, one nest in the situation of the senator Anthony Goelt, and then the situation was 3-0.
- It was an important hit. Paul Molitor, the leader of the Twins team, said.
She didn't hit very well, but she flew to the right side.
Hughes began to be in the pass-by and fed the running-in third gear, after which he replaced himself as a right-handed successor to A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs from six beatings and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-hand pitcher of Tigers, had to be released due to a discharge shoulder discharge.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-July for shoulder arrest, but he had to return on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out there, left-handed feeder Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris's statistics on Tigers are at the 1-1 4th start after the left-handed pitcher David Price switched to him on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20th due to the correct tip of the abdominal muscle.
The three-game series of Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.33 ERA) is against the right-hand feeder Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
The economy should help the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, which is responsible for guiding reform.
\"In the context of the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the reform, China should commit itself to attract foreign funding and expertise and develop transparency policies.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are being driven forward with more movement and vitality and creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Group approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a loosening of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to take up private capital and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and companies which cannot be invested is created.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is significant because it will give the market a greater role in targeting resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government will also loosen its power of control over the companies it distributes, thereby ensuring that companies decide on their own business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to develop regional growth.
In order to open up public sectors to private donors, more areas will be opened.
The management does not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies financed by foreigners and to produce better services for them, the opinion stated.
In addition, the search process will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and reducing the search process for permanent resident permits, green cards.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional training rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were informed in the opinion published after the meeting.
