Four members of the Kemerovo group were held in Estonia and Spain
According to postman, the police held Slava Gulevitch, head of the so-called Kemerovo group in Spain, known in the world of crime, under the name of Slava Kemerovski.
In Spain, Gulevish was arrested with permission from the court.
Yesterday the court also took three suspected arrests in Estonia.
The suspicion is that the so-called Kemerovo Criminal Community members are 27-57 years of age, mainly engaged in drug crimes.
In Mijas, in the province of Malaga, Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was respected.
Three men were held suspect in Estonia, one of whom has been collected according to data is the leading figure of a criminal community and two are members of a criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the criminal offence in the Community was clearly divided into functions and roles.
The purpose of the criminal community was to deal with drug offences and thus earn a criminal income", commented Vahur Verte, head of the criminal proceedings.
"We do not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal matter will increase," added the prosecutor.
It is a question of people who have already been admitted to the law enforcement regime, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues throughout the investigation has been important.
"International cooperation has become normal for us, and this week's operation shows us the success of this cooperation", commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that pre-examining for almost a year and a half had lasted.
"In the first half of this week, the long-term work was realistic, and we held on to suspicions of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
He added that the officials of the Central Criminal Police were helpful in holding him in Spain.
For years we have been in good contact and understanding of the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These detentions are another message for criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that, while they were in prison, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecution applied for arrest and the court also accepted it.
A man arrested in Spain expects his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal matter, immovable property, vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure seizure.
Pre-criminal proceedings shall be conducted by a central criminal police office and run by the state prosecutor.
The City Court of Tallinn condemned Slava Gulevitch in 2005 and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, after Nikolai Tarankov, Gulevish, a man was considered to be important in the world of crime.
Gulevitch, from Kemerovos, was brought up in Estonia at the beginning of the 1990s when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded monthly roofing fees for businessmen.
International joint operations, seizures of criminal income and in force judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, recent judgments, the eight defendants of the so-called Dikayev criminal society, who were arrested for 80 000 euros, or nine persons, in that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trafficking of secret cigarettes and the execution of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in East Virginia and South Estonia.
The amount of seized criminal income is around 71 500 euros.
In these criminal matters, progress has been made to ensure that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out activities in any EU country.
The Civil Rights Group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned people travelling to Missouri about the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
The Group's statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the State of Missour, valid until August 28 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and Mizourists to be particularly careful and extremely cautious when moving around the whole state, taking into account the whole race's suspicious racial events, which have recently taken place in the state and are also highlighted here."
According to NAACK, the group was encouraged to issue both the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win discrimination cases and also the fact that the targets of the state's irregular agents are unevenly minority.
"The rights of citizens are violated.
They are drawn on the road because of their skin color, beaten or killed," said the NAACP Missouri branch president of Rod Chapel to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received so much complaints before."
This is the first warning issued by the organisation for the US State.
The group referred to events such as racist insults on the direction of black students at Missouri University and Tennessee, the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he got through the state when he ran out of gas, and Missouri's police arrested him without being accused of a crime.
Furthermore, the remark refers to a recent report by the Attorney General General of Missour, which shows that cars of black drivers in the state are being suspended by 75% more likely than those of whites.
"The idea is to keep people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"Man must be ready, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they pass through the state."
On the basis of the latest data in the F.B.I. notification programme, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which will place the state at 16th section in terms of the number of similar infringements.
Travel alert is also the answer to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to sue a company in search of housing or work for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travel comments on Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws which obliged local people to arrest for immigration violations, as according to ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually issue travel warnings for other countries, but recent interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What would anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, or hepatitis, may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may continue to develop into cirrhosis of the liver, i.e., liver depression and liver cancer, are at low risk.
Epidemiology advisor Kulio Kutsar says that signs of acute hepatitis are similar for all types of hepatitis - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of skin and mucosal tissues.
The last sign of disease is also due to the popular designation of inflammation of the liver.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
A variety of types of hepatitis can be identified only on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and go for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver’s disease.
Kuulo Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes how they go.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from infected people's stools to arms and hands on food, surfaces, objects, mouth and drug use.
The members and carers of the patient’s family are members of the risk group of hepatitis infection, persons suffering from chronic liver disease, people having an infection, men having sex with men, drug users, people visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented in vaccines, in particular vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and those who are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are important: washing or disinfecting hands, before using food, wash all fruit and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are common in the presence of a sick person in contact with the blood, injection, tattooing, opening, use of blood-infected glands (swellings, shavers), donor blood, sex with a patient of the hepatitis, and hepatitis from mother to foetus/vascine.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, infected sex partners, men having sex with men, newly born mother, sick family members and carers, health workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high levels of disease in hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B it is possible to vaccinate people; it is recommended, in particular, that people with a risk group and those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
The other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: to avoid the use of animal hygiene and manicure devices, other sharps and injection needles, tattooing and resuscitation, and to prevent the use of condoms in the event of potentially harmful sex or sexual behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national vaccination plan in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are common in contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, opening, use of blood-infected glands, donor blood, sex with the patient of the hepatitis, and the mother of the hepatitis to the foetus/vascine.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, infected sex partners, men having sex with men, newly born mother, sick family members and carers, health workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, people with HIV infection, and passengers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: to avoid the use of animal hygiene and manicure devices, other sharps and injection needles, tattooing and resuscitation, and use of condoms in the event of potentially contagious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which is multiplied by hepatitis B virus presence.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a super infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D hepatitis viruses spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, with the syringes needles contaminated with them, by sexual route and by the rarely infected mother to the foetus.
D The risk group for hepatitis B is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and those who are not immune to hepatitis B.
The effective prevention measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects the person against hepatitis D virus infection.
E hepatitis viruses spread by fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low heat treated animal meat, fish and marine carnations, donor blood, co-administered syringes and infected mothers to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with a high disease.
The prevention measures for this hepatitis are hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the bathroom, before cooking and eating, after treating the patient.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid a low heat treated animal meat, fish and marine feed, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although in the last round, competitors tried to push a four-time Olympic winner off the track, Farah was 34 years old and won 26.49,51.
Farah did not think long, drawing her husband Tania and children along the road after the finalis.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the road with them," said Farah to journalists.
Farah is targeting the fifth title race in London, and it's going to be 5,000 and 10,000 metres of gold doubs.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title of Anne-Marie O'Connor, "Daam gold." Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait is an extraordinary story", from the birth history of a work of art to a much deeper cultural life in the late 19th century and early 20th century.
But even more in-depth.
It would have been a lot more expensive to get to know the most famous information, or the harder the track, the narrower the theme would have allowed the portrait to have more influence on the extraordinary story of the title.
At present, it would be like two books between one cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer and a much larger and more comprehensive history book of respected Jewish families and German occupation, along with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to Vienna’s cultural life in the middle of the city of Austria, and who himself had become the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was around Ringstra, or how everything in Central’s cafe turned around when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultures was high in one of Europe’s richer cities, and when you see the name in the book you feel more culturally.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where he was incurable in syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, makes progress as if nothing was added.
Or, perhaps, each paired brush strap adds colors to cultural life in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
Dream of Travel to the Soviet Union
In recent decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
On the turn of the century, almost ten people of Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele got married twice, she was positating Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But from Adele, the entire glamour of his life, where he belonged, was not drawn.
When you look at "Ma in gold", it's hard to believe that the end of life was infected by this great lady of socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, he was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt’s order was paid at the time for 4000 kroons, one quarter of the price of a well-placed country house.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of a master's love story model did not discourage the sugar magnet.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that was created in the course of the work continued for the rest of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor-- "Dam gold.
Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait’s extraordinary story, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the work began with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravennas San Vitale in the Basilica, and researchers believe that it was there that the magnificent Muslims, the Emperor of Theodora, had given the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a colored mosque.
Klimt presented his "Dam in gold" in Vienna in 1908, and about the same time (in 1907, 1908) was born in another golden land called "Sudlus".
Art historians did not miss the similarity of two women.
What about Hitler?
"I think that to commemorate my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public", said Adele Bloch-Buuer, a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family of Klimt's collection would go to the museum.
Six years before he died, he had made another portrait of Adele in Klimt.
In his will (Ale left February 1925), he also asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four landscapes of Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
His jewelry was inherited to his nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had completed "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts to 17-year-old Adolf Hitler but failed to draw.
Although sometimes considered Hitler’s subsequent anti-Semitism to be the reason that the Jewish professors did not accept him at the academy, none of his examiners actually were Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria’s will, had changed considerably by 1939 - the discovery of good works by the Nazi parties of Vienna’ rich Jewish art collections had become important.
Hitler’s personal artistic assets were also suited to some work at Adele’s home, but not to the own of Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery began a ten-year trial between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
At this point, let's just say that if "Suudlus" sees Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Dame Gold" must be seen in New York's Neue Gallery.
And before we go to Vienna, read the book mentioned above.
Even when you go to Klimt's work, you don't plan to, because at least my emotions turned around after the book was closed, more Nazi and Jewish themes than the painting and model of Adele Bloch-Buuer sold for 135 million dollars.
So, not so much a portrait, rather than a story of family destiny - and very touching.
The Bauer family tree at the beginning of the book made it clear that the events would facilitate orientation.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the frontal swimming, Gold was very close to his own 200-metre personal record swimming 2.16.62.
Tippmark dates back to 17-year-old peaks from a week's membership, when Canada won the Summer Championship at 2.16.58, the Priit Aavik Swimming blog.
Gold last got to the final, maybe 10th of the A-fine.
In the final he passed the distant time of 2.15,76 and reached a good seventh place with a new powerful top stamp.
Alina Kendzior’s Estonian record (2.15.13) remained a little over half a second away from Gold.
In the Estonian edition of all time, Gold rose third, and his fresh personal top brand is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still starting at Canada's adult championships of 100 m, 200 m and 400 m, and in the 200 m and 400 m of complexion.
Last week at the Canadian Junior Championships in Toronto and Gold made successful stars there.
He won 200 m in the flood with silver medal at 2.03.22.
This was so quickly flooded by the distance Estonians last in 2008.
In Estonia, only Estonian record designer Elina Parjóka has been swimming this distant since the time of Gold.
In Canada, the Estonians still won the pronksmedal 100 m of freedom with excellent personal record and the new Estonian season’s top mark 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnak, a year older than him, has been swimming this distant for only one century more quickly.
Up to his personal peak, he arrived at another 100 m in his browser when he received a letter in the opening of the swimsuit at 1.03.69.
On half the longer distance, he reached only the seventh place when swimming in the finals 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season’s senior table on four different distants.
President Trump is on vacation, critics feed his teeth.
It's time for rest - that also means relaxation for the President of the United States Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the greatest presidents of holiday days, critics are already feeding teeth.
According to U.S. Today and CNN, the president plans a 17-day vacation at his own name golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, the opposition to Trump's holiday has been taking place for a week.
They throw too often at Trump.
It is known as the president's custom to spend weekends in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump has not rested most during his 196th term of office.
For example, George W. Bush was on vacation in that time for 67 days, and Barack Obama was half less than Trump, only 21 days.
But it's gonna make Trump feel like he's gonna forget it.
Read days after being president Trump said, "60 minutes," that for long vacations, there will be no time left in his office, as much time will be needed.
He also published three years ago the bad news about Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote that on Twitter: "At the time Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS journalists are cutting heads off."
According to the White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
It is officially referred to as a leave to work, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other activities.
In addition, work leave had to have another reason.
The White House’s western air conditioning system is being replaced and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
There is also Ovalakabinnet and other president's premises in the west wing.
"I do not think that any of you would like to be on the west wing in August if there are 38 degrees and there is no air conditioning", said Lindsay Walters, spoke of the White House, who stressed that the president would continue to work on vacation.
From where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll find out about the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the State Office if you do not tolerate voter criticism
The father of our country knew a lot about the harmful media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn't take long to start squeezing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, he was upset by criticism.
But he didn't make his critics silent.
Because in 1783 Washington said "freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and in dark and quiet, we can be led, like sheep, into killings."
It'll bring me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who'll have to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts who published their opinions on their official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (CLU) sued him.
The governor's office embroiled the action, and the webcommentarials failed to resist the style of "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does.
And it matters more than a man like Hogan.
It is amazingly popular with the Republican Governor in a predominantly democratic state.
His acceptance rate is above the top of 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not an unthinking reaction to the painhead.
He has led the state on a firm hand and has remained firmly established to his principles.
In addition, he has used his main tool to communicate with his voters quite fluctuate on Facebook, for example, following his chemotherapy for the first time with a lazy helmet head.
Therefore, the governor’s newspaper is a public forum with official markings, managed by the blocking of people visiting taxpayers’ dollars is unnecessary and, ultimately, dangerous.
Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chase, defended the conduct of the governor in the interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing but a modalisation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of the web-swimming Internet trolls, smugglers or hate-filled people.
The Post talked to a number of real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they're real people who communicate with their chosen leaders.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thought-out, and not hangs.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasising Hogan’s catholic traffic.
A lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, Lakshmi Sarma Raman, did not encourage anger, but rather hate crime.
"I kindly commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's newsletter comment box.
"I also do not like the idea that if many people comment on the same subject, one of them immediately calls it a collective effort, rather than admit that it is a great deal of concern for citizens."
What the governor's office called "a targeted spam attack" would probably be called "public support" by others.
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than the old times when workers had to be sent out to do the same so that they would collect and burn or arrest the protesters and make them quiet.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for dissecting Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments with a labeled meaning on this matter was made last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris decided that the head of the Loudoun County Supervisory Board broke the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the elector from his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter after using Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect as on the Internet.
In the period 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers doubled, and anonymous writers summed up his mode of conduct.
And even then, Washington had to breast-feed with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington’s decisions on the ground.
According to the historical documents collected in the framework of the online collection of letters from George Washington, he was buried under petitions from his office, which criticised his views on the agreements with Britain for friendship, trade and shipping.
But he didn't make them quiet.
Freedom of expression, differences and debates are the foundations of our country.
And the right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to the comfort of the territory of the Renaissance Club.
For the next three days, Ronan Rafferty will expect comfort in the home area if 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the Renaissance Club's golf trails in East Lothian.
The Northern Irish who had been leading Paul Eales on the archerfield Links tracks in the neighborhood last year before the announcement to Paul Eales, has started the new venue and will play a part in the tournament instead of Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club.
"I saw the renaissance club built, and now we see how the club with this event in its full glory shines," said Rafferty.
"The travelers see the track in their best form, it's in a glorious state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and he's proud of what's been achieved here.
This will enable the track to be perfectly presented."
England's Eales is looking forward to protecting the championship for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It sends a very special feeling," said a player in Southport.
"I could not protect my Extramadura Open title because it was taken a year after my winning calendar.
It's magical to come back to this can.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will always wear in the heart."
Gary Orr, who joined the European tour of seniors, will return to the finish of the year when he received 50.
It is his first event in Scotland after his participation in 2013 in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"The home to play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburg's man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time you feel extra voltage.
I've replayed the hugely enjoyed and shown quite a decent golf game.
"I'm satisfied with the way things have been going."
The former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the Trio.
Orr and former captain of Ryder Cup Sam Torrance is two of the six warriors in the competition, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and the car parking costs a car with one passenger 5 pounds and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and death in a golden land of Indonesia
If Bardina Dege's making dinner, she won't use the stove.
He's even using pot rarely.
In the wooden cabin of Enarotal in the capital of the Panian Regent of the province of Papua, Indonesia, the household owner shall place the batate called nota in the local language directly on the fire site.
In half an hour, a light will be removed from the charred tuber and the skin will be washed with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor without furniture and there she also does her daily household chores, for example, washes laundry with cloud water from the surrounding bowels.
The role of the walker is filled with a bucket of roofless rooms.
Since he is the youngest of four women, he is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamia is common here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the village men are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are also soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glance into the Papua Mountains. It is the former Dutch colony, which was joined in Indonesia in 1969 after the nobility of the referendum, in which only 1026 seniors were forced to vote by the eyes of the Egyptian forces.
The movement of the Dutch authorities to their rage quickly against the Jakarta government, which continues to keep the region under its strong control, keeping foreign journalists and human rights supervisors away.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, so that the islands remained on the east side of Papua New Guinea.
In order to get here, the Enarotal is a place that is both far away and abandoned. From Jayapira, the province has to be flown from town to Nabire for 90 minutes and then a five-hour journey will be carried by a rental car.
There is no joint transport.
The city of about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by wells and covered by waved iron roofs, which have transformed the different tone into yellow browns.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have they visited nearly any foreign country.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
The truth also changed others.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, referring to the turban, dark shirt, and a bright skirt, made of paint.
Before that, we wore only the leaves on the body.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of the worst in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's golden earth.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountain province of about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
Freeport only mined around USD 3.1 billion in gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua can be threatened with consumer timber, which is estimated at USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the suffering of the popes because they result in a powerful presence of the Indonesian army.
The study of The New York Times in 2005 showed that Freeport paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including USD 150 000 to a single officer.
The efforts of the popes to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are carried around in love.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 priests have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massive killing of genocide in the mountains of Papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the area.
The 2016 report "We're all losing" by the Birsbane archbishop contains evidence of the brutality committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (a second report is particularly widespread rape and the award of electric shocks) and gross repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the numbers of doctors, because such incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, researcher of Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The Kruvids are even more firmly shut down, as Papua's natural resources have caused the influx of new dwellings from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but democracy is changing, as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Indonesian population-rich Java, Kalimantan, Sumara and Sulawes islands.
The Jaava family dishes sell gado-gado with shrimp and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals can't compete with them.
"The migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local popes," explains Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved on behalf of the province capital to Jayapura.
"Mama-mamas [women] are therefore losing their market share."
President of Indonesia Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, allowed his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and violations of human rights in Papua.
The former carpenter won on his way to Jakarta presidential palace from 29 election districts in Papua, including Panama.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted by Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, only two months after the entry into office of Jokowi in October was in a low state in Panama.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at Enarotal’s fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
The children who came in told them they should turn on the front lights.
According to the local pastor, Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers went into their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the drunk soldiers pursued the children and beat them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the children.
One child, Yulianus Yemio, 16 years old, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election committee building was set on fire and the next day things were even further discussed.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for justice on the football field in front of the local police station and the military control center.
They carried the ceremonial yachts and presented the Waita dance of the Papua mee Pago tribe, where they ran around and simulated the bird song.
Some protesters started throwing rocks at the police and military.
"When the crowd shows more than three times resistance, shoot them down," the official document said TIME, which has been seen in the magazine, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
The oldest person in the town of Kego Koto at Yeremia (56) recognized the threat and called for peace to be preserved by asking the people to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"I was suddenly shot in the left wrist when I was turned around," said TIME to the magazine in her bright colors on the porch of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of money, a lot of fire," he adds.
The local man, Alfius Youw, got a hit three times by a cousin who said he saw him shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was with him," said TIME in the journal of Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Pope police chief inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that he was only subject to the security of his department because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when we are threatened to kill," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistio, Pope of the Police Press in 2015.
"This is a question of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young Protestants were killed and many were injured.
New killings only arrived in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuse that occurred in Papua.
"I'd like to solve this case immediately so it would never happen again in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an external mechanism for the resolution of human rights crimes.
But almost immediately the excuses were also followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
However, Wiranto withdrew his words when speaking with TIME on June 5th, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "All things will be resolved according to the law."
Wiranto, who has been accused of human rights crimes by the United Nations in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 blood independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of Panama accepted such claims with a dark cloud.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Panama are afraid to solve this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he helped him bury the four victims.
"The burial of the dead bodies came from the army looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the locals in the Panian neighbourhood in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when he was mutilated between the villagers and the head of the building company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravinus Douw, who drowned by fishing for a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing cops with stones that the latter responded with warning bills.
But the local say that mobile Brigade (Indonesia Military Police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a great panic, afraid of revenge," said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and saw the entry of injured persons.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the related police officers and the withdrawal of the police's mobile bragat from the region.
Panic has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtless development feeds on the dissatisfaction of many, Danish and damal tribes in the central mountainous region of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Pope's Movement (VPL) army of rebels who, according to their opinion, protects the rights of the popes by conducting attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers in distress.
Some VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military's pretext to protect the sovereignty of the country has been arresting in Panama over recent years and arbitrary detention of thousands of people.
Some of them never show up again.
Panias are known among the people of Papua as a "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A small rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is just as unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves mainly a batate, in addition to some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five Batad fields.
They usually keep most yields for the family, the rest being sold on the local market.
Ten batats cost only 10,000 Indonesian roses (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality has increased between the local popes and the new migrants, which have been numerous since the opening of the new routes at Nabire Airport.
These few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Popes themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Panian Council.
Dissolvedness keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, there will be strict restrictions on external media.
French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were sent out from Papua at the beginning of this year, because "they did not follow the relevant practices", although they had been granted a rare film permit.
Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of Human Rights Watchi Asia, said that no restrictions on reporting have been implemented to promote transparency and development in Jokowi's elections.
"In Indonesia, journalists from the easternmost restless provinces of Papua and from Western Papua are threatening new threats of visa rejection and the inclusion of a black list," he said in his statement.
The lack of a porous view of the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the neighboring neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries encouraged Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands of the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "multiple crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Panama.
These countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Arrmatha Nasir, editor of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dropped charges on the group, saying to journalists: "Indonesia is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch official delegation visited Kees Van Bar on 4 May, the National Commissioner for Human Rights, Jayapura, the local people were interrupted by the meeting but, according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, their silence was urged: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the Popes will not believe that they will vote again in favour of Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved with the shooting of Panama," says Hobai, Chairman of the tribe council.
He wants to give Jokowi an understanding that, in addition to the constant threat posed by the Vegetarian army, the people of Pania are struggling with the misery of the negotiated education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Panama, as well as the other popes, consider their vote to Jokowi as a debt he must pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite alarms and threats, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania were able to do more with their last symbolic counter-intelligence to bury one of the victims' bodies to the country that opposed the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be set on foot, they will at least let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with his reduced head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire swallowed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time.
It came out on Friday through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, making hundreds of residents escape from this 37 meters high and 79-storey building.
It's the second fire that's been firing on a high-strength that happens to be called a Torchi, or a Torviku Tower, for just two years.
The building was evacuated, none of the injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up on fire alarms and yelling at people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," told Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to the Dubai civil defense officers, the firemen erased the flame at around 4 a.m. at local time (00.00 GMT) and swung the building.
The government said they work for victims to guarantee shelter.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used worldwide on high-tech outer surfaces.
The investigation carried out following the fire of Torchi’s Board of Directors in 2015 found that the most damage was caused by ornamental panels and isolation on the outside of fascads.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenfell Tower and the fascade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, where about 80 people were killed.
See: These phones are probably going to be selling chips in the fall
Spring and autumn is a sweet time for technical fans, because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new top models.
In the spring came to the sale of Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, as well as in the autumn it is expected to receive new hit phones for the poets.
According to the TV2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, today's flags are characterised by innovative design, visual scanner, servas-front 4K screen and high speed processor.
There was great excitement in the technology world, Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian Smartphone sales table.
In the autumn, it allows smart people to be even more easily loaded, more durable battery, a more high quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that, on the basis of the reports, you can already make assumptions and predict four top models, which are likely to take over today's sales tables.
These four top smartphone models will reach the poets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the poets already in the middle of September.
Rumors, what a new Apple model looks like, and what you can do with it, spreads a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, it is expected that the new model will be completely distinguished from previous ones for Apple's tenth birthday.
There are four colors spoken: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
The new design is one of the elements of the screen that will cover the entire phone front pane, lost is the home button and the fingerprint reader is built inside the screen.
Apple design manager JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There has also been a ceramic version of iPhone.
A11 processor can be expected to be faster in addition to the eye irritation scanner, wireless loading and a more high-quality camera.
I'm sure this is one year's expected smartphone.
The new model Galaxy Note 8 pre-booking starts on 23 August.
There have been many reports of what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is reported that more business users are designed and that S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower field of vision.
Now no one knows what two back cameras are capable of, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
But we're looking forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has made sales this year with three smartphones at the top of Nokia 6, there are still no flag ships - Nokia 8, which are presented on 16 August.
We look forward to the 5,3-inch edge-to-head screen and ultra-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
For Nokia, there is also talk of aluminium housing and significant levels of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two back cameras produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's solid flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's a little more modest than XZ Premium, but with at least the same good or better camera.
For Sony's new model, it's been predicted that its screen is at least six inches.
As for reality, we can see as soon as possible because Sony has traditionally published his autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
As far as the information on the transscriptions leaked by telephone calls was concerned, Trump put Mexico under pressure on payment for the border wall
The Washington Post announced the reverse phone calls between the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to conclude the public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States sprang on him for public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump made his presidential campaign promise to build a wall along the South border of the United States and swore that Mexico would pay for this project.
Transcripts were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a intense conversation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take on refugees heading towards Australia is 'abominable', 'student' and 'rumal'. He claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama's regime would leave him under the impression of 'juhmardi' because he has proposed a ban on refugees to the United States of America.
Trump ended his speech by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day".
The Court of State did not consider a complaint from OÜ MRP Linna Line in which the City of Tartu rejected their offer for bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
It is a decree rejecting the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Lines on the bus project of Tartu, as the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtn, Head of the City Administration’s Legal Service.
This is the procurement of public bus transport within the City of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP The Linna Lines appealed to the Supreme Court for the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court didn't take care of it.
Although in social media many complain that the noise of Weekend’s festival bothers their night and the entire city is full of drunk partyers, there are also many who have no bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the shops were so polite!
I didn't see any dazzling or rudeness.
Even when I saw kindness," says Laine.
"It's good to be here, to be and to be known for the joy of Pärnu, which is wintertime like winter," he happily adds.
The pyjamas of the shores don't bother Laine's sleep.
When he was living in the city centre, he still heard that music was played on the beach, so now the music has not reached his home food.
"But I hope I hear it," he says joyfully.
Agnes, who also talked about the evening leaves, says that the big festival is more good for Pärnu - it will be a good thing for local traders.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
She doesn't interfere with gay noise.
Although I'm no longer out on the beach, I'm glad the beach's recovered.
And it's nice that the people are moving, and it's been three times already," says the woman.
I guess the first time was a little worse.
"Then perhaps there were complaints," he wonders.
However, the noise on the beach, he said, is common for the summerheads.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri in the park.
The noise and the mow have not hit his life rhythm either.
But what? !
We should all stick together.
Think about how this communication between nations would be better.
A loud music man won't be crushed.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can hold together and no trouble at all," he says.
According to him, visitors to Pärnu are polite.
"The bottles have, of course, been slightly exaggerated, but the young are young and the Lord God - let go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
By this time, coastal residents have traveled somewhere away, either to relatives or to strangers.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on people - people like this noise," says Tiina, who walks with the children of Pärnu.
Neither does his family’s dream of festival music interfere, although last year it came even further than today.
Last summer, there was a different stage, so we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves, that it actually returns to the far river Pärnu pretty well," he says.
Pearson cuts to 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalize business
On Friday, the British educational company Pearlon said that it would cut another 3000 jobs and reduce its intermediates by 72%, thereby triggering a new restructuring programme to solve business-threatening complexity.
The job losses, which John Fallon, said, are most likely to be concentrated at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced that the third cost reduction programme would cut costs by another GBP 300 million (U.S. USD 394 million) to try to revitalize a business that has been driven by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell its share last month in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectations of the year had not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was reported in the first half of the year of GBP 2.05 billion.

Convoying in Kabul: a NATO soldier was killed in suicide
According to the officials, in Kabul, the suicide bomber attacked military troops, killed one NATO soldier, and wounded several others.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unquoted local reports, three civilians were killed in an incident in the Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence in Afghanistan that took place this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed by Herat Mosheerynus.
On Monday, the suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that the Thursday night explosion took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-made explosive".
According to the statement, everyone is in a stable state and is treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the Correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) are a growing force in Qarabagh, a serious source of concern for the forces in NATO Bagram.
According to UN data, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, approximately 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at Kabul mainly in the Shiides division by at least 30 people.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed in the heart of a major bombing - it has resulted in the most deaths in the military attack in the country since the US-led troops rejected the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights an uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States is considering whether to increase the number of US troops in the country and the police.
According to the Correspondents, suicides in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA withdrawn the decision to postpone the sussing order
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EAEAA) withdrew the decision to delay the adoption of an Obama-time regulation which obliges States to limit emissions caused by wolves, one day after the 15 States suspensively suspensively appealed to the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision to continue "with the 2015 ozone level determination" late on Wednesday, saying that it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe that we need to have a dialogue with and listen to our partners in the States," said Scott Pruitt, Head of the EPA.
In June, Pruitt had announced the intention of rejecting ozone levels in order to measure the pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to respond to a stricter air quality standard.
15 mainly the democratic state, together with the Colombian circuit, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of the environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.
But these attempts have created counter-reactions among the Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air "may reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
In Germany, pigs and cattle may have a party, since strong rains threaten the European Union’s second largest crop of wheat, Bloomberg writes.
This year, rainstorms that have lasted for weeks before harvest may mean that fruit intended for the bread industry can only be fed to animals.
"The quality is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffenen's analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double compared to normal, predicted Agravis.
German farmers, as did their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring that was replaced by a hot wave in June.
In July Germany was hit by sawmills, which have continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
Until now, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
In most regions the harvest has not yet begun, the local harvest buyer in Ceravis reported.
"It's a pretty complicated day," said Ceravis' senior dealer from Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency plans for Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of messies, because through large windows, Saimaa's shores reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, the effort of our northern neighbours to create homes that are both harsh and perfect (energy-saving) will begin.
The ability of Finns to use wood as construction and finishing material, furniture and beauty products is also worthy of admiration and respect.
Integrative techniques and smart solutions, you can find both the builder and the (home) designer in the mess halls.
It is evident that black, white and grey shadows, if these additional wooden towers and rooms, can be very pleasant.
Happy ideas can be picked up for another week, because the Mass lasts until August 13.
The supplies and pottery indicate that it is often cooked in the kitchen.
The night opposed today, the Weekend Festival Baltica was drawn down to today, and Martin Garrix gave him everything he could to remember as the last performer.
When Garrix was present, the people were really turned, singing, smuggled, danced in a self-responsive manner.
When Garrix graduated, the common mass was spread from the coast of Pärnu to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer caught in three days.
I'm sure you're on some of them, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible conflict
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at the collision course to meet the most attractive boxing match in the near future up to 66.7 kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were at ESPN's office in Los Angeles in separate rooms, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked on the other end of the corridor to welcome the Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation's consummated champion.
After a unanimous decision by Garcia, the last four times the world champion Adrie Broner over the showtime won the victory, both fighters belong to the scales of the weighting table.
Garcia passed her right arm and said, "How do you do, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects his belts against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a couple of photos were posted, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, stated that the possible contrast between the fighters would be "a perfect measurement".
"I've been an ex-sulg weighter," said Garcia.
"I went up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move down a lightweight.
And he must move up to the light weight [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
Let us offer them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question whether it should be paid to look at it. It is part of his strategy that he wants Lomachenko to de-debrate at the end of this year in the 61.2 kg class in order to make a possible meeting with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 weeks), who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match winner after their little weight training Forum on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be profitable, as fans have wished for this conflict," said Garcia, later that she is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the founders.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said that she thought Lomachenko was a great fighter and might go to see her fight on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was modest when he congratulated Garcia, saying that he thought that he saw the three division champions from Riverside "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted this pick-up."
Garcia said that the goal was to show the strength of the impact and then box.
Both of them confirmed that they felt the tension growing between them for their own gain.
"It's a fight that awaits realization.
No other opposition will bring so much attention and sumina.
I'm more than willing to work for it," says Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is exactly that.
It's gonna be a good fight."
What corners of the world are being moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Office (PPA) issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
When, for example, last year, a temporary residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, this figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot tell us how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be carried out at the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia ten years ago, in recent years this figure will begin to reach close to 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased sharply during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, the year earlier 675.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing most in Estonia - last year, 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great all the time in Estonia, and because of the complex circumstances in the country, it is natural that opportunities for work and learning are sought in the country where the community and many families have already been in front of us," said Kristin Rammus, the pressman of the Ministry of Interior.
Last year and year, the number of Ukrainians who had been granted temporary residence had increased even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although during the last ten years, the most recent fixed residence permits have been issued.
If the Ukrainians come here to work mostly, then Russia's citizens for family migration.
"In considering this historic Russian community, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, Immigrant of the National Defence Academy.
"If you look at where the citizens of Russia who have received Estonian residence permits have moved to live, then after Harjumaa, Ida-Virumaa" he added, and he pointed out that about 40 percent of them were married to the citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens were granted a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the residence permit to extend the number of Russians who wanted to stay decreased.
"The problem is that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for for permanent residence in Estonia", Pope Rammus explained that the interests of Russian citizens against Estonia's residence permit have been rather stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for by foreigners living here for at least three years from the previous year.
Its purpose is to promote the survival of people who have adapted themselves.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires five years, for example.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably been reduced because of the new residence permit.
For example, this type of residence permit was granted last year to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change their jobs, and the Estonian State will no longer be able to push the finger to see if the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became hard popular - still grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerian (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted residence permits for living in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same many Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In 10 years, a country has been surprised to become Nigeria, with its citizens being one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
Nigeria is coming to college here.
Estonian higher schools are still popular, for example, among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of Indians, Bangladesh and Nigerian citizens has risen overwhelmingly thanks to their learning mobility.
They also have a rule that where the community has been established, it will be easier for others", added Rammus.
For ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
When a year you get a residence permit for some 6000 third-country nationals, this is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if you add to the citizens of the European Union, migration remains around one per cent", Maasing commented that in fact the numbers are small.
According to statistics from the Statistical Office, 14 822 people moved to Estonia last year, while 13 792 people left here.
This means that immigration exceeded immigration for another year.
Most of them are Estonian citizens, but they are more among their exiters.
This is why the migration balance of Estonian citizens with 2000 people was negative last year.
Estonians travel between Finland and Estonia in particular.
Mammmu Couture Princess Museum is charming with sats, ticks and cocks.
However, the history of Maria Tammeoru in the northern ages is: old paintings and costumes: "I could dream about the museum for hours and enjoy old-time sleeves and collars.
If you do something with a passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's a pleasure to find out!
Mommu Couture's glamurous world may look like a lifelike world, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine your life is!
I've got a friend who's got a whole sauna full of my created hat customs.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and he doesn't go to the red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and grey dailys.
It was this thought that led to the idea of moving the high school to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who are often unable to make the fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, on the Verus, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashionalles, where the Royal Defole with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, they are often put in a store, trained with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - hollering bravo, rising up, wanting to thank you on your hands.
A large part of the audience had to be renewed, but now they're fans of Mammmu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be inspired!
And I like the feeling that I'm like on a summer tour.
Pärnu had a 50-foot red carpet, full of beautiful clothes all over the street, and it didn't seem like they were coming to an end!
Maria does not recognise the fashionable fact that creation must be presented to a supermodel, she is pleased to bring on ordinary women.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always come with joy.
It's such a nice experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show myself, I've always been behind the stage to give the most hopeless perfectionist to things.
My bad-ass wouldn't allow me to take a slow look at the show.
Maria is the sort of person who wants to fill not only the role of representation, but to be on everything.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collections I perform myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation and I'm not afraid of my work.
It's not just about design, it's about style, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit the day of one temperament woman.
I mean, these hours of work are gonna be huge for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my day of work ends, it's just full of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless chain of luck: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and in turn, compliments.
It's been said many times that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The glorious grueling satsir that Maria made the talent all night has remained for today's Mammmmu Couture signature.
Martin Mürsepp from the U18 boys: the Estonian sub-group tournament was now turned against us.
It's too bad. It's all over the fairy tale.
The first thing we missed was that we couldn't get our desk.
And when there's such a big difference on the table, there's nothing to do", comments Estonia's U18 basketball boy 61:75 below us UK with our only NBA played basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo ajatreener Martin Myürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the strike table and received so many more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it hit.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we could not build up protection.
But in protection, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It hit the feet on the team.
The opposite homework was better done.
Myürsepa estimates that Estonia would have had to make more tactical mistakes to take the attack off.
In the last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents have already had several quick baskets.
Athleticity and intense pressure that was our weapon on a sub-group tour now turned all against us.
We didn't have the strength to fight their aggression today.
The cataract remained calm in Kalevis, Mattias Tass.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the entire team, so far a single strike was found.
It's a shame that you've already met an aggressive opponent.
The cup has always been self-sufficient and played it out today, but it seemed like she was tired - she's been carrying a pretty big load.
But he made some pretty moves that I've seen in practice," added the instructor.
The numbers to be used: in the basket of these basketball balls, the EM tournament threw at less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the age class of U18, EM's B-divisjon basketball tournament in Tallinn is not only for young men, women started to take place in Dublin.
And Estonia's game with Poland, however, is running into the field of anti-registers.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal, and that period remained five 16:16.
In both the first and the second quarter, Estonia threw away 4, 3rd 1 points...
At that time, the Estonians first hit two pieces of the first four throws in two minutes, and then 25 pieces past the game, then one in three, and then another 21 shots down...
Maybe within almost half an hour, 47 shots were caught.
In addition, 2 out of the four free links came.
The loss of balls was a reasonable number at that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a visketabavu 33 and Estonia had 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the day of opening, it has to acknowledge the benefits of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships have come to Tallinn to supplement their stocks
Today NATO's 1st group of mines arrived in Tallinn for the weekend on a scheduled port visit to complement the ship's resources and prepare for the previous exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare to return to the sea and provide crew members with the opportunity for a couple of days’ rest.
After a visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and to be ready for future historic explosives search operations.
"The participation of the Estonians in the NATO unit and their cooperative training in local waters is well reflected by our integration with the Allied forces", said Master of the Operation and Planning Division of the Navy Commander Major Arto Reinmaa.
As of 29 June, NATO is headed by Commander Gvido Laudups of the Latvian Marines Unit, who took over the functions of the High Commissioner of the Estonian Navy Officer, Commander Johan-Elias, from Seljamaa.
The flag of the group is assigned to the Latvian Marine Support vessel LVNS Virsait, which is also the leader of the group.
During this semester, the international unit also includes the miner of the Estonian Navy Sakala.
As one of the four groups of ships under NATO Marine Command, NATO's 1st regular mine control group is a capacity unit belonging to the primary high-speed reactors, which may be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
4th - 13th August, ancient ruins of Pirita monastery will once again become a place where 13 years ago maestro Erik Klas is considered to be the ruin of the Birgitta Festival.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be the artistic leader of Tallinn Philharmonicism, Risto Josti (36), said to be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world are included in "Traviata" and "Tosca", the ballistic missiles from the enchanting "Boleros" to play the fun "Karlsson", and neither does the plan lack its own production, which is this time the stage of Joseph Haydn's wondn's wondners by the same international creative team who in 2015 brought Pirita on stage Haydn's second masterpiece "Lomo".
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre launches.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival that the snow takes out of power and never let go of it again.
Because the experience that a listener can experience in this superior and mysterious environment makes the human soul ring and affects human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the first year of Birgitta Festival artistic leader.
Didn't the shoes of the maestro's Erik Klas seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Erik Klas, it's been a lot of help.
He led me through my entire student career and also supported my career at the beginning.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to carry on with his work.
The different Klas has injected the Birgitta Festival team with so much goodness and, of course, it will carry it all to me.
It was great to join a team who knew how exactly things were going.
Just as the great heart of Erik Klas gave me the strength to move forward with Birgitta Festival in the Philharmonic region of Tallinn.
And here I am, and I can handle it!
What can you do for the audience at the festival you're offering today?
We have the first ballet from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the presentation will be presented, by the way, written to Astrid Lindgren's account.
It's called "Karlsson Flying".
And one of the chaotic nuances about the fact that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Yuris Karlsons, who expressed his wish to write this work himself.
Apparently, he's had Karlsson's character in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how do you keep up with all this?
Well, thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend as much on other people as I am, perhaps, on how I'm going to meet every new day.
And keeping this informed tone, keeping positive and actually smiling at myself in the morning's mirror significantly increased my lucky percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have been particularly hard to practice and it works.
The smile on yourself activates the brain and lifts the tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people don't even know half the things about their body that the universe offers them, but everybody's gonna find it.
Now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before you step into the conductor's remote?
It is, we need to change our clothes for more comfortable.
This is a little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or make a little nap before the big show.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before they're on the radar.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover for not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Look at the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of Swedish age assessment tests published
In Sweden, the most recent test results indicate that more than 80 percent of the tested subjects were considered older than 18, but not all were convinced of the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing at the beginning of this year.
The tests were designed to assess age more accurately during the application for acyl after criticism by the Swedish Migration Authority (Migraationsverket) for the fact that they have failed to correct the age of a number of alleged minors.
By now, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Justice has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was assessed as 18 years old or older and 25 further cases assessed by the Institute of Juvenile Medicine that "may be 18 years old or older" to be tested.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "presumably younger than 18".
The test shall only be used if the age of the person is under a question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, the results of the Institute of Medicine are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to previous months' statistics, the numbers are pretty consistent," he said to The Local newspaper.
The fact that much of the cases were considered older than 18, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued the results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases, "there are indications that the person being investigated is 18 years old or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagblade studied the results of these 581 tests, it was found that in 243 cases, man had directly claimed that he would become 18.
This medical age assessment method, which makes X-rays and knee joints from the wisdom teeth, followed by the testing of dentists and radioologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose task includes an assessment of human biological maturity in order to determine whether they went through puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for certain, then we shouldn't make a face that we can," he told Metro on the newspaper.
But Johan Göransson, in the defense of the Institute of Justice, protected the accuracy of the tests: "It can be said that the child’s imprecise risk of disunity is low.
The greatest risk, perhaps at about 10%, is when a person is a little below 18."

The 20-year-old hammer-offer, Anna Maria Orel, made London's M.M.M.M.I.'s beautiful debut, getting 67.37 a good 18th place.
Orel was one of the youngest women's hammers, and his joyful wife confirmed that she was hoping to fight for medals in the future.
The fight went well and I got a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80) I immediately made my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much, and the third (67.37) I could keep my head clear", said Orel after the contest.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm so glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended in a good 18th place.
It didn't interfere with the stormy Orel because he's training through the T.T.A. stadium in winter.
"I've been scratched," he said with a little moose.
The Olympic Stadium in London had almost a full house, or did Orel sense people around him or could turn himself off?
I get it, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds - that's it!
If you race yourself, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that she was going to stay at peace with the MM debut, and she's still waiting for a lot of good competitions: "I came here with the 32nd result of the season of this year, or I ended up at 18.
It's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and I'm MMl - that's the only thing that matters.
I'm taking on a good experience, and some days I want to compete for the medals.
Governor of West Virginia reporting party change
On Thursday nights, Governor of Western Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced with President Trump that he would exchange parties.
"I like it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought hard... today I say to you, to the West Virginias, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
Congregation resulted in joy.
"It'll make me a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the meeting of West Virginia.
Trump won the Western Virginia 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate for democracy Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and that he owns a coal mine from his father.
His value is approximately $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (CNC) announced on Thursday night that "the exchange of the Governor Justice party is another blow to the democratic parties, which would rather prevent the country from being better than working for it".
"From the 15 governors and control the lowest number of states across history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of the parties that are led to the end and cannot find a positive and connecting message," said RNC's lead Ronna McDaniel's statement to CBS News.
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are many injured.
The Urmet at the Weekend medical tent told the evening page that they had to share quite a lot of patches.
Crops and marches are basic, out of the bends and slight falls.
Of course, the pains in the head, back and foot.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and so the problems come.
The medics have also had to help visitors with a few more injuries - some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also done seams when a person has broken his hand or finger.
We're doing smaller seams here, we're going to go to the hospital.

Coe congratulated the Russians for their sincere apology for the doping scandal.
According to his words, 'Russia's Thursday honest excuse for doping scandal,' Sebastian Coe once again said that it is not time to allow the country to return to sport.
The Russian light-power noseman Dmitry Sharphtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup that his country had the right competition ban and that he had a strong goal of fighting doping.
He apologized to "all the light-powerers who have been taken away by gold medals and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving a ban on competition established in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," said the president of the IAAF to the journalist Coe.
"The Healthy Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian alliance itself also acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and they will do everything possible to restructure the alliance."
Coe also said that he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the Group's proposal that now is not the time for Russia to withdraw," Coe said.
"We must do everything possible in the next couple of months to normalize the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian light-power players who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the world championships of light-power teams starting in London on Friday.
On Monday, Rune Andersen, Head of the IAEA Working Group, said that Russia does not yet meet a number of restoration criteria.
After a report to the IAEA Council, he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and the refused trainers still operate freely.
The revolution of electric cars changes the demand for metals significantly.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not least that the revolution of electric cars changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining agents like Glencore can say that in one place they win and lose, smaller mining companies will not help.
Glencore is currently serving coal and oil, but in the future there is a growing demand for copper, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel in electric cars.
This year, the UK, France and the Norwegian governments have contributed to the proliferation of electric cars, which will allow fossil fuel sales to be banned in the next decade.
Volvo has already known that they intend to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring down a model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast that more electric cars are already being sold for two decades than cars using oil fuels.
"For some metals, it changes everything," said Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cave and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
Electric cars have about three times as many coppers as normal cars, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at charging stations, so Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about 5 percent by 2025.
The increase in battery demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the increasing trend of electric cars from the increase in copper prices and from being the world's largest cowboy producer, forecasting by Jefferias Group.
According to this broker company, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market responds to a changing trend.
This year 70 percent of London’s metal exchange’s caves have become more expensive.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
The copper has also increased by 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s share rose by 20 percent in London, with a rise in price above the rival of Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
Losers have lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of the lead is batteries supplied by cars with petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium ion accumulators.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for any other purpose that could overcome the fall in demand", said Michael Widmer, the analyst of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch metal market.
The impact of the emerging trend on the price movement is not yet noticeable.
The lead is 17 percent more expensive this year, which is the best metal in London among the main industrial metals in price increases.
Investors will have problems for metal only a long way in the future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive," said Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
If lead demand falls, it will take place slowly.
It may happen in about ten years.
By then, however, tougher emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, dependent on lead-based batteries in frequent engines, will be assessed by the International Lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as the lighter car can drive off with less electricity.
This explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand by 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the total world production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to get worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has become 13 per cent more expensive this year, as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful car gardens.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist the aluminium museum.
"Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet said.
There are some successes in Europe.
The end of the natural age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Last year about half of this metal diesel-powered car catalyst took place, reported the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"A lot of high demand raw materials such as oil and plate may not have high demand in the future," said European raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Platina producers believe that continued demand for diesel hybrid cars will be maintained.
Marc Grynberg, director of Uncore, said that in 2025, more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full electric cars.
In the 10 years' time, the great hope for platinum producers has been developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, based on hydrogen-based cars, which are dependent on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, until now, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Disel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars", said the Exane BNP Paribas from Brunet.
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July, as Stuttgart’s court prohibited the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled consumption of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving world-class from the Spanish football club in Barcelona to the Paris-Saint Germain club in France.
Any consequences for UEFA, a management body that has a European game and has the power to ban the team from participating in the Prestiž League of Masters tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA’s fair game financial rules (FFPs) established in 2011 mean that PSG must at any time demonstrate that Neymar’s transition was financed without massive losses.
Barcelona was paid €22 million (262 million) exclusively for the purchase of Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of the move to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly have the means to recruit Neymar and add such money to its starry lineup, given that the team is financed by the family of the Katar energy infringer.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out in a football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platin after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that would succeed in searching for large debts would actually be involved in cheating and risk ruin if banks or owners had to give up their support.
As of 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of debt.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first in 2003 in Chelsea's - buy a club with potential potential and then make major costs to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period, which lasts until 2018, clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the disgraced rejection of Platinum by the presidential office in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, UEFA, is still committed to preventing excessive consumption.
"The FFP is certainly not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said The Associated Pressile Andrea Traverso, who is a supervisor of the FFP in UEFA.
Although PSG paid for Neymar’s acquisition clause as a single comprehensive payment, they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes into parts for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract and it is therefore possible to show the transitional fee in the next five years as a sum of EUR 44,4 million.
As regards the first wave of FFP sanctions, in 2014 PSG and Abu Dhabi received the toughest penalties on the neck of Manchester City.
A fine of EUR 60 million (i.e. $82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the team of the Master League to 21 players instead of the usual 25 in the season 2014-2015.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to plan for regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through companies related to the owners of the club.
Although the Katar company may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsor is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the support of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG had been raised.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar’s PSG’s service can come from Katar, through the payments of the 2022 World Cup Management Committee.
However, PSG and Catar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a world champion and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties imposed on PSG earlier mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempts to ignore rules.
The people who are familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA did not prejudge the transition with PSG Neymar.
They talked to The Associated Press on condition that they are guaranteed anonymity because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in 2015-2016 at a turnover of around EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsoring transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent in terms of the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, clearly upset by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to stop Neymar from moving, claiming that PSG would be in breach of FFP.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas of Spain, AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Katari.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnet, shares La Liga's position that the state finances the club.
"This is the consequence of property rights and has completely changed the football landscape over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, since the state may have other ways or other interests in order to represent such a large player."

Today 50 years ago: the storm of hurricane size in Estonia, which ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane mentioned for the storm of the century, which on 6 and 7 August caused major damage, in particular to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In North Estonia there were more than 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran from a tree to another tree in the garden and touched his hand to support them.
Everything was dark and gloomy, like the end of the world.
Back in 2002, the old prophet Linda Kurova Haapsalu reminded of the Estonian Nature interview.
Linda's husband saw her garden collapse.
But what do you do support trees with your hands where you can resist such a storm?
The sea came down the window, from the windows to the water in," said Mrs. Linda, who lived on the streets of Kalda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown 20 or 30 meters away, Linda saw only the next morning, like most of the Hapsalans.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the ground, some completely lying down, some half.
Everyone looked very depressing, a storm went through beautiful old trees like a war.
In August 1967, West Virumaa did not suffer very hard compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was still high there, wrote the Official Journal of Virumaa in 2007.
The Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped out on the ground, but the parks in our area were suffering heavily.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at a speed of not more than 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
In Tallinn, on the night of August 6, a little girl had shouted: "Mom, Mom!
Chickens are in the air and can no longer be down!", wrote the Virumaa Journal.
During the storm, the Põll Manor building, situated on the land of cereals, was destroyed so much that it was decided to be destroyed later.
Augustistorm did not withstand the constructions of Tür’s ski jumper, which was not later restored.
On 12 August 1967, the Red Star wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from the fallen trees and their branches would progress slowly, and the inhabitants could be involved in cleaning.
The storm also suffered from crop fields, and the newspaper reported that "partisal organisations must have incentives and directions for both cleaning and harvesting".
Orcans can be told if the average wind speed exceeds 32,7 m/s.
The record of pure wind in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at a speed of 48 m/s.
The wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of the sound bathing areas: night cleaning work and poor beach weather
Colder summer worlds also mean a smaller dry cleaner in Tallinn’s bathing areas.
"If there is no weather, then there are people on the beach, and if not, there are no people," states the beach cleaner.
The wells are competing on the shores of the North-Tallinna Stroma.
They are offered a melodic competition in a low-voltage tractor, which is smuggled down on the strips.
In fact, the last seven centimetres pass through the sand, collecting out of it the sea crack and the rice left behind by humans: bottle caps, cigarettes and others.
People are still coming to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, then there are people on the beach, and if not, there are no people," says Alexander Usov, the head of the Habersti Administration beach cleaning works.
It's 6:30 a.m. and there's a bitter cleaning work on the beach, because at eight o'clock, the plate must be fine for people.
Usov is already on duty at 4:00.
In addition to Strom, he will keep an eye on the shores of Pirita, Lake Harku, Lake Kakumäe and Pikakara of Paljasare.
The quantities of garbage have been reduced.
Years ago, there was a lot more.
People are already able to appreciate what they're doing for them," says Usov, who's been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before that, when something new got up, it was broken the next day.
They're keeping what's on the beach now.
Price of the clean beach
One of the biggest works on the Estonian shores is the cleaning of sea garbage, or adru, on the shores of the shore.
For example, on Pirita beach, 400 000 tons must be taken off for the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," says Usov.
Another large category is home waste, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large landfill containers on the beach strip of Strom, which are required to be empty three times a week.
There's so much garbage going on.
However, colder summer worlds have meant that garbage is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is made up of abandoned items.
Most of these are children's lives.
As a crop of this kind, Usov’s sand has been tearing out a dozen model cars.
They'll wait for the owners on the beach.
"It's supposed to come out more, but it's a normal crop." Usov already knows that soon he'll find them again inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Disperse waste
The Haabersti administrative service representative Erika Scholer admits that the screening work of the tractor is disrupting local people.
The noise that lasts from night hours to morning is confusing the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
But it's impossible in the day.
In one month, the beach has to pass twice.
"If we don't do this, the part of town will fine us," says Scholer.
However, like Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the goal is to get the beach of Strom under the international blue tree quality mark.
"In comparison to Europe there is much more work in Estonia to be maintained by the beaches," says Scholer.
We've got more adru and stones and harder to suture sand.
But there is less garbage on our shores than elsewhere in Europe.
Speaking of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroom, is forced to enter the discussion circle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current narrow spots of the beach.
There's a gross picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is birds and bottle repairers that've pulled garbage bags in the open," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their practices before then, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage cans and put on covers, for example, to prevent at least birds from renovating there.
In general, however, Martin is happy with the development of the Sea of Strom.
It's obvious the city's taking care of it.
It has become more pleasant with children's fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads.
It was once the only way to drive on roller shocks," notes Martin.
Aarticular findings in Stroma: coins, only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri has come to use the morning sword period, who is combing the beach with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he'll find anything precious in the future, either tonight or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough to do so.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable yet," says Dmitri.
Hobiaardecyn is some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that will later throw into the garbage bag.
Usually there are coins.
"There are no rings, no rings, no more such thing," says the treasurer.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0,25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates remain at the level of the former, as inefficiencies of economic growth and inflation reduction have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain calm, as household-restricted incomes have put interest rates on expectations.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MMC) policy makers voted in favour of maintaining the 6:2 rates at 0,25%, and the fewer members will require an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut the growth forecast for 2017 at 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain close, as inflation was still expected to increase by 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also indicated that the increase in interest rates would be necessary to control the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that financial markets could require a higher than expected increase in loan costs.
A year ago, the members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the Mammut package that was launched as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will end its fixed-term financing scheme, which will provide banks with cheap financing, although it has now said that it is expected that it will now be around £15 billion more of a bid, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision-making process, the Bank states: 'the mid-MPC forecast will remain in place in the near future of gross domestic product (GDP), as the real income situation of households will continue to have an impact on consumption.'
As regards definitions, it was repeated that a "financing policy for some effort" is necessary in order to mitigate inflation, and that in terms of "more" than expected on the markets.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps are degree and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and for the following year are comparable to the May forecast of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for 1.8 per cent increase in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the pound’s price fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell to 0.5% 1.11 US dollars and 0.4% 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have reduced growing expectations about the increase in GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3%, although at the end of the year it will slow down slightly.
The latest inflation report by the Bank gave little reason to welcome the rising inflation and the families affected by the unforgivable wage increase, saying that the situation will be a little worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income from being hit in the next few years, but a marked recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak nail also stimulates the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision will come one year after you set a rate of 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the nail.
According to the bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully absorb prices and the economy.
Before the final decision of the bank, it was felt that there was an increasing demand for increasing the rate, as inflation had increased pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers required an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank's message was predictable, and the next few months are waiting to rise again.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2-percent target was entirely due to a weak woman.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to become more and more competitive again, as lenders want work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are beginning to be completed, since refinancing, often free of charge and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is a medicine for HIV that makes 10 000 people out of conflict.
From September, patients will have access to the preventive treatment of "transformative" HIV after a battle at the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that public health is now expected to make available to 10,000 people prior to exposure prevention (PrEP) tablets during the initial three-year clinical trial, which are given prior to the intermediate period, and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by approximately 86%.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Board of Appeal supported the Supreme Court’s decision of last year, according to which NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority’s own claims that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, Managing Director of NHS England, welcomed this operation announced on Thursday as a "new extensive intervention", while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as "inverse moments".
In London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, sexual health clinics are among the first to register people. In October there will be further clinics before the programme will be implemented in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a fever of HIV medicines that is taken before the interim in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials indicate that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PRESS before the interim procedure means that there are enough medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken on a daily basis or at the latest two hours before the interval.
The eligible candidates include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated.
The clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those whose HIV-infected partner cannot receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million and the NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PRESS by collecting clinical evidence on whom the medicine is intended and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new widespread intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of mankind's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted for those who need it and who belong to a group of risks, offers an opportunity to change England’s HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and is independent of negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins' fund, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly delayed by the country and that no members of the HIV risk group are excluded.
Now that PraEP has been acquired from a clinical trial, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
People's Foreign Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the clinical trial of PreEP is very welcome and very late after months' delay and the government's leg-running.
Evidence shows how much changes this medicine can lead to an end to the prevention of HIV and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will lead us to a step closer to fully understanding the advantages of the PrEP.
It is now important that a clinical trial be carried over to the country as soon as possible in order to protect people who are exposed to HIV and bring us closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, but in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the difference between the next day exchange price for electricity fell to EUR 1.94 between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania compared to EUR 7.71 this June, Elering announced.
The main reason for this difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Sweden community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity was EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent from a megawatt-hour to EUR 36.27.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price of Nord Pool was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven per cent, respectively.
75 percent of the previous month's hours moved between Estonia and Finland and 16 percent of the hours in Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between two countries did not have the next day’s transactions.
The electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 percent from Estonia to Latvia, while 73 percent of the hours were using all transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the last day of trade in July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the exchange price for electricity may be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per megawatt-hour in August.
The price of carbon dioxide having an effect on the electricity production price rose last month and transactions took place at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Higher living - half-floor and smart designers have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Hugh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate promoter, exchanged his large Knightsbridge home in 2014 against Earls Court apartment.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
Before that, I lived with my former partner at Knightsbridge on a much bigger surface," says Joanne.
"I have found something equivalent to the price I offer.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment, and it had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer on the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-meter apartment has gone through a complete innovation course.
At first, it was a bedroom and complex apartment - a bedroom - that had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hill from the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The law was not high enough to add two rooms on each other, so it was a architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan was supposed to approach it creatively.
"The metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms, so they would be on each other without having to bend.
It wasn't just building a platform, it was using a steel structure to get the height of both the upper and the lower space right."
This regulation enabled Erfan to create a room other than two rooms of full height with a large amount of dramatic elements.
The old-fashioned copper is opened from the window of Retrouvius to the glamorous living room below the window.
The golden furniture with reflective surfaces, silver details and retro-reflecting Serge Mouille lights highlight the space style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
The mirrors on each end of the short corridor are attached to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with the mirror looks like a window opening in the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet provides a safe place for all Joanne’s tableware and glassware.
To the living room, the charm adds the opportunity to close the kitchen part if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
There's nothing new about the convening kitchens.
But the unique thing about this kitchen is that it's the garage type with the lifting door.
"There was a bit of a design option," explains Erfan, with steel strength, on the door.
"This one has a counterweight, which is why it slides very easily when it's pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is what you sell -- or what gives real estate value," says Erfan.
"The real estate broker enters an obsolete format room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"The materials are what you touch and which thereby help to create an emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart sound."
It shows that a good design and an increased area can help make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they can create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The lead character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyrocketing bounty hunter who competes with my colleague for promotion.
No matter how much money you earn, next to which you forget all kinds of ethics.
A man sees his wife and three children just early in the morning and late in the night.
In the first half of the film, she thinks it's a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerald Butler's speech manager are similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the frame-housed element remains, and the moralizing intention of the film-makers is becoming more and more visible.
A life-changing experience will provide the main character with a son's disease.
Now we have to choose between work and family life.
A son who is dreaming of the Architectural Department puts his father on foot to the big buildings in Chicago to think about things that are really important, such as faith, goodness, love... that are not even a disaster of two vectors.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, he feels that the moviemakers have set the goal of crying, for even the most harsh-hearted viewer cannot hold back tears when he sees the suffering of the dear cancer boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, his father finally understands the immorality of his work and does good works to an old man seeking work.
Now I'll bet on myself - if the film has a happy ending, I'll present my transparency after the film's coffee, but if I'm wrong, the scener can praise at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm out of coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital, and the man storms down the hall toward the room.
However, the son is miraculously healed, and even though his father has lost his job, this will prove positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of America's drama!
The truth of honor is a film well designed, all the elements needed for it exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important in life.
I'm sure this movie's gonna bring it in good.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually handle it.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Head of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, hoping to keep the boss smoother in water.
Here's a broken reporter from Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Head of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with high officials on his first working day, he highlighted the key problem with President Donald Trump in the White House, which he was planning to solve bad information to the president's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if good information were to be shared with him."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to track Trump's media use.
President Trump's relationship with television goes beyond decades, and now that he's in the White House, his TV habits haven't been lost.
"If the candidate Trump was angry about the unfair media coverage, he was worth showing that he was recognised in the affected publications as well," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February at Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "Six previous campaign staff said that the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a stable set of runways".
All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter usage habits have never been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's sparks would have been even more cooperative without their intervention.
We're probably never gonna know about the set Trump didn't post.
If his assistants were able to save him a few times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating a thing.
Some of the problem is that people in the White House of competing clicks try to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their world prospects, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico, who reflects the whole story, wrote about the tendency of advisors to feed the President on strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Pragues and former Trump submit that Trump may react to a negative press, especially harmful information sheets, explosively, by being obsessed with the discovery of their source.
This was the case at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of Charles C. Johnson's article on the website GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source of missing information".
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of abuse, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he's made false accusations in the past and took them back.
Trump read the article and began asking subjects about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of the White House Office Rob Porter "was trying to establish a system for the management and documentation of documents coming to Trump".
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll turn Priebus into a more effective leader, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still fighting for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from outside the capital don't get permission to perform bitters.
There are many foreign residents in the city centre.
Those with whom the newspaper was told admitted to play in the Old Town without permission from the city government.
First we found three street musicians near the Viru Gates who had taken as many dogs as possible.
It was clearly seen that musicians with rastacks and loose clothes were backgoers who would use a shower to get their hands on.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company had a fun rhythm story, while a man next to her was juggled with three balls and called the passers closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on one of their backpacks and smoking his heart rate himself a screw-up.
Their three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who used to play the Aoriion with Noem and the balls, told me they were playing music on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company was to collect ticket money on a vessel travelling to Finland the same day.
The question is, did they ask the city for permission to kiss in the old town, shake Noem and Bob's head?
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most of the time, we're allowed for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for this," said Bob.
When we got back to the Viru Gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and they were driving them away.
The Society moved to the Viru Centre with their backpacks and dogs to seek happiness.
There were also three half of the young men on the Viru street, one of whom played violin, the other being a clarinet, and the third had brought in an electronic piano.
"We are here to give people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living", explains the Trio of the piano in Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city government's permission to perform must be granted.
"We don't have it, naturally," he said by joking.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go somewhere else, but try," he added.
In July, the Bank of Estonia purchased debt securities for EUR 149 million in the framework of the public sector asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks, and the central bank bond portfolio increased to EUR 4,36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the Eurosystem central banks’ asset purchase plan covers three different purchase programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The effects of the acquisitions will result in lower-risk assets being produced and will motivate investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, in the context of a public bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its government bonds, and no other country bonds are purchased.
As the Republic of Estonia has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
The replacement purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, the Bank of Estonia generally buys debt certificates from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank buys bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s debts were also acquired, but as of June 2016, Eesti Pank will no longer purchase Elering’s debts.
In the name of the euro area central banks, both Elering and Eesti Energy bonds are purchased by the Finnish Central Bank from June.
Travelers ignore ditches and return to "millionaires"
Some of the richest owners of the West Midlands have returned to a fierce conflict with determined migrants who have ignored the currents dug by the council in order to win back the outside of their wools.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailers outside the wealthy "millionaires Division" near Solihull Street.
They have returned with the armies of horses, children and trucks after they were thrown out of there in May without being disturbed by a ditch dug by the Council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the barrier, squeezed its vehicles through the unprevented section of the footway.
The Maruvia residents have been hatched by the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "unprofitable in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after they got out of Bentley Heath, where they created passers with stones.
The Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they drove away, and now they're back.
They were coming up last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long warrants to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook's way, and I'm not happy that I have to continue to pay the council fee if the council can't even stop that kind of thing."
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "That's ridiculous. We only saw how the last of these migrants left, and there is already a new attack.
This time the number has grown and even the horse has been observed in the grassland."
The representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that the country near Streetsbrook is an unacceptable camp site, and we are working with the Solihull police. We will put in place the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
The collection of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
Weekend Festival will also be visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar among others, who is pleased that the real world's top names have been managed to bring Estonia.
The question why Weekend festival is so important for Estonians is that the island answers that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the festival three days in full.
However, he acknowledges that the real players of their territory have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this is often not happening in our neighborhood," says the Minister of Culture.
What, though, are some of the most prominent artists in the festival?
I think of myself as a relatively old man, and for people like me, there must be one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren, who stood up last night.
Well, according to his record, we've all been running around on our own at some point," he says.
But he'll bring out a number of names, like Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players are also: starting with NOřP, and they can be read in a whole series.
In fact, this concentration of known names is very high," he says.
Look longer from the Watch Tower video!
The audit updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles that hit car manufacturers in the middle of the crisis
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the President of the BMW, the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than restrictions on travel", referring to European cities, including BMW’s home town of Munich, which has considered banning or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will update three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these activities as being called back.
European car manufacturers have actively advertised the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide extracted from diesel engines is considered to be a canerrogen and may cause asthma.
Also, the cost of equipment for the neutralising of emissions from diesel vehicles for the automotive industry is increasing, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
At the same time as German car manufacturers are under investigation, the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of ignoring the signs of a ludicrous and a problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s errors, which silenced the use of so-called fraud devices, which allowed to adjust the emission levels during car testing to comply with the regulations, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others have been investigated both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month the former head of the thermodynamics sub-unit was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from issuing and may go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in criminal investigations about Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audio of installing the system to circumvent the European emission levels by extending the investigation that had been focused on the United States of America earlier.
The inclusion of the audit in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen by the manufacturer of luxury cars generates a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen’s profits.
Estonian schools receive €20,000 tickets from the European Union.
By 1 September, the Ministry of Education intends to purchase the European Union's flag for the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres will be awarded to 570 educational institutions of the European Union flag.
The flags are intended to be exhibited in indoors, they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment with an tunnel extension, and the ERR newsportal is transmitted by the ERR.
The flagboard label contains the text: "The invitation to Estonian schools for the first Presidency of the Council of the Estonian European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 tickets is 20 000 euros at the cost of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
The death of a journalist highlights an increasing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce staff usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and illegal drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They say it's important to change your routine.
Two senior writers discuss which seems to be safer: whether to bring the children to the office, which was the target of the grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the top of the room, "the enemies", "neutral", "the allies".
They ask reporters to give their names in each column, to provide no evidence, enough impressions and internal feelings.
Being hired by government or cartels suspects drug dealers, politicians, business men, and journalists a whole list of bad guys who are dangerous to reflect chaos in Mexico.
There is no outbreak of violence, and the more dead bodies colliding across the country, the majority of them, according to the Journalists' Committee for the Protection of Journalists, have been killed by at least seven journalists in seven states since the appointment of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012.
The latter include their editor and source of inspiration, the co-author of Riodoce in Javier Valdez Cardena.
"The worst mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote about one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be perceived everywhere in the Riodoce building of the fassaad hangs a big picture of the average finger displayed by Valdez with the letter "Current" and two in the 30s of reporters Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-star with his ridiculous glasses or a panama hat characteristic to him.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reports discuss joint trauma, his nightmares, insomnia, paranoid.
Although a separate public prosecutor was created to deal with journalists' cases in 2010, only two cases have been subject to judicial responsibility as reported by the Committee for the Protection of Journals.
As for most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which reach thousands, journalists' killers rarely reach justice.
Riodoce continues to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the killers, Ibarra said that a meeting on security is of great benefit.
"It's too stupid to waste time at this meeting," he says.
"Until the reason is known, you're gonna be distrusting everyone."
Valdez left Riodoce's office in Culiacan, State Capital, on 15 May.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped him in the red Toyota Corola, forced to leave the car, and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "twelfth of the river".
The man who was armed drove away in Valdez's car and was in an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, the Valdez issue is primarily restricted to silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the release to the United States of America in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, because the clinics are fighting for the execution of the power vacuum.
No matter how many people are shot or even more in the streets of Sinaloa each day, or that the cemetery is full of the numerously decorated, double-dwelling mausoleums that are bigger than many living homes.
Let us just forget that the peace period refers to the fact that only one cartel is being run by valuable ports and drug routes to the United States of America.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks involved in his work, Riodoce is fully aware of Ismail Bojorquez (60)'s enormous guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to killing.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, who was competing with the sons of Guzman and a cartel at war.
All copies of this publication were purchased by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived in the newspaper brochures.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the branch took place in another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always exist.
In 2003, he worked at the Noroeste newspaper as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50 dollar units.
Bojorquez said that Sinalos "was impossible to deal with the press without having to deal with the drug problem."
The newspaper gathered in time its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish powerful research without fear of censorship and the readers in a lumma print that they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, the newspaper won its Latin American reflected Prestižse Maria Moors Cabotti Prize.
In the same year, the Valdez Journal Protection Committee (AKK) won the International Prize for Freedom of Journalism for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said by accepting an AKK prize.
Last October he told Rompevito TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task of playing stupid with the press agency is another chance.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths, or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
Riodoce's collective misses Valdez, a joker who roped like a madrus, a friend who kindly shared embuss and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the street from the office to the El Guyabo bar and always sat on the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love got him fatal.
His death has also caused them to question how to best do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like the bouts of their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
Even in the best times, the result is strong self - control and self - control.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said there's a problem with the fact that "the smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros and other states that are home to the toxic composition of productive smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is changing all the time.
The body where Riodoce staff met for security training was suddenly no longer allowed mobile phones; some days before it was discovered that only the spyware sold to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for a tad of 40 degrees of heat in the shadow of the tree.
They were appointed by the government to guard the Riodoce office, located in the four-storey building in the Culiacan middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters wondered, ‘ Are these policemen among the 50 percent police officers whose governor himself has mistrusted? ’
Many months have passed since the reporters have traveled to mountainous places where controls are in the hands of de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce this week's edition covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an revealing story about spending government money on governor's hometown.
And one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a group of people were abducted, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time for caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows is a place of interest for drug dealers as well as authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant has been registered in the name of a politician who belonged to the institution in power (ILP), which dominated all political levels almost throughout the past century.
In recent times, several IRP governors have been accused of a wide range of cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the same place, including the way in which the son of El Chapo's son was released from military forces.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for Valdez’s column to get information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"The least we could have known was what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose cleenlike design has served him a nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a safe deposit room for signs and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the unsolicited workers have received something they could never expect activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and headed to the local prosecutor's office next morning for a second press release.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the West state of Michigan.
According to the found dead body and officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and are critical of the organised protests on pedestrians and buildings in the phrase "SOS press".
On that day, President Bojorquez will be away in Washington, trying to collect international support in Valdez's case for setting a fair foot.
The day after Valdez's death, when he met with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of persevering journalists and killing them for speaking the truth.
He then asked that he be directed away from the government’s activities elsewhere, worrying that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "limited" by organised crime, co-sponsors and any society.
In his last book "Narko-journalism" he wrote that reporters not only kill drug gangs, but also do so under the command of politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime.
In the last year, more than half of journalists' attacks on police and public officials were attributed by the Media Channel Monitoring Group, Article 19.
"In the bee, you die because you're wanted to be silenced," said Ramirez.
Murders obviously affect bloodthirsty.
No one forgets the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias's death in Tamaulipas in the northern border state six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that was probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta, "I'm here for my reporting."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to his undressed head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in Chihuahua, the northern border State of Chihuahua, after killing Miroslava Breach, their correspondent in March.
Others keep moving on as they did in the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after their manager's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartel in public on the front cover "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have escaped from home states or even from the country.
It's a rodent's decision.
It's hard to find work in Oxil, and they still have to hide the streets in order to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are pursued, as probably happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in 2015 in one of Mexico's apartments three months after the escape from Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a poet, admits that reflecting a drug business scares him.
"Methiko's on his way to hell, and that's why I started reporting," he said.
At the middle of a recent Friday, when the freshest number was already locked, Riodoce editors sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and were drinking beer when all the phones suddenly started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Maztlan, 19 people were killed by confirmed data during the fire exchange between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to interfere, as several cartels found in the region promised.
On the same side of the sidewalk, reporters put news on the mobile phone using Riodoce's website.
The day before day after day needed to be changed.
The sirens went through another exchange of fires in the area.
Bojorquez was looking for the police to see if they were on guard.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't show it much less.
Under the massive portrait of the founder of the newspaper, on which his average finger is visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's workers were able to track him down.
"How can we even think about closing down," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, asked an intern to send him to the streets to report to the streets?"
Dinosaur used protection to prevent enemies
At first sight, it looks like a shape, even though it's pretty scary.
Scientists have now announced the first findings of the Canadian miner with the incredible size of the nasals, which has so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered in its intestines was red-brown color and his past had been somewhat "hardy".
In the journal Current Biology published a report on the nature as "all the better preserved solo dimusdinosaur that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaur inputs worldwide".
Fossil is a new species of nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the crisis age 110-112 million years ago.
This incredibly good survival was hit by scientists who describe it as "really significant".
This kind of herbalist covered in salts is best preserved by the National Geographic journal of this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn't remind me of the surrounding stone, and he decided to look into it more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, the animal was developed to dig out of 1,500 pounds (1100 kg) of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be brought to the public.
"If a bit of eyebrow, you can almost believe that he sleeps," said the leading author Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrelli Museum where the creature is exhibited.
"It's going to go to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs-- the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
When investigating his skin, scientists found that this planter, although covered with salts and resembles a walking tank, was likely to be seriously threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
It used red and white protective colors to hide from predators, and applied shade techniques called resistance and also used by many animals today.
According to experts, it allowed dinosaurs to better blend around and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs likely kept him in the hunt.
This 110 million-year-old nodosaur family creature came to the news for the first time in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now examined the creature and named it Borealopela Markmitchell Museum laboratory Mark Mitchell, a member of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazing survival of the individual, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the intestine on the animal's body.
They discovered an antidote — a method of protection in an animal country, meaning that the upper part of being was darker than the lower half.
Although the resistance has spread, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelle is far greater than animals living today with resistance.
It suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other dinosaurs in the muscle that evolution preferred to hide instead of the opposite position as a survival act.
However, most animals that use modern - day resistance - such as deer, zebras, or armadillis - are much smaller and more vulnerable in the harvest, suggesting that nodosaurus had to work really hard to survive.
"The intense hunting of a dinosaur with a large and large volume of salts shows how dangerous animals from dinosaurs in the crisis could have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of salts also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to get clues about this life, including the preserved contents of its gut, to find out what the animal ate in his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into a dying river, thereby reaching a flowing sea where his back fell to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to go much further inland as they are now.
"This nodosaurus is really significant, as it is fully covered with preserved gender-like skin, while it has remained three dimensions, keeping the animal's original shape," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost like the time of the crisis.
To reconstruct it, you don't have to use a lot of imagination. It's just that it's just a tear in your eyes and it seems like she's sleeping."
The time was when the great two-legged dinosaurs — teropods — moving from muscle toe on the earth.
Although all of them, King Tyrrannosaurus rex lived millions years later than Borealopolta, this heated dinosaur could be chased by some of his frightening predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopleta sacrificed after death in the sea and it mumifated in the mud.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk discovered that he mined the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved soloist in the world, including skin and armor, and it is a complete convex up to the hip.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighing up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two ora broke out of that shoulder, 20 inches [20 inch].
Scientists believe that this plant eater covered in salts was going through the current Western Canada until the flooded river was threatened by its open sea.
But the burial site of the dinosaur at sea helped to preserve its desires perfectly in detail.
The stoned remains of this particular individual are so well preserved that the skulls of the mygarical solo plates along the dinosaur continue to cover the skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "This degree of durability is as rare as the lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Lung skin remains covered by the mygarical scales on the skull of the animal.
The right front leg rests next to him, and five toes are straight up.
I've got a chance to count on the solos on her plate."
How did one activist find the answer to "Who's Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
Just the day after the trip to New York, it was sitting in a bed rented by Airbnb, a resident of St. Louis on the phone to Facebook.
She got into the post of her former schoolmate.
It says, "He just killed a 18-year-old and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information on his stream, so he closed his Facebook and opened his Twitter.
The longer @TheePharoah user's posts were repeatedly shared in his timeline.
In real time, a rapper from the area of St. Louis transmitted Michael Brown, an armed 18-year-old black-haired young man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouris.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later on, he saw a light again the other night, which reported this time of human gathering on Canfield Drive.
They took photos of police birds and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a note "The Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!".
He watched a real-time stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another police officer, he said, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he got himself thinking, "That's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to, and we could call typical."
I felt a nightmare at that point.
I was angry and cried."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, he went to his father's house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive in the next morning alone with Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "Whose Streets?" (the "Kelle Streets"), which will take place in the cinema on 11 August.
This is the story of survival and protest, love and defeat, strength and strength of people who live in this community and who met the streets in demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter had a flower dress on their back and had an appropriate crown on her head, they renegotiated on a subject that they had discussed before this morning - about black experiences and living conditions.
"Do you remember when I taught you how to fight for the rights of the black community?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed the 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"What's going on right now is... what's going on in the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organisation and, at the same time, to feel different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not experience personally-frozen racism, he does not differ from another black - skined daughter.
I feel like I'd make him a bear if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when Ferguson arrived was on the way to South Florissant, a place on the way from the police station, which had received a certain kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was never finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who prepared lunch food.
They put the bags together and helped to share them with the protesters.
For Ferrell, the new type of activity began to slowly take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he said, stating that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was the President of the Association of Sisters and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It all just worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met a film director Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to document what was happening.
Ferrell came up with a question, "Are you trying to document what happened or find a story that can be used?"
Such skepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white people - come to the community and try to reap its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in his recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already beaten hands with co-director Damon Davis, a region artist known for activism in connection with sentenced prisoners.
His involvement changed the project for Ferrell and the other six locals who were watched by the crew after Brown shot for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak ourselves," Davis said.
"For me, it was important how these people were pictured, because that's how they picture me."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - he could show that the movement was not the "leading leader, but the meeting of the community", as said Folayan, he was the most open-minded part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt as if I were naked," Ferrell said, laughing the first time he saw a tape shop ready.
"But I realized that certain vulnerability must be accompanied by this work and the humanisation of black people."
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story emphasizes and again focuses on the role of a black-skin homosexual woman in the wider movement of Black Lives Matter.
Two of the three beginners who thought of social media after the killing of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in 2012 out of the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter, is homosexual.
"Ferrell said, "and that's precisely because we have to fight on several fronts constantly.
Black-sexed homosexual women must carry all this burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that "movement really keeps black women alive, and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he claims that "it is not a matter of creating equal opportunities" - Ferrell was not chosen to be the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was a man who blew the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was right on the front line because living at these nodes is much at stake as a black-skin homosexual woman.
His energy can be sensed through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long since disappeared, but racial connections between the community and the police are still fragile.
The penalty imposed on Ferrell at the time of the demonstration for blockage of the road shall last for a further 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the area he calls home, just "shumbohu".
Nevertheless, he still considers the mantra he had eaten from the Memorial since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 times after Weekend's party over from the North.
Some of the tougher men's boys will find after a lots of fun parties to help out of it, too.
Or they're just saying, "outside hell, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a proper health effort.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow’s Weekend tralli — or any other party — and to get over the pagan as painful as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol under and after, after a big party in the morning ... or, if possible, even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses much liquid while drinking alcohol, it has to somehow be recovered.
With water, mineral substances are also washed out of the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritable after smoking, it is particularly good if it is not bubble-free or only slightly gasded.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure you wouldn't pay the hanger to break up trees with your grandmother - that could be a fatal lie.
But a light walk helps the body to remember how it feels to be alive again.
Landing in the tent and getting the hangover is a more time - consuming way to heal.
Give your body back energy slowly and carefully.
If you're already out of your mind last night, you're sure you don't want to try to load a big fat steak in your stomach.
Start with fresh juice, for example, where fruit sugars are placed quietly on your body.
If the health of the south is already suffering, you might want to try, for example, a broth.
And back a little later.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretics will release your body from the last water.
As has already been said, the water and the juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller in order to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will also have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose performance.
So you're gonna ruin your liver even more, and in the future, it's gonna be worse than the North.
In addition, the painkiller will not last for long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach - it'll irritate you already in a dirty stomach.
Or if you don't take a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It works about the same way walking, but walking can't get an orgasm.
However, exercise at a moderate time should be avoided by excessive active paces and bogeys.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk stupid with friends and fellows, make simple fools, and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others.
A joke and a laugh may not be a joke, but I'm sure it'll be more fun to put up with them.
One time, it's going over the hangover anyway!
The professor of Northwestern and the staff of Oxford University are wanted for murder as suspects.
According to the police, the professor of Northwestern University and the staff of Oxford University are searched for suspects after finding a male body of men with fatal stab wounds in one of Chicago's luxury apartments.
According to Cook County judicial documents, arrest warrants of 42 years old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday for the murder of the first degree due to their alleged connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, a 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabling.
According to the warning that the Chicago Police Department had issued to the community, the body was discovered on July 27th.
The cops got a phone call and found a victim on arrival at Grand Plaza's apartment room with several tox screens on his body.
According to the officials, at the Cornell-Duranleau scene, dead and investigators are involved in the stabilization as a murder while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co- professor of microbiological and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of Public Relations at the University, said in an e-mail message that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and he is forbidden to enter the Northwestern City.
"It is now a matter of criminal investigation by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern cooperates with investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is an elder in the University of Oxford's financial department.
In his e-mail statement, the representative of the University of Somerville College said: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist U.S. research agencies in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give himself up.
The head of the Chicago Police Department of Communications, Anthony Guglialid, strongly recommends that suspects give themselves up to the authorities.
"There is an idea where they are, but we are dealing with the definition of the exact location more and more intensively," Guglim said.
According to Guglieli, suspects can be sought by local, regional and national authorities.
The guglidelist said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager, who had just received a cryptic hint that there was something going on in apartment 1008.
According to the police description, it was a magical sight.
It is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said the security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren staying in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," added Guglimelmi.
Grand Plaza's management sent a letter to the population: "The police are currently working on the identification of chronology and victim backgrounds, and explores various motives, including the possibility that it was a family member."
Identifying companies that help your company avoid becoming Uber
Amy Renett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her e-commerce start-up company, but the polls were useless.
The answers were often vague, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he allowed to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Adret, who manages an e-commerce company selling hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees, Madison Reed.
So he called for help from outside.
New types of human resources are being dealt with by start-ups that help companies find out what their employees know.
By launching and licensing the software, which is designed to measure employee involvement, they will allow companies to conduct sudden interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line to file complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to go along with C-level leaders and turn directly to the management board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitzbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitz for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, the co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analysts use companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Eretti, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel during the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to sudden surveys and interviews with specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company, giving an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they must remain familiar with their work culture so that they do not become the next Uber, which has been stuck in scandals since the former employee published a blog mailing that described an aggravating environment in which they were punished for those who dared to speak.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than USD 118.7 billion according to Let's Talk Payments data from the Financial Technology Statistics website by 2020.
Denver Colorado’s start-up company Converter, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed an interest and an increase in activity in Uber’s suspicious reputation this year.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.

Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send custom pulse polls, collect confidential answers in real time and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous communication link that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints will go straight to the board.
"The official opinion has been given by the regulatory authorities," said the founder and CEO of the Convercent, Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan stated that if it is found that the company treats its employees badly or behaves in an unfair manner, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, workers' departure and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations, has been used by Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees' awareness of the rules and operations and to provide an easy way to communicate with the headquarters of the corporation.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find a corporate headquarters’s telephone number or e-mail address, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a despicable and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday's general advisor James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, there are potential problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not earlier reach the leaders who acted in offices in other cities or states, to identify and deal with them faster.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360 degrees experience of staff," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from disputes with employees."
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, or after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media got mature" understood companies that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being washed online.
"before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
both Glint and Converter offer their software as a service, taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent financed $10 million by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, increasing the value of the capital raised by it to 47 million dollars.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing from the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments will not come as a surprise if they take into account the link between enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More research has always shown that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets, such as silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely contributions on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Department for General Benefits and Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If the third-party analytical tools allow an increase in employee commitment and involvement, then no wonder they will find support.
The acquisition of data on employee involvement is important, according to the professional culture experts.
But these data are useless if the company monitors do nothing with them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that there will be changes ahead.
And if the changes do not take place quickly or at all, it can lead to disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4000 proposals, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how businesses make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Cause if things don't end, the workers think, "Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Eretti, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly surveys among its employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed workers in decision-making speed and quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
However, new data on workers are collected in Ruby Tuesda, and it is hoped that in the long term it will lead to longer-term commitment for workers in the industry, known for their high labour flow.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, then you lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The bright star of the euro area is Baltic: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes in the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic output per person has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
There is a low debt burden behind success, a rapid improvement in institutions and a business and free market-friendly policy.
"Balt countries with Slovakia are among the few euro area countries, where real GDP per person is significantly closer to the EU average", the central bank said.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total economic output per capita is equal to the richest Western Europe, in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per person was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement process.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek a better salary abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the inhabitants of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was slightly less than half of the surveyed economies in their countries.
The NCAA decision to cancel twice a day training sessions will make Bruins days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when the tropical UCLA football team stops for discussion at the edge of the new exercise field in the campus of the crew.
Some of them have peeled their backs off, revealing the first day of their training camp's efforts on the sweaty back.
For a large part of the team, these forces offer a midday break.
The players taking part in the summer courses will head back to the joint establishment to study for the final exams after 3 hours before returning to Wasserman Football Centre for the next morning at 6.30 a.m.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," said Bruins Coach Jim Mora a little before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the players' efforts to reduce the load twice a day, in fact, has longer their days - at least until the final exams reach one side on Friday.
For this reason, the UCLA's first three workouts were scheduled to begin at 19.15 p.m. to fit players in a close schedule anyway.
The transition from two trainings a day means more days with more than one workout - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season and for the first time during the six Westwood season, trainings take place during summer courses.
They have up to 20 August scheduled 18 sessions before the formal preparations for the opening game in September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of NCAA's rule change, although this adds another item to the players' close charts.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break through this trial; they will make an effort, they will be great young ones.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really nice."
Once the camp has finished, UCLA’s trainings will be closed, which is not an easy task at all, given the clear view of their fields near the parking lot and the adjacent Luskin center, from the upper class hotel, which has already been hit by footballs that have been able to access the gate mail’s protective net.
From this weekend, the hotel's Bruins players are engaged, but Mora admitted that problems could arise during the free rooms season.
"Let's have security," said Mora.
"It is a real place of concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a record of your training, it can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we'll use the security team at the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place."
In return for revenge on the Saviaare-Ivanova Election Union, the Reformed Kristiina Ojuland and the EKRE to leave the Reform Party, which was created by our Tallinn and the Party Party to show at least as much as the parties involved in the local elections this year.
The chicks are considered, however, in the autumn, and the key question will be whether all of them are sufficiently disappointed by the voters.
Who's staying with Savi Island?
Once the support community of Edgar Savisaare has fallen small, events organised in honor of her electoral union can be avoided.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present midwayers and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And is there a reason why some of the Savo Islands' loyal followers and friends in Tallinn avoid running out of the campaign, looking for a "Savisaar List" by corrupt and suspected corruption crimes to become a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the municipality to the Russian populaulu, where the older part of the city of Lasnamäe is involved; and, in any sense, the original computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the sounds of the 16 and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to go to the polls for the first time?
We wait for the idea of a youthful election campaign for other political parties.
If the viewers of Kanal 2 or TV3 are looking at the black square from the beginning of August, they will have two options: agree that in the future, only the ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels will be seen in free circulation or will be sold every month to some of the teleoperators.
There are probably also those who, at the outset, are publicly happy with television experience, but in the end, even though they are reluctantly paying for television images and advertising.
There are almost unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you do not want to be part of the noise yourself, however, you should go home instead of being pained - and leave the place to sleep for the rest of the festival.
Washington changes the rules on the green card
Media publications quote President Donald Trump, who said that a new U.S. immigration plan was planned to change the rules on the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to Congress to discuss it in two chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money because it changes the way green cards are issued to citizens of other US countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy," said Trump, according to American media publications.
Young people of the Siberian Seto move the city, pensioners move back to the country.
Anatoly, Jevsejevi continues the tradition of gold miners on the ancient coast of the Mana River.
He works 140 kilometers from home as the driver of the Earth's additional River Image at the gold satellite.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without holidays for 12 hours and then only ten days at home and then again.
In three years worked at Artel, Anatoli has seen gold only once.
"There's a tough time: when you go in, you check that you don't bring the wine, and when you go out and you don't take the gold," Anatoli says.
Mare Piho has spoken to the local Seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The still preserved archaeological culture of Siberian sediments will also affect home-sets, as it is just so fascinating, considers the most far-reaching sediments studied by the Piho Mare.
His first study trip to Siberia will last 30 years this year.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many sets did still travel to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century to get the land here?
It's an insoluble question.
I claim 8000.
I calculated it according to Siberian Seto's men's stories, who's been thinking about it for a while.
It's just hard to say, because up to 30 people could come in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was only given to one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was many times bigger than the historic Setomaa.
It had to be trained, managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they came into regions that were not only linked to agriculture, but also to the river (wheating), gold mines, industry.
For example, in Newpetseri, many sets went to work later in the secret city of Krasnojarsk-45 (in the form of a Soviet power to build a uranium survey - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sediments then form a majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of getting married and having a lot of children lasted for a long time.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How many cultures of Siberian Seto were different and different from those of the motherland Seto?
They're different, even though what was brought here was never the same.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did themselves themselves (the crowds), but they always made the difference that was brought with them and what was done here.
Climate change strongly affected the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it is colder here.
Food changes.
In Setomaal, for example, it was salted, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian Seto and what life is living there? / graph: Alari Paluots
The link with the motherland was spiritually strong; it was considered very important.
I think it's starting to give it back to Setumaa, it's starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have been listening to amazing stories.
The pilot is referring to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to the Kingdom Day of the Haitian village early in July and lived four days in their homes - J. P.
What's left of it is amazing.
"It's very easy to come and go away, because the city has a great place to live: a railway pass and a crossroads," says Reigo Tamm, from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sport and culture and a pizza at every angle.
It's a top-up town!
There's a small island on the side of the White River that runs through the city, where the killers tend to have a jaani party.
"This beautiful spot of the train window doesn't look like," Reigo says.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
On the river’s water, you can have a picnic and just make a romance - you can see the river running and think ahead and back of life.
I've been walking there with my girlfriends.
The Operaisian Tamm has gone on the rivershore, three bridges practice his own ariads: "This place is at the edge of the city, no one may resist when their stories are reverenced."
"A wonderful view of Tapa will be opened from the mine, but there are also health barriers where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, play a discgolf - the golf course has been made, chains can be rented from the sports center," Reigo will lead.
Well, old professionals go there with their disks, of course, but I haven't been there yet.
I think my colleague Rasmus Kull will have to invite him to visit the meeting, because he has experienced discgolfier and he has disks.
She's lending me!
Reigo and Männiki Hill were part of the age of childhood of today’s operaism.
At least during oral hours.
There's a lot of tears left on this hill, disappointments, and you'll win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken leaves and mouths.
"The entire city is now filled with construction works, all this becomes unknown," Reigo accepts.
Kill the old and tired blindhouse, however, is a very attractive place to play for souvenirs.
I am glad that in 2012 the leader of R.A.A.A.Märt Meos accepted my idea and had to make a blind summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksi Karenen was over, on 11 August, there is a railway station "Elution" when the old blind house moves around in the 1980s.
"By August 11-13th, the days of the town of Tapa are the days under which open home cafés have been awakened, and cultural events, including folk race, are held", Reigo says, who recommends visiting the town of 91 years of age just in those days.
In the small yellow cottage on the 1st of May, the museum has been from 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very much and the information is enormous", recognizes Reigo's location, full of the history of the Kill City, most of which focuses on railway and military.
Reigo says that if you go through all the recommended places, the stomach will be empty, but luckily, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good restaurants and sometimes feel like you're abroad" he describes.
The trained and young soldiers who have come to the meeting spend a lot of time in pubs, since it is a strange feeling sitting there that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
On TV, bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally tented people on Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but now there's an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already putting in place harsh fines for all those who are caught by a resting place that is not intended to do so.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppies teach wolves to break sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers will have to give the wolves "training material" from their her her herd again after a break - probably the wolves taught by puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
The wolves in the county of Hiiu have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep, and eight have been injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year there were only three, one year earlier, 124.
There is also environmental agency data on the fractures that the Hiiumaa wolf nests were not born last year and the Hiiumaa hunting council's information that this year there are two wolf nests fixed on the island.
On Monday night, wolves broke 15 sheep in Kabuna village and injured 18 surviving sheep.
In the morning of Wednesday, wolves broke one sheep in the herd of Reheselja village and seriously injured one of you who had to be killed.
The rules for the treatment of genetically modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Life sent a draft law on the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and amending the plant protection law to the coordination circle.
The amendment to the Act will give up the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, which will continue to be used as a plant health register.
In addition, GM’s crop operator will change its obligation to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius.
Although genetically modified crops are not being grown in Estonia at the moment, we consider that clear rules are needed to combine genetically modified and non-modified crops.
At least until Estonia has decided not to declare GMO-free", said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Earth.
"The same must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account both private and public expenditure and administrative burden", added Suu.
The draft legislation repeals provisions relating to the collection and training of premises and operators of GM crops in GMOVS, sets out requirements for the management of GM crops and for starting up economic activities.
In particular, as regards beekeeping, GM replaces the current obligation of the farmer to inform bees of the start of GM cultivation with the obligation to reach an agreement appropriate to be concluded with the bee before growing.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to consult the information system on the drafts and to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if they wish to do so.
The proposed changes affect persons, bees and the agricultural administration in particular in the field of crop cultivation.
In the European Union, including Estonia, there is only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
However, until now, no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reason is the fact that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European carnivore for which MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of maize line are also developed for the southern regions and are not suitable for our climate conditions in May.
In 2015 and 2016 the Ministry of Earthlife has commissioned studies to detect possible GM pollutants in the seeds of various summer pigs, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and that the study concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruits Nemanja Maticu in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of a "genius" after the middle field player against Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
A 40 million pounds over Chelsea, in the last season before Uefa Super Cupi Real Madrid, in the last game in Dublin, a 2-1 victory in an initial battle against Madrid, impressed by the defence role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to walk freely on the counters.
However, after leaving Blues’ pre-season tour of Asia, Maticul remained desperately in need of a match form, and he only lasted 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, it must be fixed before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mood," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him reach the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly started setting up his eleven-start man by the start of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wanted to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club had already done "great work" by entering into contracts with three of its four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three of the four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can do four of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another son of a gut got to the foot of the GSM transmitter on August 1st and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a familiar bird observer living in the desert, the first son of a bitch had received the Sõrves equipped with a transmitter, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the large overnight collection of Mullutu-Surlah.
This is because the Sparrow is not a crop field, says the voice of the Islands.
On this Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the cucumbers, another son of a bitch and this one on the island of Muhu.
Martinson said that installing transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a sad boy named Mati GSM was supplied with the Sõrves Tukul.
"His activities on the Internet are all watching: how he went to winter in Spain, came back to the German and Polish border for a while, and then came to Sarah," Martinson said.
The British explorer had a microchip put in his body to get into the house and in the car with a handbar.
The British explorer became the first person in a country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could just open his front door by hand, get into the office and even run the car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had to install a tiny chip between his thumb and a nominal ring and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has united forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant in the Royal Hospital of Hampshire Hants in Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure to be installed.
Northam's company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to match the chip by asking for a lock of 300 pounds.
This married father of one child has installed the technology now both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost the taxpayers thousands
According to the military documents published by TIME, the decision of the White House to fly a Navy helicopter last month for an event of American production, to the south of the yard, was to pay almost $24,000 to the taxpayers.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One on board the President, was the central feature of the event introducing American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House renewed industrial products on their tour from all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin and a tow truck manufactured in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the eskatar Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House military cabin required the presence of the helicopter, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter's 'unusual' landing at the southern court.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event," said the HMX-1 commander's day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, deputy Marine Controller in the field of aviation.
It was noted that the helicopter would arrive on the south side of the yard at 7 a.m. on the morning of July 17 at 3 p.m. and remain there until the yard was cleared between 18 and 21.
It was added that if leaving the White House there should be a return flight, there would be another occupation due to working time limitations.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the escalator security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to determine whether or not the other emigrate was finally needed.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event might be in breach of this provision.
"We asked if it would violate Hatchi's law, and we were told not to violate," said the commander.
"It seems you don't have a choice," answered the deputy officer.
The White House announced the event for an official event in America and the Hatchi Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political alliances.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform that had been discussed at the Senate at that time and welcomed efforts to maintain government regulations.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for a politically profitable purpose is no new phenomenon.
Presses must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a clean photo session is unusual.
Trump got distracted in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, turned into a president's plane, and his Twitter account bursts from messages that complain about the use of his predecessor's president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the presentation of "prepared in America", where the products were represented from all the 50 states that have been manufactured by American workers from materials in America," said the White House press editor, Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 teams are often trying around Washington and on the south side of the yard to train the United States President of the White House to take down a centimetre.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 in the White House yard organised 58 sampling trips.
According to the official, the flight to the "America" flight crew was considered to be the standard of flight for that month.
In addition to that day, the shuttle helicopters flew for 11 hours for "non-responsible support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exponents of this event loaded the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of the extraction of the helicopter south of the yard.
HMX-1 does not keep the President's budget documents and the precise costs of the event difficult to identify.
However, according to the hourly prices of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24 380 per flight hour.
The operator's documentation indicated the flight length from the ground base of the Navy from Quantico airport in Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is far below its sum.
"The calculation of the cost of the paying agent based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, care and other non-reversible costs to be taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, although they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former White House pressman Sean Spicer protected the use of helicopters at that time at the event.
"The idea is to show the things made this week in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are expected hundreds if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been working on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it."
It's not clear whether Trump was exposed to a helicopter in the south-east of the event, or not, but he was sitting behind the fire-fighting wheel.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to representatives by making fun of company products on media publications in his own aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears arrived peace and joy
In 2011, MMil Daegus hit Šadeiko in the last area, 800 m ran by foot and was taken away from the stadium by a stretcher.
Just before that, he had gotten zero in the distance jump of the universe held in China.
Helsingin EM in 2012 was injured by a low-wage injury, but on the debutary in London he received 6013 points at 23nd place.
However, bad luck continued.
After the opening day of 2013 Moscow MMil received a thumb injury at the Estonian record schedule.
Two years later, he received a 15th place in Beijing, and he met the Olympic standard, but even more so he wanted to disappoint the athlete.
The most difficult cadalip only passed Shadeiko last year, unless, at the beginning, Amsterdam, EM had a long-distance jump result.
I'd just like to put together a decent multi-stakeholder competition, either once or once.
Once, Shadeiko confessed.
The worst was before: one month later, his Olympic competition in Rio broke out on the first pull.
Time to take it off - do you want to go on with the seven competitions?
Is the effort of two days worth all that?
She thought long, but she found peace in herself.
I thought I'd clean my head.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and to think straight.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pill in the bag yet," said Shadek of my self-cleaning.
I got a clean sheet to turn and move on again.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the caretaker’s suffering, but she realized that, above all, the athlete himself needed to be clear.
He was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he deserves," says the mountain.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He'll be happy to do it.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set up a new Estonian record 6280 points at Götzis' multi-game.
At a high-level competition, he improved his personal peak brand by about a meter (13.89) and ran in the record-time barrier.
Then the multi-stakeholder felt that it wasn't the ceiling of abilities, but that it was just a first-time dream of competition.
The mountain that has been guiding him for years says that Šadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a sportsman. He's good at training.
If there's anything wrong or there's something wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his consciousness.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
The new approach has also been found in Šadeiko.
"I am not the one doing the maximum in practice," he says and says that the most important thing is getting the right consciousness, because it also ensures a good result.
A close baby's happiness makes me happy
Happy emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by loved ones.
Both his former training partner, Maris Mägi and Sister Grete, recently became parents, and the multi-stakeholder has received support from new foreigners.
"It's been interesting," says Šadeiko.
One alcohol that you drink is equal to "trenitus" in your brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes - with wine, he can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" process of taste for wine.
By smelling glass, circling wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and knowing the taste of it, we put our brains on the job to create a taste for wine.
Sheperd said that wine molecules don't really contain taste, but taste is the way wine stimulates the brain.
He's bringing in a comparison of how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in the wine, the taste creates the wine to taste," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of spit that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, insists that wine is not full of drink.
"There must be more to it," he says.
If you're taking too much fun, the system's overheating.
Too much wine drinking can harm the brain rather than harm the brain - according to the 2004 survey, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance, and reduced mental ability.
10% of Estonian ICT employees get less pay from colleagues
Fontes data reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are less paid by colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writing about the portal in Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontese ICT pay survey.
A total of 8 577 posts were observed.
63% of the posts were employed by men.
"While only 3 companies noted that the pay gap is in favour of men and that the remaining companies consider that there is no wage difference, in reality, the basic wage of men's month is 10% higher on average and the total salary of men's year is 8% higher than that of women", said Fontese analyst Ilmar Põhala.
"Narcos" 3rd season promotional clip: now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Netflix will enter the central position of Cali cartel
Despite the fact that Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed in the second season of "Narcos", Netflix's island is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the flow transfer service, and the first of them has already been made a promotional clip, which is destabilising the series with the new bad guys.
In the third season, the DEA will pay attention to the richest drug trade organization in the world - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful Crusades, like Fortune 500 companies, simply with more bribes for the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) in its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) manages connections with Mexico and Chester Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released commercial clip, Pedro Pascali looks back to Javier Penana as a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement aid in war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will be open on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
On Wednesday, the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are elected vice presidents, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The emphasis on the importance of women's role cannot be exaggerated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully involved and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has threatened on its part the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
The elections of this year will mark for the first time when power will be handed over peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1,2 million women have been registered from 3.6 million voters.
The joy of sharing makes every thing worse for both big and small.

From the Philippines to the heart of the world, or the Olgkot’s trip to the Moefanns
In the last few years, the flower bags are a summer classic, which has become a self-registered product, which, in spite of its modest origin, is to hang on to the hands of one of the right souvenirs, and which has been used by traders to boil up a hit label.
A bag of straws is probably one of those things that have existed every time and whose possession has not produced any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it isn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags have exchanged their fine design bags for summer months to make a real race and moefäns against the simple straw bags.
This is not only a beach bag, but it is as popular as a street bag today, and more brave women even walk into the office.
However, it should be made clear before it can be made clear whether such a summer log is still sitting on the top or whether it is worth pushing the lawn and the laptop to a slightly more formal summan.
But in the middle of a change, the straw bags have made women a real love for summer.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to do is to keep an eye on the house market for the first time on holiday, and to buy yourself a shoulder bag, to which the whole rest period is loyal, and which goes along the beach, the market and also the girlfriends on the city in the tails.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a bigger pile of bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that there is so much demand among readers that women (and men) in the real world should come at each other on their hands to become the happy owner of some of their homes.
In some respects, this madness is also understandable, because few are these times when a thing that has risen into a fashion world can be bought for only a few euros.
True, clever traders have also discovered a simple option to raise money, and so are the smaller luxury brands selling beer bags for a while and for thousands of euros.
Probably just in order for richer customers not to feel like ordinarys who promote around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana for over a thousand euro-payers.
However, Chanel’s straw bag interpretation can be found in a circle of 6000 euros.
Unlike most of the fashionables, the shoulder bags were not derived from some great fashions, but rather from the story.
It is said that shoulder bags come from a far distance from the Philippines, where they have spread without them.
The weighing of a larvae bag is mainly an exporier and local ones are very often not seen walking around with them.
It is said that the 14th century century was the result of shoulder-enrichment techniques and is quite sara with the usual earring.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to weigh as hard as a basket, it can be used by patterns and other materials that make the bag more personalized and more attractive.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags with red shirts or leather strips in them.
But thanks may be sent to actress Jane Birkin, who had not been seen before.
That's exactly how he adapted the shoulder bag to all kinds of clothing and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
With the popularity of bags today, however, care for them is not a smaller one, but also that care for them is a cockhead and, unlike all other Sudaneses, they do not need to be maintained by special means, but the matter also takes care of water and wet towel.
As always in the case of trend attacks, since the classic appearance, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can get yourself a chestnut or a tiny shoulder cap.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag will never go from fashion to shoulder.
But what's a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of such straws, which resembles its style of basket, has been considered classic, open and short, as well as straws, snails.

A home with a golden touch in a millions of nights in Tammerna
A woman is building a home - instead of a funk house, a light wooden house
The missing man was found three days ago in the island.
On Wednesday evening, Aare left her home in Kärla, an unknown direction.
Aare was on the phone last night, Friday night, and the phone positioning gave him the location of the West-Saare municipality, the village of Mõnnut, where he was searched with a helicopter until midnight and with dogs until early morning.
Then his phone battery was empty and his location was therefore no longer possible to determine.
Police continued their search this morning.
The police thank everyone who contributed to finding Aare.
GMB is concerned about investing in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company expects confirmation from McVitie's leaders of long-term production plans at the firm's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silenced the Tollcross object on the future of the investment.
In a factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, more than 500 people work.
The owner of McVitie's Pladis said that they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the object over the last few years.
That's where the employees and the union presidents were hired to be "the first to hear" if anything changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter sent to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to 'dissolve concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines'.
The GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can't find out from the subject's headmaster about Tollcross's business needs and the future investment plan makes our members very concerned.
Here, several generations of families have worked and workers are largely made up of local communities and people in Glasgow, being more essential to ensure decent employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social weather.
So, from the point of view of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow and Brexit, the rise in living costs and, in view of the chronic decline in production, urgently needs a highly productive company in McVitie."
The Pladisian representative said: "The Tollcross object manager received only yesterday from GMB Scotland and the company responds directly because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago a regular meeting was held in Tollcross between employees and representatives of GMB, where several problems were discussed.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other companies in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are currently reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over GBP 5 million in Tollcross, most of it has gone into production lines and improvement of operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as the object of production, and if any changes are to be made in the operation of the object, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by offering a quantity of GBP 189 million to buy him, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record of conquest?
This gross approach has opened a summer transition window, and Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than double the current world order of oversolding, which was set up last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for GBP 89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will result in the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will be paid over 500 000 pounds a week after the payment from PSG.
Barcelona is well aware of both the approach and the free breaking of Neymar, although the close source to the Board of Catalans confirms that the club has always provided the best care for the football player since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in concluding an agreement with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who were thinking about recruiting some of the best PPG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll meet them and contact their players," said Al-Khelafi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to make a deal with some of our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the line because the Spanish club previously showed an interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratt this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow Italy to leave on any condition and that Barcelona would be able to regain its interest by losing one of its precious assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders after Brexit.
"Brex is seriously threatening to fight between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the United Kingdom and Ireland", warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the free movement of people and goods today, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to the Vice-President, he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union, and since it is not possible, it would be part of the European single market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the departure of Great Britain more smoother would be to establish a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
When it was noted that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have such an agreement with Great Britain".
The alternative would be to return to customs points that would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
"To trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
Märt Open: Ironman can pass everyone through its first half-long triathlon.
In the winter capital, Otepää was held the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltic States, when half-long Ironman’s competition took place from around a thousand triatletes from over thirty countries.
The 70,3 miles long distance consisted of 1,9 km from swimming, 90 km from riding and 21,1 km from riding.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life, too, was completed by Märt Avandi.
"I thought it would be difficult and eventually complicated," said Avandi in the finalis.
Despite the complexity, Avandi acknowledged that in fact Triathlon is a strong head for all.
"Not to kill the distance, but to kill the pace," he said, suggesting that with a successful pace, everyone reaches the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp, "It's all right with a physical man, but he can't swim."
The Avandi had been busy training since February.
Four to five hours a week, and then ten hours a week.
At 05:34:12 he reached 270 points in the general accounts.
Although Avandi lost to the Raio Borders (age 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called “promensist” races.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost to Avandi in seven minutes (age 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18 respectively).
The general winner of the calculation of the Otepää stage men of the Ironman series was crowned John Moldan by 3:58:27; the Estonians were the best with Ivo Great at 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederis won at 04:24:01, while the Estonians, Maria June, who lost nearly half an hour to Frederiks, and received 04:58.
The key went through a 42-minute 42-and 14-second swimming distance of 1.9 km.
He came out of the water at 410.
