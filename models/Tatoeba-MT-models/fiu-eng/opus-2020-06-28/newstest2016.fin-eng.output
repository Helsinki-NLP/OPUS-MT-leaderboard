The 9-year-old boy on leave in Tampere found
Police have had a search mission because of the 9-year-old boy's escape trip to Tampere on Tuesday night.
From West Tampere, with his friend, the missing son report has spread on social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no life- and health hazard.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanom half-night in the knowledge that he was found.
He's fine, and now we're starting a follow-up.
The boy was found in the immediate vicinity of the home. Dad told me.
Ronaldo, again, as a wretched man - tears the difference in paint to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league during the weekend and continued his work on the Master's league.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo on the league of the Masters turned for at least a moment for the latter's benefit.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time goaling statistics when he shot a visitor into the Shahtar Donetsk network with two hits of penalty matches and one of the play situations.
Ronaldo took his goalboard to 80 when, before Tuesday with him, the Barcelona Mess has 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0.
The Juventus has been koshering in the Italian football league at Serie A since the beginning, but in the Master's league D section it began with a 2-to-1 guest victory from Manchester City.
The victory battle was over ten minutes before the end of the Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city stunned the absence of a knee-stamping Sergei Aguero.
The Aguero who was injured in the weekend election game came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
The second group in Manchester also experienced hardship in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2-tapp.
The 20-year-old ManU wingman Luke Shaw's guest match only lasted 15 minutes.
The dangerous-looking slip of Hector Morenon in PSV hit the paint towards an attacked manu pack so badly that Shaw probably broke the leg.
Shaw slept with Eindhoven's home stadium grass for ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to 1-0th minute, but Manu's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno set off before the break at the extra time.
In the second half of the PSV victory scene, Luciano Narsingh made it.
The Landing season in the Master's league began with Paris Saint-Germain.
The case had been changed by Angel Di Maria, Argentina, the PSG-sniff of Manchester United.
Di Maria broke through the right and pulled the ball into the back corner by Malmo's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for the second half of the PSG.
PSG has been pulled into the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's EUR-longer, is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the PSG starger, met for the first time with his professional career’s departure company Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, Moscow TsSKA, lost the B block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a distinction - the president gave the wrong speech
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has re-introduced the same speech he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently realized that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91 years old in full breath.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants were rushing to say that the confusion had taken place exclusively in Mugabe’s leadership and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed the impact of China on the economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional meeting of EU leaders next week as a result of the refugee crisis.
Mr Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, leading up to summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make Europe more effectively registered.
The negotiations on asylum seekers are set out in Merkel's table.
Teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call
Sound is just a little bit of a color university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "gold dog" was alive and probably shocked, as well as that the contact details of a dead woman's closest contact details were found on this phone.
The cops inside the house found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written message on the side of the petition: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel this love for Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," a letter that experts said was signed by Lamp.
No reference was made to the fact that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believed he was shot and killed by a former history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at this office door.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told the university staff about the shooting at 10.18.
He said that Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after.
By the end of the day, the number of the dead rose one more: Lamb committed suicide at the time of the police.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive after the day that the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the school crash.
Researchers on both sides of the state have made public information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, however, who may have had problems.
Students told me that they waited for her hours.
The Prentiss City of Death, Gautier, police say that Lamb had no violent history or record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in the book he wrote, where he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute for Social Science and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised the Lamb, but he said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong".
Another student named Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay principles mean that even though Lamb had worked very hard for his doctorate, he did not give him any automatic career development and assistant professor's position.
William LaForge, Director of University, said that there was no contradiction between the Lamb and Schmidt to know that there was no conflict, but "There was clearly something in the mind of the Lamb".
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb escaped from campus, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississip from Arkansas State.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-calibre pistol in the backyard of one house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, reported D.C.'s death examiner, Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still in the yard.
It wasn't right away why Lamb just went to this house, even though Johnson said he thought he knew people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught country and educational studies. The university has 3 500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb performed a doctoral degree in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met with friends together.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a fun, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charm in those days.
All the girls were melting wax while she was there, now told me Hairston, 40 years old, who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who was living with them at the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentisss, Shawn O'Steen, told me they broke up 15 years ago, but they were friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me she hadn't met Lamb, but she had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail both appeared on the summer market three years ago.
Later they called together in a few gigs.
O'Steen told me her daughter was doing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many different online companies.
According to Mike Shaffer, the barman of the Julep Room, near Gautier, and the timeline director, Mike Shaffer, who saw Lamb and Prentis last night in contrast to September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lips show for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were playing games, throwing blows at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led a first-year student seminar program and was specializing in Indian and migrant history, told the English teacher Don Allan Mitchell of the school.
Schmidt was married, and he had three little kids.
He studied at the Empire State University of Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State campus, a candle charter was held involving approximately 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the tale during which the university choir sang songs from Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland.
The Associated Press writer Emily Wagner Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected by the police saying that the Lamb has now called after the shooting of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not employ as many workers for the rest period as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to make more hours.
According to the company, it plans to employ 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country when 45 000 were employed during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of vacation time, the Christmas purchase season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help in the occupation of shops and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his date with Princess Diana.
Back to the future - the first night of the film Michael J. Fox was an extremely important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also worthy of attention for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said the coming documentary film Back in Time's trailer.
The movie starts and I think I'm just about to be at the end of the tea bar and the hand stretching away from the date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a document about Back to the Future, which was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future got her first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "To me, it's no doubt the most beautiful time travel of all time."
Back in Time is available as order video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The UN Director says that Syria will not be able to resolve the situation armedly
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "will not be resolved armed", and further weapons will only worsen violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference in the middle of the week, Ban said that he was going to meet with the five permanent ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the ministerial meeting later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
The Ban called for five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis as they demonstrated when they agreed on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 out of patience to show that Donald Trump is serious
Some people have tried to make him a windmill.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow down Donald Trump from the point of view, it has not been successful.
From the last 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge in the two-digit century, and some have begun to seriously reflect on what this means for the King of real estate.
Of course, the election is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership over Herman Cain, neither of which was able to recover any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general elections.
However, foreign groups, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and conservative Economics Club for Growth, have noted Trump's perseverance and started to use their resources to pour him down.
The following recent survey results indicate that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trumpi's popular numbers have turned it around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, the statements of support at Monmouth University showed that only two of the ten Republicans welcomed the municipality.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
Last week, 60 percent of the Republicans reported that they welcomed Trump in a survey by the University of Quinn.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be satisfied if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC questionnaire last week 67% of Republicans said that they would either be "satisfied" or "satisfy" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "discreeted" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson makes about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "suffered" vs. Trump 40 per cent).
The next thing you know, it's the most exciting thing to do.
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "satisfying" or "sacred" if Jeb Bush became a candidate for power-makers' favorite Jeb Bush.
The nature of Trump's fire is not a problem for the majority of Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpi has been widely criticised for his massive speeches and insults, according to ABC News/Washington Post, 52% of Republican voters at national level think that the municipality has a suitable quality for the President.
According to a survey on Quinn's market last week, in Iowa, the state of the first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52% of the Republicans think that Trump has an appropriate quality for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Post survey 44% think that his nature is not suitable for president, and nearly six out of ten believe that his character does not belong to the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC questionnaire, four of the ten considered Trump the most likely alternative when asked who is most likely to be the Republican candidate.
At the end of July four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information release: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball in place.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was appointed a candidate, and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any event, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider Trump's campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a sickle field likely promoted Trump’s leadership, as the support against Trump has divided among many other candidates.
However, the survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in the hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points, and Rand Paula, John Kasichi and Chris Christie every 33 points.
He's on the same page with Ted Cruz.
The only winner who won Trump?
If they were set up opposites, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump with a large 18-point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters have just made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump's supporting voters have decided who they will vote for.
Of course, the situation may change, and no one can say for sure that they will never change their minds.
46% reported that they could possibly exchange candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgery Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice more likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say that Trump agrees with immigration.
Since Donald Trump was called Mexican immigrants in his campaign reference speech two months ago, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s power to drive Latin voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published Monday, six out of ten Republicans say that Trump agrees with on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is in the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
The decline in government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their position outside the policy area.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in ABC/Post survey that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bélmberg two weeks ago on Iowa showed that three of the four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "satisfied" and 21% "of the real angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first introduction to Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly expected since his election.
Jeremy Corby, the new leader of the Labour Party, will meet David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby’s first six questions will arise a little after noon, and the media as well as the Labour People’s Party will probably keep an eye on his performance.
Corby has called for this weekly show "less theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to handle.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Centre of Trade Associations on Tuesday.
At the same time, during the national song, the leader of the Labour Party has made the decision to keep quiet in the service of the Tuesday Memorial, organized on the 75th anniversary of the British Civil War, and has been advocating criticism of the representatives of the Conservatives and has been present in several front pages of the case.
Corbyn's decision not to sing national songs has attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said his "respectively quiet" and that he recognises "the bravery of honorary air forces in the British air war."
Mr Owen Smith, member of the Corbyn shadow government, said to the BBC Twon Newsnight that he would have asked the Labour Party leader to sing a national song despite the fact that he thought the King's House should cease.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to take part in Corbyn's internal circuit, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and he was originally supported by less than a sixth of the parliamentary party.
Robin Brant, Secretary of Political Affairs of the BBC, says that the differences in line regarding the position of party in the European Union and the government's support coverage have also been "raised" within the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
At the meeting of the central trade union organisation, Corbyn said that the Labour Party will present an amendment that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, shadow government working and retirement secretary Smith noted that the party was "stamply clear" in that they only oppose government plans to calculate the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn becomes the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has met during the last decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics, and now tells us that he has 'enforced' ideas for questions for the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corby, Member of the Islington North, has said that the nature of Question Time is too opposite and that he intends to refrain from both clever speaking and squeezing, while he promises to concentrate on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's secretary, Angela Eagle, is acting as her substitute for Question Hours when Corby does not participate - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should sometimes be given the floor, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House, Mr Bercowi, on the agenda.
When Cameron got in charge of 2005, he said that he wanted to move further away from a political theatre that is often connected to the Prime Minister’s questionnaires, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since the start of television in 1990, Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator in assessing the leadership's discretion, the control of his lower room, and his position with other representatives of the people, even though critics have criticised questions about the fact that they have become just a gloom that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Uncoded young people are trained as photographers
It's a tough place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is an unprofitable studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and win it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to complete the project.

The value of the tree increases as the UK wage increase accelerates
The value of the weight jumped up after the numbers appeared to rise in the UK wage increase, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer item SABMILLER.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent from the same time last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to be accompanied by an assessment of rising rates.
The pound rose to over one per cent of USD 1.5505, and 0.84 per cent against EUR 1.3330.
The FTSE 100 index closed at an increase of 1.49% to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most separate stock on the market and rose by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry stock rose by 0.9 per cent after encouraging news from the competing luxury group in Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the miner told me that it had raised $2 billion by calculating the shares as part of its debt settlement strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were the largest in the index of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation from the company to the form of "sale".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the company released information about its half-year return before taxes: an increase of 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can harm enlargement
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage of workers is raised in the UK, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, noted Cowgill.
The costs could be directed towards the company’s enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less jobs.
Metcash launches a grass-root campaign against intrusion in the Aldi area
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trading son from the attack on Aldi in South and West Australia.
The wholesale food dealer Metcash has launched a grass-root campaign to defend the market share of IGA dealers in South and West Australia before the Aldin $700 million attack.
Aldi will prepare two distribution centres and the first trade early next year to South and West Australia, with up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build IGA brands through the marketing of mainstream and social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA’s traders and buyers have jumped along, and brands such as the Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo’s offer a sample of IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesale store of food, alcohol and hardware organises the annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the game, since South and West Australia account for almost 30% of the area of Metcash IGA stores, with yield margins higher than the IGA network of the eastern States of Metcash.
Visitors who buy South and West Australia are known to be square-angled, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share in them than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west than in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will catch around 5% of the food markets in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first movement, which will be obtained from all operators, but mainly from independent dealers.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that, next year, Aldi will open up 25 traffic in the south and 30 in the west, which will generate a turnover of 500 and 600 million dollars in these regions.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at the high fixed cost of Metcash can cost Metcash about $113 million in profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the Eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan investigation found that IGA’s clients were the most credible of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018 so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week's managing investment fund manager and founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said that in the business lunch in Melbourne, Metcash could "possibly lose in the decade".
Metcash has refused to reply publicly to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the government of Metcash would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has decreased from 18% to 14%, and its output on the food and food business of Metcash, which transmits products to about 1200 IGA dealers, has decreased 43% since 2012, says about the reduction in debt financing of operations when pressure on sales and margins is on sales.
However, the wholesale seller keeps half of it and has invested over $150 million a year in calculating weekly prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Walworths, helping IGA dealers to repair shops by increasing their fresh food faster, and by introducing a better range of private brands.
Mr Morrice, Director-General of Metcashi, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of sales have increased the attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesale salesman will return to the path of growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union, supports Thanas Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been suffering side by side in the recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgis. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own conduct, says the President of Australia's tennis union Steve Healy.
The younger member of the gifted twin called "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was unwittingly exposed to the case of the Stan Wawrinka Montreal Masters.
Soon after this, in a hot race at Cincinnati, the principal judge had to twice separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison from each other when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat that kid."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking down his mile after the cramp ruined his possible victory from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the untapped defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth in doubles with Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semifinal UK.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi has just been dragged into the waste," Healy said.
He broke his mail when he lost a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail when he gets frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved finely, including quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a fine team around him, has a fine family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
She's very mature for 19 years, she works hard, fits into the team and so on, and she never had any problems with other players. She's been appreciated in the dressing room, she's practicing hard, she's in good condition and she's quite calm and mature young man, and I think she should be judged according to her merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to engage in important games starting from Kygrio on Friday, describing this 'common decision' for everyone as a good solution, but still supporting the Canberraese to return to the team's stability system.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all around [Cyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the publicity to consider these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary announces an emergency situation, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed its anti-S Serbia southern borders by arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of evaporating the flow of migrants coming to the country.
The border followed chaos when hundreds of migrants gathered in a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities responded by stifling.
The people who fled the violence in their home countries have now set up their tents and settled for an indeterminate period between the two-country inspection stations.
However, there was an increase in the loss of productivity.
While keeping the police helicopter above them, the immigrants said "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian mellac police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was "unfortable to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary when they would be arriving more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, no harm to civilians.
The debate must be held in the near future with other countries and Brussels", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The conflict between Hungary and Serbia was created after the 28 national grouping failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibility for the 40 000 asylum seekers, who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they were hopeful that the final agreement would be reached - next month or by the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
On Tuesday next week, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act shortly.
Tuesday's emergency room in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to act in the event of a crisis and to allow you to be closed down and to speed up asylum cases.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that it is ready to help Serbia's border, the country will also set up its border against Romania to stop immigrants from coming across the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and the point of arrival for refugees from the European Union, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and from other parts of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees looking for a better life, and those fleeing the war, who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now define as a crime the company to cross or damage a 4-foot (13-foot) wire fence, built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human dealers.
"As a result of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency situation", informs journalists of Zoltan Kovacs of the government in the south of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: crossing an illegal border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally accept the deployment of the military expected for next week, but the Associated Press journalists at the border have seen, for days, heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
The Orban domestic safety advisor, Gyorgy Bakemi, said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their attempt to cross the border, as well as 15 more countries.
They got over them by harming the fence, are now imprisoned by the police, and are accused of the violations identified in the new laws.
Authorities are quick to fix the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two out of seven crossing points from the border against Serbia after sending a train wagon hidden by a wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary fell into chaos when Hungarians opened up a small office in the metal office for human handling, and the troops got in.
About 20 got in, but thousands stayed out.
A group of immigrants supported the main engines between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the national survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed down on the side
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton will continue in two-digit leadership in the democratic appointment contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders wrote him down.
Clinton now supports 47% of democratic voters (decreased 58%) and the second is supported by 27% of Sanders (rare of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential competition, but he is in favour of 15% of the Democrats.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, the majority of democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters are more stringent behind their choice than other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since the recent CBS News Poll survey, while at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed down.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's headway in the district of democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and now he's on a plane with Sanders.
But Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
In the last month, Clinton led Sanders with the liberals in the double-digit century, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the democratic voters in the country say that they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says that he will support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s present supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
The minds are more confusing for those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only a quarter of him would be eager to support him.
Where 48% of democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the Republican Firstman Donald Trump, says the same thing about the rarest Republican voter (35%).
When Mr Clinton's supporters were asked on an open question, why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%) and the most popular answers were that it is now time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice President has an impact on the possibility of a presidential candidate, 57% of the Democrats would like to see him in the race already - although one third disagrees.
When asking the democratic voters who they would choose to appoint as the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue a democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton's leadership will grow from Sanders. If Biden starts up, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves behind, it will be 30.
55% of democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential elections, but this figure has decreased from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden will stay far away, but the proportion of those who hold her to the vote has increased.
However, when the democratic voters were asked what was most important in the candidate, they raised their views ahead of the voteability.
In the last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Candidates of Democrats or potential candidates will be able to do well on certain key issues among their parties' voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is best off the triangle in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters say that Clinton is not considered honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When we look at all these points, about a quarter of the Democrats say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and the use of a server while he is a foreign minister still raises questions, most of the Democrats are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and says that they did not have an impact on their general opinion on him.
But it's different when we look at America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with his statement, and only about one third is satisfied.
The opinion of the people was soon divided in March after it came to light.
Most Americans say that e-mails did not affect their overall attitude about Clinton, although 36% say that their opinions on him have become worse.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for all registered voters. Only 32% consider him to be honest and reliable, and this figure has been down 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not considered honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of all registered voters in the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion of him, just like neither did Carson.
The error margin for a study involving 351 Democrats is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates gathered half of all the votes in the new questionnaire, leaving others fighting for their feet.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly supporting Trumpi, whose support has increased from 23% of the 23% questionnaire on last month's Fox News election complaint to 27% on Tuesday.
At the same time Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with a wide range of demographic groups and is being set aside for Trump's highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohion Governor John Kasichi.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are on level in the third place at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of this most recent survey carried out in September is +/- 6 per cent by the Republican voter.
The latest survey published last week by CNN/ORC showed Carson being on the rise of surveys: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is 32% above him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was also significantly above Carson.
With Carson's popularity rising last week, Trump criticised the neurosurgery that was retired for nothing, even though Carso apologized for the questioning of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of the death of a student at Baruch College in the first year
Almost two years after the student died in the brotherhood's simulation ceremony in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains area, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
The members of the Baruch College, Pi Delta Psi, in New York City, were brutally attacked by Chu's 'Michael' Deng during the membership challenge in September 2013, and subsequently delayed his being taken to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that the eyes of Deng were tied and his back was loaded with a drop of more than 13 kg full of sand, after which he was repeatedly folded to the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field toward the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that he was going to get hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but the charges say that they waited an hour until they brought him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the network for information on his symptoms, and contact Brotherhood's National Chairman Andy Mengi, asking for advice on this matter, Commissioner Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"This is where the members began to hide their ritual gear and, in practice, put the brotherhood's welfare ahead of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
They didn't get Deng to take a nap, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had repeated attacks on the head, body and thighs of a boring object.
"There have been too many families who have been suffering from brotherhood, when at least one student has died every year since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in his statement.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The great jury in Monroe County supported the prosecution of the third degree murder of the first five members.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also accused of violence and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to be solely responsible for individuals. If there is an organisation behind what has happened that has accepted the situation either officially or informally, they must also be held accountable", Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood to bomb its connection with the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. central bank raises interest rates
The rise in interest rates will come, and the emerging markets will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will have to decline.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long this will take, or how long it'll take.
The past does not provide much help in timing, especially as regards the economy.
The return has sometimes lasted only 11 months since the first rise, and sometimes as long as 86 months have passed.
The U.S. central bank's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a determining factor in how economic and financial resources react.
Therefore, the officials of the Central Bank of the United States have so strongly stressed that investors should not be focused on raising interest rates, but mainly on the development of normalisation times.
Indeed, there are several variables.
At the end of the day, however, market participants can find that all the withdrawals related to interest payments have been over-represented.
"The first increase after the global economic crisis of the Central Bank is inevitably interpreted in some areas to end the 'sading money' era," says the chief economic expert on the global affairs of Capital Economics, Julian Jessop, in his message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the U.S. interest rates to gradually return to normal, although still low, to a level that is changing, which many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effect.
There is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react on the basis of past developments:
As has been seen on the market in the last approximately one month, waiting for the interest rate to rise can make the situation unstable.
When emphasis becomes a fact, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for a period of 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy", according to Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the increase of the central bank.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, at an increase of around 14%, after the increase, the situation is fairly steady (mean increase of 2.6 per cent) for 250 days, and the normal state has reached an average return after 500 days in the last six cycles of 14,4 per cent, reports the recent analysis of Bob Doll’s leading capital strateg of Nuveen Asset Management, published in the Barron’s magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually clearer at a later stage in the increase cycle when the earnings begin to decrease.
Falling back is part of economic life, but interest payments often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not previously been met and can accelerate the recession.
In particular, this is the gross domestic product which will be closest to its lowest level of all time before the central bank’s interest rate buy-in.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 increases made since 1950 nominal annual GDP has only been below 4.5% twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will remain as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says the Atlantic Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic position may be risky and raises the question of whether this time is different," Deutsche Bank stated.
The market participants have made provision for an increase of the central bank throughout the year, and all expect this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, the future trade is only expected to be 25%.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all promotional cycles have so far experienced an increasing leverage effect in supercycles where GDP has passed its pre-renewal peak very quickly after recovery has started", reports the report.
On the contrary, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the Central Bank has been looking forward to the end of the last recession, with a record of 35 months, and it is now ongoing for the 74th month.
The fixed return has also been unstable as the market is waiting for interest rates, and the model reminds some of the findings of the capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects will be reflected more quickly in debt instruments than in shares.
The direction of return on bonds appears to be immediate for the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, the return on bonds will be reduced immediately", said Deutche Bank.
The Charles Schwab scales believe that the increase in interest rates leads to a convergence of return on longer and shorter-term debt securities, thus placing a level playing field.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about seeking return", Mr Schwab's solid return analyst, Kathy Jones, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the drop in the strength and inflation expectations of the dollar, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the prospects of a stronger monetary policy," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is even higher, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its line.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies with a lot of debt do worse when the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"The history shows that 'quality' shares are usually more profitable than after the first raise in three months', the Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their report to customers.
On average, after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, companies with strong net sales over the last five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and a low volatility of shares were more successful than those of lower quality. First, the average was 4 (percent) and 3 (percent) for the latter.
We're gonna have a big problem with our brother.
The companies with a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition, consumers can benefit from an increase in the dollar value outside the stock exchange.
Even though experts disagree on how fast the effect is, savers can also gain profits.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Congressman Andrew Bingham says
The conservative Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "discrimination"
He claims that it will become increasingly difficult to separate from a commercial competitor.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards prizes to say that they were just playing British Awards.
The Voice was criticised by Damien Collins, a congressman, saying that neither is original.
The BBC Radio 3 is "aligning" to Classic FM, claims that the leading MP adds the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
The conservative, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an impact on its 'nationalist' content, and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 doesn't want to use the term "nationalist" "is becoming a Classic FM," he said.
He also took his interest in the BBC Music Awards Prize, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just a different name from the British Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples directly remembered by me when you actually just copy something that I already have on the market," Bingham said.
The President of the BBC contested the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of his commercial partner on live music and sharing information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, primary.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than previously in order to reach the public, because the British knew less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for entering commercial competitors' toes during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Member of the Conservative Tory People's Party Damien Collins criticised The Voice, the music contest that BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not in any way unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George acted as star capitals, was produced "to the heart of the BBC style".
He added that he wants to "find success from the inside of his own house" of the production company the next time it starts the entertainment series.
He did not, however, agree to prevent the coming The Voice periods from being produced, or to impose on the other forms of entertainment that would be used to make the money available to the holders.
Online sales rose the least in August, Black Friday might be the reason
Net sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was an increase after the start of low statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that in November, Black Friday may slow down consumption
For over a decade, virtual purchases have grown enormously and transformed many of Britain’s purchasing fell into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a smoothing of online sales in the air, as the latest figures show only a 7% rise in the first quarter of 2015.
The total consumption of food grew at least since the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say that there is evidence of an increase in online sales levels in the air as the latest figures show only a 7 % increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels in previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become rational over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made purchases online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it's set-aside, and it can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been seen as one of the reasons behind slowing shops.
Experts believe that consumers control buying before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average of five times the number of buyers smuggled their computers to catch shops pouring out their many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who got buyers to argue about finding, can control the way they bought.
In a study published by the British Retail Consortium, it was found that only about one pound of five was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the net instead of using the fashion chains in their shopping bags.
The Muslims bury the dead in Meka's crane accident, the Bin Laden family of sanctions
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly accused the collapse of construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
In total, 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried through the streets in the air, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's great-grandfather.
Most of the white-dressed mortals filled the path to honor the first of the dead who made their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad course passed a holy place where only a few days ago the crane fell through the Moscow roof and fell the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family building group to a disaster, where 394 people were also injured.
29 bodies were carried through the streets by the worshipers who fell in Meka’s great scale.
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, who was the first saints when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the big house with his parents before the start of the annual hair-spouting.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the dawn of Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binlad Group should not have left the crane’s body up when it was not in use.
In the Arabic version of the decision published by Saudi Press Agency, led by the State, it was said that Binlad Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's leaders are prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore that he would find out what caused the cranes to fall in the courtyard of the Grandmountain, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before this month’s break-up.
The Binladin Group has not published reports on the crackdown and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal Decision also accused the United Nations of not using up-to-date protective measures and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Meka large scales, which are part of the huge building block led by Binlad Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruler family for decades, leading large building projects.
Osama bin Laden, the senior leader of Al-Qaida, was a rebel son whose family refused in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for the sanctification that every capable Muslim should do at least once in their lives.
Authorities tell me 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rialias to be paid to the families of the dead and permanently injured.
The rest of the injured get half of this amount.
The B&Q bomb says that the low-cost workers in Eastern Europe are behind popularity.
The British are increasingly using assistant services, Veronique Laury says
The number of workers coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a consequence, the Screwfix shops for professionals will open 200 more
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops around the country
Author of Ruby Steiner, City Secretary-General Daily Mail
The British are told to give up their hammers and paint chips and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home-building work
It seems that if you're smart with a hammer, or if you paint walls, you're a minority now.
You see the British hire more and more assistants to do tea and self-work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
The new Director General Veronique Laury, who owns the Kodinremont trading chain, said that the number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe is behind popularity and that they offer their services at a ridicule price.
This results in Kingfisher opening up 200 new Screenfix shops for employees and closing down 60 B&Q shops.
Laury said that she wanted to get more women to work for B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by the most beautiful sex.
Most of the staff today are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more one woman's economies where more household work is done than before.
Laury said, "There are still a lot of men in our sales personnel.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process."
Laury is only one of the five women leading up to the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index, and he has restructured his management team with equal numbers of male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with a level of 50 % of women, including its Director-General and its Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision... the difference is important here.
It's not hard to find good women in the board."
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both half a year's output and sales after the group took the costs of closing down the stores.
As a result of the Trend, the Kingfisher owned by Screenfix and B&Q stores is opening 200 new moves
The three ace governments decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The effects were very rapid.
The sharp head of the SAK and other wage centres began to force us to do the same thing, and as a result, the country will stand on Friday because of the widespread demonstrations of workers.
Time for many to think that there will also be a sense of reason.
Well, let's see if it's worth the sheets when it's not good anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet, stating that they are not going to participate in the demonstrations but are going to work.
In the old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was nothing on the Internet to protest, but openly declaring an offence would have been a small human political suicide.
Millions of trade unions few tens of thousands of people are not much at stake, but think about it.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the interesting point of view of the Ay movement’s activities, severe government solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
Once, for years, things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight, then, finally, the alliances will have the right to defend, defend, show and make good use of workers' rights.
In this way, the government may want to seize the role of ay movement when membership in the union is seen as perhaps more necessary than ever before.
Whatever it takes to act by organizations, it is silly that Friday's expression of mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped for quite some time.
For example, industrial production has already decreased for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
I think these things are gonna make everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lapland: target 8,5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The University of Lapland will start a savings hearing with a total of EUR 8.5 million in costs.
As part of the savings, the university will start the ‘yth’ negotiations for all staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be spent on other activities.
The background of the Yt negotiations is the 2016 budget, which is expected to be 8,5 million deficits in actual activity.
This will also be affected by the budget cuts made by the Government.
During this financial year, the university will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and the other funding will be EUR 3.2 million.
The university has a total budget of approximately EUR 85 million, so the saving target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate financing on our university is very important, says principal Anneli Pauli in the University of Finland.
Before summer, the effects of the surgery were even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with officials will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks under the law.
Yle: Lucky wants Finland's railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also aimed at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, says Souter.
Rail transport is expected to open gradually to competition.
The first is the immediate transport of the capital region in 2017-2018.
After close traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport, the Onnibus plans are welcomed.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has informed other international companies about its interest in rail transport, which also has bus and rail transport in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
The Central Bank of the United States must take decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows from the side when the Central Bank of the United States meets for two days Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether for the first time they will raise interest rates to almost a decade.
As Reuters conducts a survey for 80 economists, just over half of those who thought the Bank would raise interest rates last week believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, since when the central bank cut interest rates on zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central central central bank has the opportunity to get off zero levels and to start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Economics Senior Fellow.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought balance sheet billions of dollars and created little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore less Roses Global Views.
It has warned the market that they must be ready to rise, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After he shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before shooting her colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying that he was "indulging" for the first murder and hoped "to cancel it", told the authorities on Tuesday.
The Police Department of Mississippi Gautier reported that the teacher of land and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 at around 10:00 a.m.
Monday, he told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send out the police to his home.
He said he killed his wife last night, and he also mentioned that there was a "souled dog" in the house that "no one is disturbed," but probably shocked.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give us an explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, they found the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by a 45-year-old Lamb, saying, "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killed himself late on Monday at the police station.
William LaForge, Director of University, said that there was no contradiction between the Lamb and Schmidt to know that there was no conflict, but "There was clearly something in the mind of the Lamb".
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the claims made on Monday that Lamb would have believed that Prentiss was relative to Schmidt, there was no "law information or evidence" of any "three-thirds".
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good man".
A couple of them broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, who's "discreated".
O'Steen told me Prentiss and his daughter were "one of the best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked hand-in-hand online. Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police told their relatives that Lamb called somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail".
When the cops reached Lamp Road 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about educational science in Delta State in spring 2015, explains the CV on the University’s website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left) with his son Redmond (right) has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Words say he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this, in fact, requires its taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw got a double break on his right foot when Manchester United lost his PSV Eindhoven in the league of the Masters.
Even if the defender was in the barn and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would be able to play again this season.
The injury caused by Héctor Morenon's reckless tactics at 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated at 9 minutes and had to be given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe a day after that, and then we'll cut him in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18, he's having trouble, and then he's playing great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, she was wearing a oxygen mask.
She cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he received a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian agent was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged fight.
Shaw said, "Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and disappears to PSV
The British defender has an additional incentive to recover next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, they're all very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played against Van Galal in the Mexican team at the World Cup in 2014.
"Moreno takes this hard, because it is not intended to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that injury is really bad, it's bad stuff," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked as if [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's catch.
Moreno told SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Sformang challenged him.
I guess David Cameron knows Lorax better than this.
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it will not take long to learn it from outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the child care service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children’s book, he chose the Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax book, which was published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "The fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the following paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the book's plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to the rather short original text.
"In a city of Needle, where all nature is lost and even air is a commodity, Ted-boy hopes to win his dreams on the heart of the girl by filling Audrey's desire to see the right tree", the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write from his real name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this isn't yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the plot summary on the Internet Movie Database, which begins with the following: "In the city of Needlle in which everything is artificial and even air is commercial, Ted-boy hopes to win his dreams on the heart of Audrey's daughter."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he was so unacquainted with the book. In that young, anonymous boy hears how local nature has destroyed greedy, tree-creating, and needed-creating Kerskanen, without considering the short, fissile creature of Lorax, who "sounds for trees".
This relatively invisible PR task is probably for an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's informant said that the text must have come from Cameron's Electoral District Office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's personal identity, but did not comment at that time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from the British team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing Pakistan against the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for tour, I don't think that the repeat of the 3-0 serial destruction is likely.
I wouldn't shut down the foreign gain from the bills.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it includes good tourers and a strong team's thinking: they have no scars for 2012, only for a youthful positiveness.
Moeen Ali develops in her rounds, and Adil Rashid is an attacker's alternative, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped off of the British Cricket team, he replaced himself to become Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from the team is obviously difficult to analyse to me because I am his lead coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but terrible truth is that critics are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth season in the team could have continued, but he himself was responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more runnings for Yorkshire, the second chance comes up.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth’s attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is above all a team leader.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a hitter gets to leave a trail.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Compton was only given the opportunity to play both at home and in visitors.
The only subject of the complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean when Lyth was in a state of excellence, but that lost opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a hitter that I appreciate.
There's something we saw early in Yorkshire this season when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must at least be given the same opportunity as others before him, but this certainly depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in the batt shot at Cook, where an extra feeder could be placed on the field, but four quick ones could be kept, and I am not against it.
I don't understand why a hitter could not be hit there, and this left-handed has already shown himself to be quite a critic.
Moeen did not necessarily do her job in her Greek community in Worcestershire, but she is to them a third and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games at the first slow drop before moving into the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a thief in the team, and, little of what I've been dealing with him, he seems to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unflavoured statistics, hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35, and think it's a gambling game, but there's not too much of a feeder and the voters chose young people.
He learns a lot with this tour.
In addition to the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan striker Mkku Jayawarden as consultants in the games can prove a neronism.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and brings with him a huge number of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the white ball games, and brings both energy and pityless dazzling.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in international crises, then it was gambling or coaching, and he has the same uses as Mchain.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Collyn's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaching and choosing do not make timetables.
And you must remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a light basis.
The UK's departure from the EU (Brex) can take a profit if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategies to hold Britain in the EU are increasingly facing major problems from day to day, even if it is not even the hearty Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's choice of running the Labour Party or getting upset with the European Union's central organization of trade unions on Tuesday?
The foreigners also have their own Corbyni and Nigel Faragsa.
The European diplomatic buddy recently explained that since the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, of which not all are its fault, some Member States are tired of the self-involved agenda of the UK, which is full of disillusions and disruptive contractual changes which these countries do not wish to do most.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Centre of Trade Associations decided that they would not wish them both if they raped social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's Selfieagenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance are late at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves before the famous local monument, either with or without the local eyepiece, and then coming home saying that they will win the supporters of the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European fellow, who wants to look outwards inside the British EU tent - "Do not leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they do not care that we will not then be gone.
German careful and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her behind before it goes to the same thing as it did to the late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France, Français Holland, is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a disappearing force.
Poland may soon have a national right-wing government, a left-wing government in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice on behalf of the self-sufficients when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend presents, some of these ministers can even plan to make unconscious remarks to the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 referendum campaign in Britain to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renegotiated negotiations were a case" and "Renegotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have had a dire experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be, and how EU-sceptic press alone are, what they were not inspired by Tony Benny at the time of the 1975 referendum, when our membership began in 1973 was confirmed in the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who named himself by writing "EU direct bananas" when he was Brussels’s correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of taxing strangers, foreign telephones hacking foreign people and persons whose registered office is elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought of them exactly the same way, but realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, bananas must be handed over because of a spider unless you want to be on that gorilla lunch list and later on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more bliirish than Blair himself, when it came to opposing Cameron's renegotiation, because Bair had agreed on the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Blair the situation out of hand.
The press never forgiven him.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me at the Westminster Parliament Hall on Monday (I told him that he no longer had time to waste on me), would appear to be in danger of rescheduling Neil Kinnock's 80-century strategy of Murdoch, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he still has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, whom Corby, the BBC, left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, in a beautiful way, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain renewed in the EU.
Well, most of the people in the UK Independence Party outside Ukipi's militant passion for war and the persevering nationalistics of the Conservative party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week, when his inner patrolman would have wanted to admit that the choice of Corbyn to appoint the fugitive John McDonnell as Minister of Finance for the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law was on TV trying to be unfaithful to his colleagues in the Labour Party without going so far as to lose his position of government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But for the fight to stay with 'in any situation' - the statement by Benn - there was nothing that McDonnell said, and everything Corby told the principals and referees in private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever it is, it is an unscrupulous, emotional and personal image that Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important during the period of the 24-hour TV, and in particular in the circles of social media, which is acceptable to grow up in paranoids and frauds.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron an air ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep the Labour Party's support in the referendum campaign self-evident.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the basic cycle of McDonnel and Corbyn concerning EU membership (and in line with their Benn-based economy and its anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among left-wing thinkers for whom Narsism of small differences is a key dogma in the academic matches.
As regards his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby will not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their superiors.
Why would Paris or Berlin be worth wasting political capital (including suspicious voters) concessions to Britain when it can be totally unnecessary?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed at the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when I was under the influence of a cost cutting conservative government, as I was reminded of Monday at the start of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England’s electrical tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electric tobacco is 95% less harmful than conventional was the start of a 12-person meeting, with some contacts with the tobacco industry.
The experts writing British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with Lancet on the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electrical tobacco.
PHE published this report last month, describing it as a "table test of evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of information and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial that attacked the PHE's lead against the "extraordinary Hutera base".
Two other researchers who wrote in BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "constructed in rock or sand".
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor Martin McKee of Public Health, and Professor Simon Capewell of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that working methods must be set up for proven effectiveness."
They say that the public is waiting for the PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that electric tobacco is about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" based on a detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a meeting of 12 people who developed a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to give their opinion on the disadvantages associated with products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors at the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director said that he had previously received funding from the British American Tobacco Company for independent research.
He also supported Bat's public health mandates in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not from the funding he was told that he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they will increase.
The selection criteria for members of the panel are not mentioned, but the panel includes a number of well-known beneficiaries of electricity tobacco, some of which also report that they have received funding in the field of research.
Others who are present are not known for their expertise in the control of tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by the director of tobacco from PHE.
The study produced by the group "sufficiently admit" that there is a shortage of "undisputed evidence for most of the products and for most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claim that there is no proof that the electric tobacco is a route to smoking children or non-smokers.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of PHE's health and well-being, says that the arguments put forward in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "The fires are much less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who burn their lives die of addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electricity tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence looks like and what it does, especially when there is so much public awareness of relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die from smoking-related diseases every year and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if the electric tobacco is not risky, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we fill our national responsibility zone.
BBC might want to give up East Eders, says former Channel 4 leader.
The former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as East Eders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" on ratings such as this soap series on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that license fees should only be used to produce programmes that are not done by other British broadcasters.
He criticised BBC's fact that it would put in public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience, difficult to broadcast to the most popular competitors against programmes and channels such as the BBC4.
After Tony Hall, CEO of the BBC, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he had to come to Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC will produce and send programmes that would clearly agree with unsub-sufficient competitors", Johnson pointed out to the communication committee at the upper room as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is held up - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this medium or for the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and do not do.
The Voice is sent to the most important delivery time because it is wanted to gather as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of nobody else showing the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should be financed by programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one of those and East Eders another, without denying the inside of the house implemented.
To be honest, the other channels would give anything.
I don't understand what it's about sending a public service.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all."
The serial entrepreneur Johnson who led Channel 4 in 2004-2010 said that BBC is responsible for hunting the number of viewers "because of the objectives of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the most popular series of BBC's comments to the former Sky leader Tony Ball's comments. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to propose that the BBC sell series like East Edinburg.
Johnson said that the public service programmes of the lower audience "go to the BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its area of responsibility and then can, in defence of the EUR 4 billion license incomes, be artificially declared that, of course, we are doing all of these unknown programs, which no one sees".
They'll put them at a mission where no one ever comes to see them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson said to the committee, "I'll see you look for a more regressive system on who gets the most value of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for people for whom 150 pounds are big money, because they don't use much of the BBC.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its early task of "to inform, train and entertain the Committee".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that the figures were 1% of TV production and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should be modelled on Australia's and Canada's radios, and changed the task to the form of 'information, education and entertainment'.
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which, according to him, only some appear on TV, and join commercial companies in such a way that they can all be seen online.
The "noise genetics" allows brain cell control by means of sound waves
The video shows how shuttle ponds change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have raised worms with genetically modified nerve systems to be able to control them by sound waves.
The small sized shuttle ponds change direction as soon as they hit the sound pulse, which is too high to hear the human ear.
Impulse function by connecting genetically modified commercial nervous system cells with ultrasonic response channels.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms show the operation of a new method named audio genetics, which allows the ultrasound to be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body by hand.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher of the Salk Institute in California, La Jolla, told The Guardian that one day the method can replace deep brain stimulation.
The shuttles did not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by fluid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that bubbles strengthened ultrasounds that then go inside the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4-ion channels, structures that are in the cell membranes of some worms.
The sound waves will open and activate these ion channels, which are attached to them, as reported in the report published in Nature Communications.
To prepare ultrasonic conductive shuttle ponds, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their brain cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasounds for modified worms, microclumps confirmed sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they turned on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a urarated tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent from the optic to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue in an accessible way, so they can be sent to the brain from the head of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it may be possible to obtain the target human nerve cells to react immediately to ultrasound in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertising Intrudes Britain’s arms trade
Look at the video against Amnesty International's arms fair.
It's a terrible killing machine!
My ankles are shattering leg irons!
Ryebombs!
And electronic stun pumps that cause painful pain but don't leave a trail!
The happy voice and the comic language of the series leave no doubt that this world's largest arms fair advertising is a sharp parade produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the British government's willingness to trade weapons for the repression of the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre in London's shipyard.
Subject: DSEI Arms Fair: Autoritarian Governments arrive in London
With a separate campaign, there were also many posters for bus stops and subways, which require more accurate access.
"The important information, do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together, you will be asked using the underground font and brand of London, as DLR's track turned into a picture of the tank.
In this September, a pack of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists who worked at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Public Designs).
A collector named Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages, which includes six pound packs of hexagonal keys, which, according to a collective, are "access to a third of the entire planet's bus stop advertising space".
Transport for London is not interested in this unauthorized "public vandalism".
It's a special pathol group made of parody commercials.
According to Cruel Designs and University of Essex's journal Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political work to outside the gallery.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in the opposition front when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arm trade poster greets business travelers on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over the last 24 hours more than 100 000 times. It was created by VCCP for free, as well as by a graphic designer and background monitor working for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that the arms fair was not advertised at all - and there was also an empty spot in ExCeL's calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic advertising of vague corporations, but "it was more to stop it with bright colors and animation".
"They've done fantastic work to help us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at fairs," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
Now the UK Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art of the arms fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when the exhibitionists trade fantasticly decorated products.
It revealed in press release that it received orders from the U.S. Army "from the bottom of the trigger AT4CS RS".
This includes "a high-quality piping machine that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student home
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student apartment when I wasn't aware, and then I believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now I remember the crowds of people I've been annoying, and many, long complaints to others.
A large part of what I learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment can be anything that's completely scary about the nerves.
It's attractive to be drawn from: to tell you what you're from, whether you're in the middle of the year and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a wedding news HAHAHAHAHA I find in my room".
Take your breath.
And help others also to take the spirit... ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find the people you love, not those you would not like to talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would share the extinguishers.
Give people room.
People’s rooms are often transformed into cocktails, the pies of the movie studios, and the entertainment guide, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Subject: Don't even imagine starting a university when you're in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but in many residential areas there is a culture of walking from one room to another, which is friendly, social and leads to lifelong friends.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect the energy I spent when I talked to you."
Try to sense when the student friend is tired of socializing, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when the speech came, knock.
A guy in my student home thought if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some things.
Befriended by baking.
Since you're starting the university in the peak season of the bread-tender, knocking people's doors with a chocolate sandwich and showing yourself seems to be a little less strange, less "goody for the neighborhood, I'm making something for you, now smile when I ask you about your personal questions" -50s.
It's a great way to make friends with yourself.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will combine your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to make bread.
Badly mixed flour-cooker-fathogs are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
I understand it's stealing some chicken, but what if you just take the tint's milk for your tea?
Ask the owner of the milk.
It's quite possible that they'll give you permission, even if they're insinuating.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more grown up than my roommate, who mixed the laundromat in her milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to make noise so people don't get to sleep or study.
It's not just to be a decent person, it's because you're like the pot of a proverb playing a roof.
In my hallway, the girl asked her neighbor if they could play Drum and bass music later because she had three o'clock in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly allowed them to sleep two hours before she put her own music in the moaning, locked her doors and went to the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse moved into the same apartment with you?
Or in a reverse way, would it not be incredibly awkward for you to consider a roommate to be your future spouse, to be together, to resign, and then to see him every day and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course your heart wants what you want, but if a hot roommate is not really your future spouse, you might even try to reason with your bottom.
In that exhilarating moment, when you find that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the line between being wrought and bullying is weaker than it seems.
Well, that's a good trick, but you can't cancel in a minute.
You can teach the safety of useful and fun by hiding something, but don't you ever mess up someone's room with a toothpaste and a shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, then put them in the freezer, but don't attach their property to the ceiling with a blue star as long as twice.
The racist attack on Kite at the home of foreign students - The house designed as a reception center was smuggled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made at the home of foreign students in Kite, North Karelia.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not accommodation facilities for minors, but sleep facilities for foreign students who have already been in Finland, says Heidi Luukkanen, teacher of the Evangelical Institute of Kiev.
The windows and walls of the public school’s accommodation facilities were carved with racist signs, such as hares, and a metal object had been thrown through a window in one of the accommodation rooms, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkanen, the building targeted by violence was estimated at 10 people during the attack.
"There was a weekend and grown-up people are free to move, so some may have been elsewhere," says Luukkainen.
The National College has a housed population of 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as newly arrived minors.
All those who are involved in the building have a-stations.
Part of the study is adult education, part is vocational studies and part is studying Finnish", Luke explains.
A status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for a period of four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigates the attack as an injury and a violation of home peace.
A press conference was held on Monday, which included the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and nobody wanted to leave.
We have had 20 years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens," says Luukkainen.
The lock says the mess's already been cleaned out of the wall.
At least three men were suspected of being made, and they had been on the move by a light passenger car.
I think this is the end of the Youth weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
It's nothing more serious," says Luukkainen.
Salo also has a hospital designed for reception facilities.
It happened last week.
She told me about it on her website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was surrounded by a hammer and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a criminal report to the police.
Specification 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y-jun for the pack - passengers in their chewing hands, "Old idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepor, Karya, will cease to run in March.
The news made it difficult for passengers to get to the beginning of the train at Helsinki Main Railway Station.
In particular, the submerged river strikes the siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström, the municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time, and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be against anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says that an interview video of HSTV is coming with a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in New Zealand.
H-and R-rail trains are combined into a new R-line.
The station of Purola in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be left out of service.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced information on the routes to buy train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will vary at the turn of the year and the route to be terminated will be throughout the country.
A new four-year agreement finalising in autumn will be adopted later by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, Siuntiolainen, considers that the State train cutlery is a short-term activity.
We make the same mistakes that have been made earlier and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be regret.
Y trains are also used by non-Raaseporians and Siunthios, as it is quick and overcoming several stations.
On the train, Annina Pöyry, Espoo, was upset by the fate of those who traveled further from the city area.
"It is especially bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said in his pain on the Y-train.
A little relief is allowed.
There must be a new train connection on the beach that will replace the Y-jun in the Helsinki Region of Transport (HSL) area, i.e. to Kirkkonummi.
This brings additional costs to HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now going to explore different options and their impact on the level of services and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, Executive Director of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate costs.
It says that according to the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million years of the Y train, the Ministry of Justice of course much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves two positions behind.
Instead, the number of train shifts is doubled in Ainola and Saunakallio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys rail traffic from the roads of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Siinajoki.
The Pieksämämäki-Joensu route is shortened to the route Pieksämämäki-Varkus.
The trains are reduced on the routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are carried out on the basis of a total of around nine million journeys purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to provide the state with 12,3 million annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in the book “Marxin is worth studying”
The global economic crises have led Karl Marx to the surface (1818-1883) and his final report, published in 1867-1894, to Finland, to write the current state of Marx's capital, known as the former president of GDP, Yrjö Hakane.
"He is now being taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his first speech.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy in all areas of life increasingly, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazing.
You can also find Aalto University professor, a highly respected economist, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx is a topical "forever and ever".
But isn't the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and Economics' delegation Marxian?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not think Marx is a timely economicist but rather an interesting social theoryist.
Today, social sciences are isolated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociology, economist, journalist, political agitator and lessons of literature.
"The idea is that the architect tells of the wrong opinions of the dead men," Korkman starts.
It's true that Marx's predictions went awfully wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early magic of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most important thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now again discussing Marxin's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that changes as a result of a technical upheaval", Korkman's analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help from Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Marxi's idea of getting to know him is to get to know him.
"In the '70s, Marx was unable to read," says Korkman.
"The Mao and the Trotskians and the other sects hated all capitalism, but even more one another."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weightings of the hives.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mind world, like the other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations is calling for war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to investigate the war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as the Matilists.
The civil war in Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the massive attack of the armed forces in the last months of the war should be examined properly in 2009, the UN report calls for.
The report on Sri Lanka's armed forces blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual assault, which was as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been forced into coercion between the other and the children.
According to the report, both sides have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it was going to organise the investigation itself, but it does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
The English yo test allowed the social media to be weighed
On Wednesday, New York, there was a long foreign language, which was English for most of it.
More than 16,000 pilots tested their English skills.
It could have been a social media test.
Based on their own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the 150-250 English word could show the editor of the journal’s board of counseling.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for Finnish Leelia rest chairs.
He had to be asked how parents would be able to look at matters from the point of view of young people.
In total, there were four subjects, one of which was to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them," evaluated the third topic of Porvoo Swedish high school in English, Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was merely a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was very nice.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least at our school we've been trained to write our speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment "which is normal".
In Finnish or Swedish - the English test, questions were answered about texts that contained, for example, the adaptation of the summer balconies to climate change and the handling of large amounts of information.
Some long Russian (68 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, with another native, Swedish, or Finnish experience in turn.
In high schools, the test is normally organised, that is, the expression of the employees does not affect it.
The University Board calls for pilots to search for suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the test event.
A further period may also be obtained if you can demonstrate that your lateness was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, the store was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu, Wednesday morning, the store was robbed in the City of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper had been dressed in dark clothes and a commando who covered his face.
A man is normal and is about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the crew with a hand gun and received a small amount of money.
They're looking into this as a gross robbery.
Police are expecting tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
A mental expression against government cuts will be blocked at Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting police.
According to preliminary information, there may be up to tens of thousands of people arriving.
Members of the SAK, Akaksen and STKC alliances will meet at the Rautatientor at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in demonstrations.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarms and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the giant speech.
The roads leading to the railway corridor shall be closed from motor vehicles for the period from 9.30 a.m. to 14.
Only alarm vehicles will be allowed to enter the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, the traffic is cut off from the traffic circle of Kaisaniemi, from the direction west of Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it looks like enough.
I'm not taking a position on the police work fights.
According to Helsinki, Helsinki is coming from other Finland due to mental expression.
The police don't tell the exact patroller.
"Sometimes it's coming, but basically we'll be fine with our own," says Kujala.
The police are asking to avoid private car rides in central Helsinki on Friday.
The alley estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to early afternoon.
There are also a lot of subscription buses coming from Finland with protesters arriving from elsewhere.
They won't be released to the Railways.
The buses are going to be a long way from now.
The rest of the trip will then have to walk to the point of demonstration," Kujala says.
The spirit expression also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side.
The issue of the flow of public transport, which is normally at these large gatherings of people, is now partly self-handling.
The organisers of the media have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mental expression to go smoothly.
People are ordinary unemployed or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
There are also local demonstrations taking place across Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstrations are in many ways exceptional - do you remember these laws and demonstrations?
In many ways, the great demonstrations organised by the trade unions on Friday are interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Emeritus Martti Siisiinen, professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't do that, it would raise your hands in front of the government," Sisinen says.
A well-righteous government has hit the cores of the tradition of Finnish corporateism - and also points that have been important to the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard records are missing in the contract law.
Here are a lot of features that are really trying to get the Ay movement to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look at the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have all employees' support for Friday's demonstrations.
The new one is now the steep division which is brought about by the expression of mind among those whose ay movement would like to participate in the demonstrations.
The unemployed gathered from across Finland showed their views at the Parliamentary Hall in November 1993.
If you're looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstrations, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostors, who were organized in 1993, says Sisine.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorsta collected 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (centres) government was colliding from the labour market crisis to the second.
It was said that the differences between the Finnish government and the employees' organisations were never as bad as they were during the Aho porvary regime.
Now the range between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than during the time of the Murrostorsta.
In addition, there is now a Finland’s very poor bourgeois government, says Siisiinen.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is such a strict right despite the Finnish talk.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time.
Several thousand protestors are expected to be present on Friday.
The spirit expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day care as well as schools.
Although the expression does not receive the undistributed support of the employees, it can become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, about 300 demonstrations have been held annually in recent years.
They're all over the top.
Traditionally, Finnish protests of ay movement have been quite peaceful - although the practice has been hard in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict; they are law-abiding.
Prosecutors strive to avoid damage or destruction of property, Sisinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of interest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw chicken eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The fireman strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes, among other things, by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these sheets and demonstrations?
1970's metal and electric strikes
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power and electricity strike in 1977.
The metal men's strike involved 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended on the proposal of the Reconciliation Board for seven weeks.
Metal men got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused hives all over the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people met on behalf of the Parliamentary House, many of which made the recession unemployed, to express their opinion on the work.
Firemen stopped for three months in 1998.
The fireman strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were subjected to egg fever in protests against farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops", was one of the slogans.
Espala's farmers were snoring snow tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn hays in front of the meeting site.
Depositors closed in 1983 and 1995
For about a month, nurses ceased to exist in 1995.
For the last time, they had been in strike in 1983.
Some deaths occurred during the strike in 1995.
The operation threatened the strike and the mass transplantation of nurses in 2007.
In the end, it was the result of the talks that led to the threat of mass isolation.
Doctors closed in 2001
"The doctors in the strike - from the escape", was part of the strike of the law enforcement doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centres and hospitals lasted five months and brought about a lively debate on the possible risks to patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
About 5 000 students marching for study support from the Senate to the Parliamentary Hall in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Crime Police will find out about the backgrounds of the Finnish border with the Austrian police.
The Austrian police has asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in resolving the backgrounds of the refugee regime registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped Aisterheim near the border of Germany on a truck with 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
They were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and primary responsibility are located in Austria, explains Commissioner Tero Haapala of Central Crime Police.
At the end of the lifetime, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to the General Radio, the truck belongs to the Finnish limited company.
The company is engaged in restaurant activities, for example, and its CEO is a foreign-style man, about 40 years old.
Two Irakilaisms have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
A refugee farting captain, a former drug addict and a high-level businessman, the story of five smugglers
Uploric smuggler king, violent boatboy, a stylish missionary, and himself a good guy cab driver.
For example, such people engage in trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, working at Trento University, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their book Death Travel Office is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the plots of trafficking in human beings, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different stairs of business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
On the east coast of Tunisia, the islands of Kerkenna do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for a summer visit.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also perfectly suitable for smuggled transport, as the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives in a chain of burning captains and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for fishermen to carry people.
This is what Emir has done with its blue, ten - foot - long wooden veins hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full of feathers, 40 people can fit it.
One trip Emir makes about 8 000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for her clients around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunnes wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again as a result of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna island in small groups.
Emir will stay in empty houses for as long as he can see good.
Food is given so that customers are just going to survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going to go out in the middle of the night, in a mild place.
The first night, you drive off the island, then stop it, wait a day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is heavy, and passengers are crying and vomiting in waves of 20 metres high.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been landed within half an hour and Emir is on the way back.
Emir wants people to fear him.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least he claims to beat the players to death.
He says in the book that once the police jumped him, he threw all his passengers over the side of the ship and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I picked up customers on one neck and threw them over the top," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come south of the Sahara.
He says he's going to have to abuse this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
It's a normal cab ride.
Goran is the usual cab driver in Bogovasha, Serbia.
His cab's not very good at the starter engine, and anyway, he's seen the best of his days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving across and moving towards Hungary's border.
Bogovasha is about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch in 500 inhabitants.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly released.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their families are located in tents, ceilings and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
Also, families living in the forest who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for a reason or another.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Gora finds most of his clients.
These are often stolen exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings of borders and weeks of walking trips in difficult rural areas, often mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the Bogovasha area, in the knots of the great trafficking of human beings, people are dead.
Goran's cytins are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis, and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he'll tell you in the book.
"They say their business once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to do it.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
That's bullshit all the way.
First the price is agreed at 300 euros, for example, then they fall to 200 and finally offer 150 euros.
Goran points out that he's a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he works cheaper than others and that he can bill for his ride to Hungary's border only EUR 50 per person.
It's a three-mile trip, most of it's comfortable on the highway.
My colleagues say they're asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a big deal for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice year's return in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be transported more than 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rides a mile away from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and shakes off.
The Work of Loneliness
A 35-year-old Congoleseman is called a missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
He truly has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where there are many believers who have fled from Congo, as well as a small center to help the Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Ambassador runs the smuggling business, where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber strip of white larvae is elegantly strangled from under the low waist of the jeans.
A missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the client calls from one of the five telephone numbers of the Ambassador.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money from the visor and pass the border among the traders.
In order to obtain asylum seekers or refugee status, the Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have been forced to flee their homes from violence.
Often it's true, but if not, the Ambassador will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old ID card will be destroyed and another ID will be acquired.
That's where the Ambassador's contacts in Uganda's police will help.
The customer is then directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, the NGOs, finally the UN refugee organisation UNHCR.
The missionary feels bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He will pay about a hundred euros to apply to the Ugandan police, about 150 documents to the humanitarian organisation, and a process of migration to, for example, a European country of EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice-cream
Tom's a starter smuggler, former drug addict.
A four-year-old Irish is on the coast of France, calling on Calais, where his job is to deliver people to trucks on the way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French cab and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know they are in human secret transport business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from some people in the center of Calais.
They're driving A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go directly to prison to organise illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting here for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs across the freeway of his customers to the rest of the place where the drivers sleep before they continue to cross the canal across the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it's on its way to England, not even Holland, and cut through the protective cover.
It has to be done quietly, so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's on the run, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wrapped his client in aluminium foil, the same thing that is being wrapped around a roast or oven in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police heat scanner from finding out who's hiding.
Some use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping he doesn't drive suddenly before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous humanists.
In Uporical Turkish has been called champion of marketing and undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean lands, who controls maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only requires money.
One of the new methods is the luxury shipwreck: Turkish ports are rented with pleasure bars to bring American or European families to tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, ships are loaded on a sample of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which will first be transported from Istanbul to a port and sea to Europe against a charge of EUR 5 000-7 000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until they are ready to leave.
People are closed to minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When given, the ship must be boarded quickly.
Passengers must keep their distance below deck hidden.
The Marine Guard can only observe the depth of the ship swimming, as no other sign of the human population is visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers are expelled and vomited, the better.
Küçük receives about 53 000 euros for one luxury ship after the expenses.
He does not do practical things himself, but employs captains, recruiters, guards, reptiles and other smaller factors to do the work for him.
There are at least hundreds of transportations during the summer period and millions of Kéçük makes.
He is estimated to have purchased over 100 apartments through cover companies in the country, a pharmaceutical company and over 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Since then, apparently, he's gone.

American Olympics reports in their book about their illness and their becoming a prostitute
Three times at the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton reports in his book about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published bitter books on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at Sydney Olympics.
He got into a race in top order and ran for the second time.
But in the final, he was panicking.
He immediately attacked the top at the beginning and defended his leadership on a manic run.
Yet, his powers were strengthened 150 meters before the goal.
He fell into the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I packed myself over the line of goals, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton was suffering from two-way mental disorder.
His brother Dan had done a year before Sydney's races committed suicide, and he himself felt tremendous success pressure.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There were no financial problems in Paris, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money to have sex with other men.
He also overdosed with his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He tells me he spent money in his luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of becoming a prostitute was also that he needed similar adrenaline ticks as he had been competing in public sports.
Later on, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star drinker came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was at 1500 metres in the world’s statistical cycle of 3.57.40, but remained last in Sydney’s Olympicfine.
The world champion was glad to see the alliance strangled the Norwegian ski resort:
The Norwegian skiing queen Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of conformity in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the sports agreement throughout the summer and autumn, like last year.
Even though the Union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for the multi-time world champion and the Olympic winner.
As a result of the treaty conflict, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the future World Cup.
The decision received thanks from the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance had taken the skis out of him.
"Thank you for showing me the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow an active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently wants to be part of the season of the country team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that also takes care of future generations and does not give up one athlete in the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union had given Northug both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different rule than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own announcement in which he convinced him that he would like to be brave in Norway's colours next season in the world Cup, as well as in the MMs and the Olympics.
With her career, Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MMs, of which two gold medals.
He was in Falun last winter with a team who won a communication cult.
The shielding date of the patent translators will also be celebrated in the North Pole.
On the day of the race, 25.9., campaigns are held in different restaurants and shops, which have been issued a shield from the Paistin translators.
The aim of today is to highlight Finland's high-quality food sector skills and to lower the threshold for entering the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of its high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but there are top restaurants controlled and classified by an impartial operator around Finland.
The international attention received is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the sensitivity of the thyroid glands and the organization.
In the North Pole, the day is held at the restaurant in Vaasa, Fondinen and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the turtle day participates in the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events to be held in the same day around the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Long-distance newspaper: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of a district reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhavan ex-space currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region remains permanently located in critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Erillisverkot Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building set would constitute a significant risk of safety, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, defence forces may have interests in the area of the former Airport School and the airport, the effect of which has not also been clarified when preparing the reception centre, writes.
The report states that for the last two years there have been negotiations on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, inter alia, with Mr Jussi Niinistö (ps) and with Mr Arto Rädy, Head of the Ministry of Defence.
The private person points out to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a question of fundamental opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned location in the former equipment area is wrong.
Last Monday, the City Government of Kauhava dealt with the reception centre.
Ninth: The situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The government means that immigrants and those here will have the necessary circumstances, the Niinistö commented on the suppliers in the evening after meeting the Presidents of all the Parliamentary Party in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about managing the refugee situation were shared among all the participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the fundamental issues.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to the Niinistung, the situation in Syria and the situation in Russia and the United States can also have an impact on Ukraine and the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistna is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Niinistö, the NATO question was also mentioned in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

The Agency shall authorise further changes in its activities to be notified tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipil take a big risk
According to the Sipil, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio speeches are one of the other channels.
A channel of this kind of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, but Sipilä said to the journalists in the Parliament.
The wing did not want to assess the frequent way the Prime Minister will make television and radio calls.
According to the wing, talks may not always be conveyed in the future by Ylen channels.
If other channels report as channels, we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to the Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires holding television and radio talk to citizens.
This whole matter, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipila figured it out.
The speech will be sent from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
The wings take a big risk
The media investigator hopes that Sipilä's TV talk will not tell us more about the in-house transformation of the government.
Is it an attempt to take greater control of the right to define public debate and refuse public debate on the issues raised by the University of Stockholm, Professor Anu Koivunen.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin recently commented that he did not follow the media agenda and let it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things will not be linked.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media has been heartened by the announcement of Sipilä.
It'd be weird if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not about reporting issues in democracy.
It is up to the media to have a definition of not taking up politicians' agents.
According to Koivuinen, the TV speech is a big risk to Sipila.
In his speech, the wing should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations of the speech are fulfilled.
Is there more of what we've heard today?
Or is he able to talk to a different person in a different way or in a different way or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only an increase in the same old one, we must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In particular, there is a risk in this respect when it is not a particular situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is identified as a medium of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle's interest or general line.
A wingy bet
In the forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important.
Tonight, we have to look carefully at where Sipil is missing and not where, says research coordinator Heikki Kuutti, Jyväskylä University.
According to the moon, the TV speech is a smart bet from Sipil, because this is the way to bring forward its own views without a sound of oppression.
This will enable the general public to do so without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The chip will pass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, it is a risk that the media is wrong to interpret the speech because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä is on TV, whether sweats, shaking hands.
He compares Sipila to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to do his thing well, it can work.
The situation is different from that of the government to inform something, because it is a person who speaks directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners regularly do.
It's really extraordinary.
The Prime Minister's speech to the citizens is truly exceptional by the political scientist Erkka Railo.
According to him, it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
The exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants Finns to be sane about the challenges ahead.
On Friday, wage organisations organise demonstrations and strike against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the left-wing movement, says on Twitter that Sipilä could speak about the status of the nation as the Prime Minister's announcement, which would allow us to discuss the speech as well.
Mr Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces his challenge for Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologs.
It'll be six months from the election.
You can't hide from the finals, Rinne writes on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
THE boy's father updated his Facebook pages.
The Home Finland Police Department will also confirm the matter to the evening press.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later this evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks all those people who help us find him.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was divided closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent bullying of young people: You are making anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a sad-looking freelancer, published a video on Facebook, which calls in particular on immigrant backgrounds for young people.
Mr Amirkhani stressed the emphasis on young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving at Finland at five years of age with his family, has won both his professional match in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
There are video downloads on the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed with the wilding of young people.
Amirkhan, a 26-year-old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick on the ground, sit on the other, and play blindly without thinking about any of these consequences, what happens when you make videos like this, Amirkani updates.
It's hard to defend.
Some of the young people displayed on video are migrant backgrounds.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, the fighting videos for social media have been downloaded by immigrants and by Finnish young people.
That's exactly the fact that you're fighting across the street.
You are doing so much more difficult in the lives of so many other immigrants here in Finland, Turkish Amirkhani reminds you.
Amirkhani reminds us that Finland has websites looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite gross.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be a long time guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If sometimes they become the target of someone's racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go with that kind of guy.
Amirkhani says that violent activity gives rise to racism.
You're making me hate that I don't like myself.
You're going to have a pretty bad situation, and you're not going to get any better than that, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, SAK President Lauri Lyly says that the employees' organisation will consider its position on Monday as an alternative list of savings.
Laurie Lyly commented on the STKT's proposal on Twitter.
earlier on Wednesday, the Staff Centre Organisation informed the Government of its own proposal to achieve the 5 % productivity cut requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
The current Chairman, Mr Fjäder, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STKK and the Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, this would require that the largest wage earner organisation, the SAK, soften its position.
On behalf of the SAK President, Lauri Lyly commented firmly on this issue on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lylyn, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market gap" and there is a need for agreements between the active parties in place of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Government of Prime Minister Sipilä for a social agreement did not qualify for the SAK.
In the past, the Sipila broke the negotiations on the social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5 % profit margin.
Comment: There's a danger of a big smile - "It's a bit funny to put on a fist"
It's a bit funny to put on a fist, if there's already a pekka tiinane in the pocket, write Pekka Tiinane.
The moods vary from person to person in the wage camp to person.
Is it supposed to call off the government, or is it settled?
On Monday, SAK's federal leaders were smuggled in holy hatred against the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut it down.
The cloud even spread to the wretched ones.
OAJ, a teacher's trade union, threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, the OAJ withdrew: no school or day-care centres will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) president of the STKC Staff Centre Organization took an agreement.
He said that he had contacted the government and that he had prepared an alternative proposal by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) for a 5 % profit cut.
The current president, Mr. Sture Fjäder, was rushing to announce immediately that his compromise paper was ready.
At first, the SAK's office didn't belong in the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree on the occasion of the commanders on Monday who ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAC bureau will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAC will seek solutions for the opening of the labour market gap.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAC should tend to accept a 5 % profit cut as a target.
There is no wonder that Palola STKT has relations with Sipila’s government in order.
The right hand of Palola, the head of STKC’s social adjustment director Jukka Poisus, previously served as special assistant to the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanaksen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described that ay-skilling of the government has been improving all the time.
Incidental or not, but Palola's exit took a bit off from the Finnish stationers, whose figure was excavated by the ACP-Marko Piulainen (sd).
I'm sure it's kind of funny to put on a fist, if there's already a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This cannot happen again"
Mr Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian duuman, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to the Russian duum President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Finland.
In Ula Bator, the main city of Mongolia has started the meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Festival.
In that case, Finland did not allow the arrival at the meeting of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced by the European Union - a matter on which the President mentioned journalists.
We estimated that it was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't happen again. Naryshkin stressed according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was directed at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The Sanctians are political suicides from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
So Naryshkin continued to squeal Finland by congratulating and thanking Mongolia for its "special organisation".
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will proceed constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that Parliamentary dialogue does not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed Russia's delegation.
The lock meets the real Playoff mirror: "Mals on tight"
The killer and the Snow will continue today in Hakamets' bully days when both of them are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today at Hakamassa, there will be no actual goal party.
The killer came to Kuopio last night to fake a 3-2-way victory from KalPa.
The rise was a manly thing, for last season's silver team was at its worst two goals of defeat.
The lock on Tuesday was more molli-winner.
The Chinese catch-started Blues' guest was a round zero point, and the losing figures were also two to three.
Hard game, goals on tight, if any play similar to last year's, Lock-up Janne Lahti foresees settings on the side of the club.
The killer has become quite a Playoff nightmare for the Roma.
In the last two years, the killer has just dropped off from the final series of Lukko.
Both layers require a crucial seventh match.
During the last season, the Lock took the show out in the fourth game, but Tappara got up on three next side and over.
There are no major changes in group configurations except for paint foams.
The two guys who rejected them last night are gonna get a big shift today.
With the kill best paint Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the lock-up pins Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
View angle: Bad play going on in the ace
Toivola, Director of Sports, wrote the inappropriate extension of Chief Coach Rautakallio, writes from Santtu Silvennoinen Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie where he himself played the main part.
The Altavator sensationally put a heavyweight series on Apollo Creed, the world champion.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost a title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a non-violent ash story in Pori.
Unnamed and tree-stained son of a bitch moved to everyone's surprise for the SM-final in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous guys like Rocky, but tough underpants.
There were white Indians, Pori Matti and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, players dyed their heads red and cut the Irish.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The cops took the defeated silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The author hopes that the novel of this season will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man working as director of an open sports operation has built a pagan for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting waste in their necks like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are out of play somewhere other than kiekoli.
Hope has forgotten that Rocky VI plays the main part of Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi is baptized at the Sean Connery of Rautakallion.
Rautakallio is a writer at London, Rocky, who is as squeaky as the main performer as Connery would have been in the original book of 1976.
There's nothing left in the Iron Rocky except the nickname.
The philosophy of the iron wave is not a matter of rushing and a little biting.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's different to play hard as a pig.
Last season, the Aussie Garrett Stafford was in the back of Tappar's Jere Karjalainen head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Ironhall put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have people who deserve to play.
I don't accept that kind of game, and it's not part of the bush, and after the game, I'm not sure if it's hot, I'm just going to go to the nation of Satakunta.
The Open Team of this season has been strangely built.
There's trains, veterans, cops, and defendants.
There are virtually no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The recent period's events affect procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, and Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
I'm going down the road.
The 1953 Rautakallio model is well-knownly interested in moving to Hope as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The public balance in the three leagues of the season has just as many losses with the difference in goal of 1-6.
Tolola wouldn't have supported the script extension part.
Olga Temone plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband as Tuuka's teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's guidance.
Yeah, I'm doing my husband's friend's mom in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actor and a producer Olga Temone laughs.
He has been married to Apulannan ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The couple have worked together a lot before, but now Olga is acting under Tuuka's guidance for the first time.
I've played a role in helping you out of our beautiful film in the early years of the year. The rubble Sipe Santapuki's mother Sirkka.
The sirkka semppa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (who plays Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I learnt about my true example in Sirka, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in this role.
Olga had already met Sirkan before the film project, but since then the twins have come close.
They've met, talked on the phone, communicated.
The sirkka has done so much to help.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
And luckily, sirkka realizes that drama is drama and that the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Helpland would become the largest band in Finland.
In the late '90s, it was flat and really intense.
There was a pretty small probability that someone really could, but Sirka had some kind of inspiration, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukka since she was young before film plans.
However, the parents’ stories have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s evil sketter.
Olga was a common and nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At most, he could've secretly been in love.
According to Olga, during the 10 years she has worked so much with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been a very good thing.
Now the whole production team is going to go to Heinola for a month.
However, because of their small children, a couple living in the East is often going to drive home at night, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take Heinola for a month.
They have accepted us warmly, only asked which streets and when to be emptyed.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland's most expensive drama movie
The budget for the Iron Sky, led by Timo Vuorensola: The Cosing Race, is EUR 17 million.
The shoots start in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifiefilm Iron Sky's extension, Iron Sky: The Cosing Race, will rise to the most expensive play film ever in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
The title of the most expensive Finnish film has been at the Jalmar Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation that is being made is also rising by the Iron Sky 2 as the film's budget is over EUR 100 million.
In October, photos of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begin at the AED Studios, near Antwerp, and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I've been sick and relaxed!
I've got such a casual file script because I know exactly what kind of movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell the Night's Day.
Initially, 8-10 million were designed as a film budget, but as the script developed, the budget grew.
The budget's big, but there's a big story too.
However, 100 million people should become involved in the film, because each angle and effects are so expensive.
Now everything has been bent so tight, there's no finding at all.
Today, Iron Sky Universe, a film production company, launched a public finance campaign and a public loan, with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and offer during the campaign.
At least two years later, the company will pay back the loan.
In the film, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov play.
Train or cool?
Big logos coming back to the shirts
The breasts of trends have recently been cleaned by large logos.
Still some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs in a cognac.
The advertising of the mark of the hood or t-shirt was seen somewhat as a train.
It's the times that change.
Sport has become the right megatrend of fashion, and so are the old, familiar sports characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness waver.
And, like so often before, the funny and trendy limit is disgusting: if something's already got a good one, it's starting to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm Core, or tavismoo, where trenders were surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from mass.
Now, instead of the grey basic collection, we're gonna put on the vervain buried at the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer's logo is in front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas, for example, has identified track curtainrs, favorite team gaming shirts, and New York Yankees flags have made their way back into street fashion.
The start of the farm edge mocking the beginners of Calvin Klein logos is now cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from sports tags to luxury brands.
For example, the breast of Versace’s corset makes clear what character of the clothing it is.
Would you be willing to introduce the logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I didn’t get stuck for hours in the tank’s hatch!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagili, where Russia's Arms Expo 2015.
In recent days, there have been colorful claims on the Russian media that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove the large size of Zotovia from the tanking hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook page a picture of how he seems to permeate the hatch of the tank vehicle in a very good mood and not, at least, based on those images, it's all about being stuck or getting angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the tanks, it was BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel. I've served at Ural.
I went inside, I looked around, and I came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov, the Russian army's TV channel, explained at the exhibition that he wanted Russia's new technology because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriages. I was interested in our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next exhibition, I'm definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the armored wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called upon the writer who wrote it to be a fool.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photo of the alleged imprisonment has been published, even though 50 000 people attended the weapons exhibition during a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with the Bloknot.ru site case, where Zotov was told to get out of the tank hatch when he tried and threatened to shoot everyone around him, unless he could get out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article where the organisers of the exhibition reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his great size, simply stayed while he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said Alexander Pisarevski to Bloknot, the coordinator of the exhibition.

The Agnico Eagle Finland Mine of Canadian-owned mining company has been leaking.
The process water purified in the gold mine has flowed from the so-called wealth of sand to its stream.
According to the company, measures to correct the bleeding have started.
There is a foaming process with neutralised enriched sand and purified process water.
In general, water is either re-used as process water or managed in accordance with the authorisation via the surface area through the environment.
The bleeding was estimated at approximately 300 cubic meters per hour when observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leakwater meets the current permit conditions.
It's the only thing that's ever flown into the environment.
The bleeding was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the dam structures of the pool has been observed.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danske Kuoppamä: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish report published by the IMF today follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization has patented structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing over-employment benefits and paid leave would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole system of agreements and for the security of unemployment.
According to Danske Bank's main economist Pasi Kuoppatmäe, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there are a lot of useful messages for government action, but on the other hand there is also a warning about what should not be too much to cut.
These include infrastructure investments, for example, Kuoppamaki says to the Economy.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be carried out in a timescale as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF foresees an economic growth rate of 0.4% in Finland for this year, which will increase to 0.9% next year.
Danske's prediction today in his new business forecast that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is slightly more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing in the summer, says Kuoppamaki.
Less attention has been paid to the impaired confidence in industry or other so-called softer measures.
However, the differences only concern a few per cent of decimals.
The dying Nintendo appointed a new leader
In July, the Tatsumi Kimishima, who was working under the Iwata cancer, started her work on Wednesday, told Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led the Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic with the face of the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii console launch.
A 65-year-old Kimishima choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to take Nintendo into play, but not to eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles.
More and more minors are arriving in Finland alone asylum seekers
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country would disappear annually.
For example, SVT.se and Dagens Nyhetter have reported on their website that hundreds of minors are lost annually in the country, according to the Swedish Immigration Service.
Jõha Kannelmaa, Senior Auditor of the Finnish Immigration Service, reports on the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear in the year?- In 2013 a total of 156 applications were made for asylum among minors who came alone.
They're gone. They're gone.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11, Kannelmaa reports missing.
The result of the disappearance may be that it is clear from the hearing that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been found to be full-time there.
In that case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue handling the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were made for the reason that the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the amount of growth going on?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors who have become alone.
The total statistics for minors who have been missing this year are not yet available, but the number of applicants of minors is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of persons lost.
What happens to those who have a conversion decision?
Are they also disappearing, for example, for the blind people in the labour market?
This is difficult to assess by the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the return decisions.
Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered people.
He has taken action on this matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who had considered the issues of refugees at the EU's interministerial meeting, reported practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A studio online - see pictures of devices
The equipment used for Timo T.A. Mikkosen's TV and radio productions is now available for sale because of medical incidents in the media sector, which has lost their working capacity.
Mikkkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells in Huuto.net equipment which once became one of the most advanced professionals in the industry.
The first one on the Internet reported was Iltamacasin.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the legs of technological progress.
In the digital media world, TV programs for Betacam are no longer described.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested people will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but it is necessary as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and self - studio builders, Nina Mikkonen thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from his current Myrskylä home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've started to invent and see where things are going.
This is what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no longer any use for TV or radio.
It's clear from the evidence that a man who's made a long career doesn't return to work anymore.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold now.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's actual life work was archived in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited the box shop with films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic is threatening to get a lot worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday.
Metro and track drivers are deciding today whether to expand their efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration of mind.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram transport only during the period of demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, you'll find a way to make sure that the traffic stops all day.
Mr. Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is big on the field.
Night-and-wire cuts make the drivers a lot of noise, so the government plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
However, the monster wonders that the shutdown of traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and track wagons stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is practically almost completely stopped.
According to VR's data, trains do not travel between 6 a.m. on Friday morning and evening.
There's no passing or remote traffic on Friday.
The trains leaving before dawn are driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, the majority of the buses are left on the screen.
The members of the ACP are absent from work on Friday mornings from 3:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. on Saturday morning.
A small number of buses are likely to be driven; they are driven by superior forces, according to HSL's informant Pirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL is unable to tell us exactly which bus shifts will take place on Friday.
Wage and salary organisations organise a major exhibition at the Helsinki Rautatientor on Friday 11-13 p.m.
Aftonbladt: Hungarian police used tears gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used waterfalls against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, the teacher thought he was a bomb of a self-made watch.
In the United States, Ahmed Mohammed, 14 years old, has been arrested after his teacher considered himself to be a bomb on his own.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted only to present his electronic hardware for output.
But one of the teachers thought the bell looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being taken to the youth arrest cell in handcuffs.
Mohammed has never been found to have claimed anything else than that he had made the clock.
Still, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of doing the wrong thing.
Mohammed said the cops said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is kept by the police, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital screen between which there were leaders.
Last Monday, the case happened and Mohamedia was punished with three days of coercion from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Ilmland Council in the country wonders if the case is another evidence of Islamophobia in the United States.
British - Labour leader refused to sing national songs
In the song God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn has also joined with its own Labour Party representatives.
This has hurt the people, thought the Labour nationalist Kate Green, in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s Memorial was honoured for the battle of British Air Force pilots against Germany’s Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and stresses his respect for pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) was respectfully silent during the national song, and the opinion was emphasised.
Corbyn's choice of party leader has divided the Labouri lines.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will dispel moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral armed repression, the cessation of savings and the increase in public expenditure.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn will be present in Parliament as Head of Party during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron was a party leader on Twitter during the weekend.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister referred it to his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear... about the father of the family waiting for the case.
The South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating the family death in Minnesota Greenwood a week ago.
The five-man family was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
First after he shot his wife in the shotgun and three of her children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead days already
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house for inspection and found a huge house on various sides as the Short family's dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million houses and a successful company
The investigation of the South Lake Mintoonka Police Chief Michael Siar is still ongoing.
The motive for blood transfusions is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site for nurses AllNurses.com.
In 2014 StarTribunen interview Short told us that there are four million different visitors per week.
I've been offered 50 purchases for the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a business, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that in 2011 the Short family bought a hulppe house with $2 million from Greenwood.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as a car collector’s dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also an garage sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the family's father was waiting for a case.
Achieveve Test Prep, offering different presiding courses, had sued him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there were no pre-prepping comments on the website, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loir offered you the cake coffee.
In addition, the owner's three prizes were awarded at the food event with the Finnish Hippos month horse owners.
It's great. Loiri's admiring his honour table.
The celebrated Fabrace Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the great competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the gymnastic coach of the horse gets a full job peace when working with the horse.
It's up to the chef to decide where the horse is going to be taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Loiri's laugh.
"The greatest donation ever made by a athlete"
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the medical information, this is the largest ever-time donation made by a athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other funds for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal worth $72 million a year ago with the Canadiens.
So Subban's donation amount is significantly higher than his $9 million years.
To pay for his donation, Subban will receive his name from the hospital a lobby space.
The Canadiens players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
One year ago, the long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a large amount of money for another city’s large hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese coffee shop for the night... -...and serve just a bikini and an essay on her.
The theme coffees are a tough story in Japan.
The markets already have a goat coffee shop, a canned coffee shop, a vampire coffee shop, a coffee shop, and now a wife's coffee shop.
It hits lonely, social, and hungry.
It's the Metro news.
From Tokyo, Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee can be ordered by a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress who pretends to be a client's spouse.
The half is selected from the list before the coffee shop comes, and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is facing only the essay and the bikini on her, while the husband is back in tight wheelchairs.
The web site offers a wife’s doctor all the information about length and weight to what type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: cars' attacks against security began to be equipped
The Automobile Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in this area, as explained in the Communication published by Intel.
The Board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of cybersecurity best practice.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the ASRB findings.
The International ICT research and consultation firm Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles are connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and distribute online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, director of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cyber safety is an important element in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car starts to have a view in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that his car world views are at Frankfurt's auto exhibition.
Thanks to Ford's new four-wheeled RS, 2,3-litre, 350-hevy engine, it's got 4,7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speed with 266 kilometers per hour.
There is also a price of interest in Finland, which is indicatively estimated at EUR 52 000.
The car is now available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not tell when they are informed.
The favourite brand Kia presented two news at the Frankfurt auto exhibition - such is the new Sportage and Optima
A new generation of Sportage, which is likely to catch a larger wing of the ever-growing nuclear nuclear market, will be more important than two new ones in Finland.
The Sportage created by Gregory Guillaume, a new European design director, is more circular than ever.
The distance between the battery and the external dimension is one cent over here, and the car is cutting air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially the same, but has been added to a 1.6-litre turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and more about consumption are reported below sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, because we will have a new Sportage coming in in spring 2016.
Even before a year's change, we have new Kia Optimats.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of upper middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Initially, Optims are obtained with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
In the same time with its arrival, the sale of Optima Farm will begin.
Chisu returned to the stage, smuggled in a brave haalarias.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a visible, open neck hole in the electric pants suit.
The place is a beautiful display of the siron waist of the singer's star.
The whole is crowned with golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three - year break, the mother - in - law singer has been deprived of the pounds of pregnancy by light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to last a year.
The singer published his first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really excited to get back on stage and get up in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed everything about music, the singer tells me.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will publish his new album, together with its fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people can find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's mother-in-law's mother-in-law is starting to suffocate again. Now, I see the chest.
A real-time beauty Kim Kardashia gives a theme for one after another.
He shows his pregnancy jacket and breast-feeding freely in sexy clothes, last night at one American time, when he left his sister Kourtney Kardashian and husband Kanye West's show.
The black motherhood dress is transparent from the front.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress in the flash of lightning.
Last time, Kardashia dressed up as an American motherhood when she visited her friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
Assetta stressed the black over-poln boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week's Friday, when she had a pregnancy jacket on her presentation.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary about the Spying Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about a clean model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six strong truths from Leloup.
Every season starts out empty.
Even if during the previous season you would have been in top designer costumes, the new season will begin again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete for works with frogs.
These models rarely have places to call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take place a year in such a way that there is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses can house their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be intolerablely difficult.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one sort of thinness.
Agent New York may ask for pounds to drop, but then they say you're too thin in Paris.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Design models and designers are together all the time, while operating as a support network.
When the fashion lines stop, the difference's a good one.
The models want this sector, because of the opportunities it offers, but they are missed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is only about showing clothing.
The models also want to be their own.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors with some kind of role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
You were modeling at Tory Burch's show last night.
New York is currently having fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their collection next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, plays an unidentified Abilanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala as the founder member of the band in the movie based on the early years of the Apulanta Association.
It was founded by Apulanda in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but it resigned in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the right Antti before the shoots, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I just learn her play style from the video.
I don't want to make a impression of a human being.
A man who trusts the Roope Salminen and the Dogs team just empty doesn't go into the roles.
The punk maner comes with him naturally.
During the punk period of the stars, stars, many people must have seen the taste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our presence has never been anything small, but we always go full.
In the aid of 1993-2004 the main actors of the Tuukka Temos film, led by Tuukka Temos, were announced today.
A nuclear force known to the audience in the band is being presented by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki plays Teppo Manner, singer from Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about his future washing yesterday evening when he told him that he was mysteriously preparing his career for the most important day.
Roope has already published on Instagram yesterday a picture of his new story, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, who was seen earlier in the box and in the pantry, has shaved his face as silopos, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist counsels: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees who are seeking a Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about at all?
It doesn't have to be talked about, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting younger children, and for example does not allow them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay round and be agitated, he says.
However, if a child has encountered or heard from refugees on TV news, it is worth speaking about.
It is good to have a conversation about the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You don't have to be afraid of the charge, even if you're bullying yourself and you're scared.
A younger child is closely following the conduct of his parents.
If parents themselves stay calm during the conversation, the child too will feel safe.
The older children are likely to encounter a debate on refugees in school, with friends, or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them about it if they think about it.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can meditate on how our family feels about this.
At the end of the day, though, do we feel that the world is safe or safe?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety, as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child is given a model of how to deal with the problems ahead of life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
You're out of your own power?
But you can still be a good parent to your child.
Severe control of the bleeding Pallosalama
Perttu Pohjola was able to climb into the dark middle of the attack in the Appola Pallosalama.
It only broke profits and second graders until the end of July in Tampere's raves came to collapse.
As the slave first jumped, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered his child to stay safe from the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the report.
The horse had an infection of the throat.
The disease wasn't the least of its problems, but the debilitating of it required two courses of medicine.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be light on the move, Pohjola says he is pleased with the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku at its record time after the second SE-mama Taruntule.
Apilan Pallosalama was under very much pressure when it could only have been driving for a few weeks.
Those things in view of the small bending at the end were understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good race made the Ori steel.
The horse’s flow must have moved on from it, and I hope that it would also be even more balanced.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called sense of humor.
When you haven't had a good time, you could throw fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have removed such a flashbook that the opponents have been amazed.
At steady speed, the turtles will not be able to reach Pallosala, even with warm - blooded rides.
There's a pageant in Vermo's hopes.
However, there is a difference as to how Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might just fall under the car's boom and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave would be calmer than Turku's leaving.
When Apilan Pallosalama is in good shape, we can also come from the bow, and we will go out to win with it, the coach's permission.
That's why you can't get rid of the useless iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, explains Tim Cook Buzzfeed during an interview with the CEO of the company.
Apple’s iPhone contains a series of programs that are relatively rarely used: for example FaceTime calls, Journalists, Health, Exchanges, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as an forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple’s iPhone applications worked closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So according to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company does not want to waste memory on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1% year-on-year, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by the reduction in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised a slightly downward estimate of 0.2% of the budget of a few weeks ago.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
In August, the so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the whole of the 28 EU countries was zero in August.
The rise in July was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most in the euro area, i.e. by 1.4 per cent in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest in price reductions by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium term.
On average, the ECB predicts inflation of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
The next year will increase to 1.1%, with the central bank forecasting in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The United States Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The next U.S. recession starts at its fastest in less than a year, but most certainly within three years after Fed takes a long time to raise its interest rates.
And in the financial markets, the submergence begins before the next recession.
Fed has indicated that he might have started the interest payments this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
As a result, the next recession can be hit at its fastest by next autumn and in the form of a financial market exchange rate before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they've been doing, and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's finances as they have done before.
Such conclusions have led to the conclusion that the German bank Deutsche Bank's market research strategies in London, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, in their extensive long-term market and economic research.
The bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international major customers last week.
The strategies that drew up the study and the report do not believe they are aware of when exactly Fed will begin to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market afterwards.
Instead, they present with cool facts and calculations of economic statistics how the economy and the market have previously behaved during and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they look at the key factors of the economy and financial markets, which are now, or are, the same model as in past interest rates - and possibly the result thereof.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a higher state than once in the 1950s.
Maybe not a year before the beginning of the recession.
Fed's monetary policy, and its current impetus, the leaders who have decided over the past summer and the early heart have suggested that time is beginning to be mature to raise interest rates.
For more than nine years, the first interest rate may be due this week.
This matter will be settled in the middle of the week and Thursday when the so-called open market committee of the Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised his so-called Fed funds guidance interest rate in June 2006.
At the end of the two-year period, a relatively regular, but at a time, a small,25 percentage point interest rate series ended, with Fed raising its interest from 1,25 % to 5,25 %.
In 2007, the financial market's symptom began to suffer from the difficulties of the most high-risk housing financing in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis was torn into a global day of judgment.
The major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy failures started to slower than have been typically since earlier Fed's interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and worse than once in the 1930s.
Deutsche strategies have been screening the increase and fall of the largest economies in the world, as well as the financial market turn since 1950, and in places from the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact are being clarified since the 1950s.
The first withdrawal period has been less than one year, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended in the course of the year-to-year period from the start of Fed's interest rates.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, Fed has increased and reduced its steering interest rate by a dozen different cycles.
Each time, there has been a difference between others, and there is a relatively limited number of times in the review, so it is unlikely that there will be any certainty about the impact of the next interest rates.
The strategies point out that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Rates too low for too long
The critical reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be undisputed by decades of research.
But three points of the crisis, and for the reasons that have increased its destructive power, must be somewhat undisputed:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other largest central banks in the world considered their steering interest rates to be too long too low.
They were placing traces of the technology, and at the same time they raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the rise in the different parts of the financial and real economy, and the debt ratio already too high, increased from the monetary policy of the central banks to the greater extent.
So far, the largest debt bubble in the history of the economy was born.
3) Especially in the financial sector, the most frequently offered mad-down debt financing hit most of the financial market sectors by the highest exchange rates in the economic history of the past on shares in real estate, debt securities and commodities.
Also, it is unlikely that it will be difficult to argue that the financial markets that have risen to heights in the form of increasingly complex debt instruments were in a rare dangerous and unstable divided position when Fed and other central banks last drove up the interest rates.
The financial structure of debt instruments could not last as long as the valuation scales had started after the interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Greater bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of nuclearisation by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now held their monetary policy on even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) In the long term, debt has not been madly cheap as it was ten years ago, but debt money is now, at its worst, literally cheaper than it is to express.
As a result, the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, debt has become more difficult than the debt burden before or before the financial crisis.
3) The majority of the liquidity that has been issued out of the previous quarter and lower than the central banks has fallen into the financial market and the main types of securities and assets have become most expensive since the peak preceding the financial crisis or ever.
Furthermore, not only the financial market warning marks, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and from the most serious recession in decades to the model of the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but according to the pressures and risks on the financial markets are much higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed is now starting to tighten up its money.
Perhaps the future image of the French bank's Societe Generale strategy, Albert Edwards, is not as strange as it suddenly might seem.
He has been training the Bank’s international investors for the following full translations:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the cash flow will come out, and soon, it's time Fedin was going to push off the financial cuts with even bigger QE cash payments.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) who makes computers and printers will reduce up to 330,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at the company service side of HP, the company tells.
In November, HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., a company focusing on pc machines and printers for consumers.
The maximum number of HP staff in 2011 was 350000.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 30,000.
The company records one-off expenses of $ 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25,000 employees.
The consumer's reductions will remain at 3300 in three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that it has balanced its business so that none of its customers anymore account for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the second year, 65 per cent of the operating income was generated by its three most important customers.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system after Apple update
A new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings application, by clicking on the "General" and then selecting the "Profit Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you an option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation after the show has been shown to be a "Processation Update failed" error message.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to get the space, but Apple has reduced this option by reducing the size of the update and also making the process easier with a new tool that proposes removable applications and then re-mount them when the update is completed.
It is worth making sure that the phone is charged or close to the charger during the update that the battery does not stop.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery stops in the middle, it may lead to an update breach.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of a tax haven company
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the government of the tax haven company.
Ylen stated that the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo, appointed as a member of the Board of Directors, Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself says that he left a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough I've filed a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, says Berner at Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the ownership of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a car park manufacturer which merged with Karelia-upofloor, Finnish car park manufacturer in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia Upofloor government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Government and in the Luxembourg company.
According to Ylen, Kährs’ holdings in Luxembourg are carried out through a multi-portal ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a government membership at the Luxembourg company Kährs' second largest owner's request.
This is the owner of Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia Upofloor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partnership was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital income is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that there is no tax planning for Hartwall Capital's property in the company.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' capital fund Triton already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre run by the company
In Espoo, Otaniemi, the first reception centre operated by the company is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from this evening.
The number of places can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the building of the former Rescue College.
Luona Oy is a company that is active in the production of health care and health care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the Centre’s security arrangements.
STKT prepares alternative work pressure package
STKT is about to prepare an alternative package for the tensions of the government's working life.
The organisation also hopes that other wage-tier central organisations will be included.
According to President Antti Palola, today attention is in the light of Friday.
Alternative means to reduce the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone appreciates that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out on a break from the organization’s administrative meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the European Union for Economic and Social Affairs (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The Economists of STK have calculated that the security of change contained in the Government's Competitiveness Package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if the party has a terrible passion for having a conversation if there's one relationship with 100.
Palola: The consultation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (cent.) has asked for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to provide a communication of its own package to Parliament and start working on reforms.
Palola did not take the view on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the discussion of the government exists and has been constructive to him all the time.
According to Palola, an operation on Sundays is a painful place.
The organisation requires the government to retreat from coercive legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STKT, Palola does not allow an alternative package to be prepared with SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday to Helsinki to oppose the work pressure package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the first days of sickness are cut, the over-work benefit is halved, the Sunday allowance is reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
STKT emphasises that the central organisations have called employees to the protest, and that there has been no intention of strike.
The plan's Fjäder thanking you
The plan president, Mr Fjäder, congratulates the STKT on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STKT is now coming to the same lines as Akaka, because there is already a longer-defined alternative model for government presentations in Akaka.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK package it is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The plan president, Mr. Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK led by Lauri Lylyn will come forward to prepare the presentation as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola STKT said earlier Wednesday that she was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it has long prepared its own proposal, which is ready to negotiate the 5 % level of competitiveness pursued by the government as an alternative to cuts.
The scheme has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have been writing an alternative model for government presentations for a long time.
We are ready to look at the terms of service as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akva’s lines, as STKT has previously done on Wednesday.
Without SAS, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday 15 a.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.

The prime ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Ylen on Wednesday night at 21.05 p.m.
When applying for the previous Prime Minister's speech, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister in holding the famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers held several radio calls during the winter and further wars.
In the 1990s, instead of President Mauno Koivisto, Esko Aho gave the speech of the New Year, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen closed the train crew strike on television.
Alone, monarchist makeup
The sound of a pig has been raising all day's criticisms and guessions about what I'm going to have to say.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the left-wing movement, said on Twitter that "The Sipilä could speak on the status of the nation as a Prime Minister's announcement, which would allow the speech to be discussed as well".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "one voice has already been seen.
The leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP's Erkki Judges condemned that "monarchist makeup: the Prime Minister will tell the people what's best for it".
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "A few and a half years from the elections.
Not just a prime minister on the media with an opposition.
It's been tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts for about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented on in direct mail by the Chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and Jyri Häkäminen, CEO of the EC.
Yle has been criticised for making Sipila's speech.
We considered this and said that it was part of the public service task to promote comprehensive public access in Finland, the director of Yle's publications in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle.
It's like we're in Tammelos' time.
The speech has also been raised by the smiles.
The dinner that comes in the evening is enjoyed in good time, the kids are combed and put on their best.
Mom put on a nicest plunger, and Dad settles his tie with his neck.
At nine o'clock, it's slowing down to TV like before I used to be in the Tammeloos time," writes the blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also state in his speech why the Finnish Government is sitting in the tax havens of millions of hidden capitals, who make laws of pardon for other tax reptiles and, at the same time, claim to the people that they have to operate when the state is out of the money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
For what Sipilä says, one guess presents the University of Tampere's Green Leftman Viva.
It's been released on Facebook by a bingo over there.
Do we hear of the same boat, the same carbon, the living and the team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are finished, it starts at 21.05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisar in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to withdraw Al Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up his power, says President Martti Ahtisari Guardian.
According to the Ahti Island, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan that would have been elegantly out of power after some time.
However, the Western countries did not meet the proposal because they thought al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Mr Ahtizar discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaare, in a bilateral debate, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed him three points of the plan: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and al-Assad had to be slowed down.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all these matters, but we will be able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down with Alaska, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtizar will remember during an interview with Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtizar reports that Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate, but according to Ahti Island there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on the claims made by the Ahtisaare, but said that the Al Assad forces had already committed a number of massacres at that time, and the key opposition groups refused all agreements in which they would have gone to power.
According to his experience, Russia was never prepared to discuss Al-Assad's fate.
Officially, Russia has supported Al Assad throughout the war.
The point that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate is to argue with the Ahtisaare.
If she had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that Putin's spear would have held power on some Al Assad supporter.
The refugee flow into our own actions
During the negotiations on the Ahti Island, some 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
Over 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes for war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own.
I don't see any choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill we made ourselves, Ahtizar says to the press.
Asylum applicant organisation centre with anthrax in Tornio
An asylum centre designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the building of the Tornio jointation building empty in the city centre.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better control the refugee flows from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsinki Sanomat announced that the Bureau had already decided to present the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Höppinen, the Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, it is not true.
When the entire delegation was not assembled and some of the people wanted to have a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he would specify it to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43.
The organisation centre was opposed to 13 delegates.
On that basis, the decision could be expected to be positive, says Höppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received no contact on Monday, and a rapid reaction was made.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred yards from the border, so that would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
There is still a desire for a job market option for blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (cent.), half of the public holiday payments would only take part in the calculation of the price of work pursued by the government.
However, the government is happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners can agree on such an option.
Sipilä told the editors in the Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for compensatory means for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement comes into existence, we will, of course, be happy to accept it as part of the overall package.
The half-life of the holidays in Sipila would be a means of working, since it would be directed at almost all employees, unlike, for example, the surgery of Sundays envisaged by the government.
Labour organisations could agree on cutting holiday money, because they are registered in collective agreements rather than law.
On Wednesday next week, the Government will present these views to Parliament on the challenges of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to the hat, the organisations' proposals should be aware of this before.
This is not the final back line either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train is on the move, and it will become more and more difficult.
We've got a lot of time.
After all, it will not take long to deal with such matters if there is a will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published last week by the government includes, for example, the conversion of the stealth and helatorista into unpaid days without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first days of sickness is cut, over-work benefits are halved, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as coercion legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
Wage and salary organisations organise a major promotion on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärve's council approved the extension of the juice grey warehouse
The Tohmajärve Council approved unanimously but a slight expansion of the stocks of Nordic Koivu Oy’s hall, i.e. the juice hall.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than it had been originally spoken.
A busy schedule, too.
It was also a little wonder that the need for order was not known a year ago when a decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, the extension of the stock of 400-450 square metres was approved in the Investment Plan, but the financing will be decided more frequently in the context of the Interim Report.
The agenda was still talking about investing between EUR 150 000 and 200 000, but Erkki Iconen, Technical Director at the meeting, said that it would amount to an estimated EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the local community.
The company pays for the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (ps.) was justified.
The Karelian language even has its place in Joensuu
The city government reduced its earlier steep position to bring the Latvian street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the election of the cattle tradition throughout the county.
Joensuu does not declare it the capital of the livestock language, because it has no historical basis, nor is it an inherent part of the identity of the territory.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region is more of an Eastern Savoy.
After a new decision, there will be no street name signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, prepared to use the cattle language, for example, in the information tables and the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude of the city recommends all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single - language municipality, it is also worth taking an open attitude to the use of the livestock language now that multiculturalism is living and is rapidly changing in Northern Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still specific features of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole forest capital city of Finland.
Both of them can benefit from a wide range of marketing activities in the region.
The closures of the trains will cut the vitality of the county
The operation of the trains will impact the vitality of the county with a strong hand.
Transport links directly affect the business and competitiveness of the region.
And that affects whether or not you can live and work here at all, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points out air transport, which has been on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the country as a whole that we should not be able to reduce our possibilities by means of government measures, as is the case now.
The effects of the closures of these transport links on employment, for example, are to be considered by the Karjalainen.
The deterioration of transport connections leads to an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier to get students and employees, says Director Jukka Mönkkönen of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that bad traffic connections also affect the faculty, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
The Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already the marketing of the University towards Western Finland is difficult, as traffic connections are weak in the lateral direction.
At present, about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, around 10-20 percent of them are from the new world, which is partly explained by a direct connection to the train.
Joensuu became one of my ringtones for Siu's war.
The view of the City Government of Joensuu on the regional Siu sote project is apparently unanimous, but one among the sounds.
Mr Pentti Kesso (sd., in the picture) presented the whole project to be abandoned at the government meeting on Monday, but his presentation collapsed unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed before the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
The passenger transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one pair of trains is less frequent.
There will be changes in passenger trains between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of train passes away, but still five times a day gets to Kotka Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to state savings.
The purchase of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely cut off.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped from the place.
The rescue facility let a 12-year-old climb on the roof, who couldn't help himself down the roof.
The situation occurred on the Tornion Hill in Ketotie at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two - story wooden house where there are no ladders on the roof at all.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the house to the roof along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same path, but one didn't.
The result was that others drifted from the place and the passers alarmed the rescue facility to help the latter safely back to the surface.
FedEx's operating profit is twofold, falling into the tax year's outlook for 2016
FedEx reported massive results in the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its entire year's output forecast, due to the reduced demand for freight services and the higher costs of its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
During this time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening hours of the week.
FedEx Corp. says that next May it expects the end of the tax year to be 10.40-10.90 dollars, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10,84, reported in FactSet's survey.
Despite the price increases of 4,9 % on average, which take effect on 4 January, the smaller outlooks came, and despite the higher charges that began in November for land transport in heavy or large packages.
The company said that it expected an increasing net profit from the previous year, as they cut expenses, the net sales have increased and the online store is growing.
The president and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "has a strong focus, taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, particularly in production and worldwide trade".
Planned salaries for holidays were announced the day after the competitor UPS told us that he was going to hire between 90 and 95 000 extra workers, about the same as it paid last year.
In the fourth quarter of August ending 31st, FedEx’s profit was 692 million dollars, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The winning per share came to $2.42, which is left with a $2.44 average prediction. 12 analyst surveys carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
At Zacks' survey, six analysts were waiting for $12,23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered a reduction in international priority transport, which has stopped the development of its Express unit turnover.
However, the rise in online trade has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but in principle the revenues of the activities were the same as for the costly costs of larger packages and for their own insurance.
Express's income was better due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight was reduced by higher labour costs.
At the opening call, about an hour before the opening session, FedEx's shares dropped to $3.85, or 2.5 per cent to $15.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent in bill for this year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
The decision-makers of the U.S. Central Bank will sit two days this week in a long-awaited meeting around a huge mahogany table, deciding whether the time has come for the first time to raise the control interest rate to almost a decade.
The two-storey meeting rooms are a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and her colleagues must put the financial interests of the nation ahead of all else.
The Congress has laid down two different responsibilities for the central bank's shoulders: they should maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the large recession, the Governors of the Central Bank have agreed that there is also a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This is precisely the third requirement that a decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot be predicted, and whether the US economy is prepared for the record-making incentive, which has been brought about by the short-term interest rate that has remained almost zero since the end of 2008 .
Although the majority of the data show a steady growth of the economy, the recent death on the global financial markets may have made it even more frightful for the former pre-existing central bank officials to increase instability, which is feared to have an impact if the federal Funds Rate reference value was raised in the fourth quarter of the unit.
"The labour market and inflation are clearly the first and most important factors to be monitored", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for the recovery of interest rates, the increased uncertainty on the world market is still a valid enough basis," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been reached in agreement, which has already led to an alarming economic activity.
According to Bloomberg's recent study, about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the increase, as the central indicator shows that it is only around 30% of the growth potential.
This refers to the fall in the securities market if the central bank does not raise the level unless the decision-makers would then be able to soften the attack by promise that the next raise will not take place in the near future.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index increased 228.89 points, which is 1.4 per cent, while the new figure was 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would keep the level unchanged this week, explains the main economic expert in the John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raise interest rates right now," he says.
If decision-makers raise interest rates, "they need to see a lot of effort in their policies to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm the financial market, since it would eliminate the uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter unit in this month, taking the first small step towards slow consolidation of the monetary economy, which would confirm the stability of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has said in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals demand more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
In the last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level considered by the central bank as the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of fragmentation.
Although inflation remains below the ECB’s 2 % annual target, the central bank’s decision-makers believe that access to this is a temporary effect of a significantly reduced oil price.
The economy "to solve even higher interest rates and also to take account of the strict situation on the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were upset last week when China developed its currencies.
The Dow Jones industrial average index decreased by up to 16 per cent of its May record, while investors were afraid that China's slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak figure.
For central bank decision-makers, market mellerry is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells us that interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and the recent weeks' news of the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision-makers would strengthen the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Olier, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision makers wait at least one month to gain a better understanding of the impact.
"The potential effects on the US economy are still very unclear, and they have little information on what will happen in China," Oliner says.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so it should not, in principle, affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the current President, Ben S. Bernanken, suggested that the central bank could "specify" the amount of money, caused a mess in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, central bank officials are expected not only to develop further, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of Envestnet Inc.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) of the state of Virginia, Jeffrey Lacker, pointed out this month that "the Central Bank has previously over-registered its financial markets, which have seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy".
The Federal Open Market Committee that takes decisions has called for an increase in interest rates, and Mr Lacker, a member of the Committee's voting rights, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0,75 percentage points during the three meetings "regardless of its limited, identifiable effects on U.S. economic growth", says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank canceled these cuts.
The Central Bank should give priority to economic stability only during the great crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the interest-setting committee of the Bank of England.
The latest myllerys does not come near its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to be in a situation where the rise in interest rates is feared because the market is becoming more difficult", Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to contain a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I do not think that it should be anticipated.
You miss a great Thai store?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.

Rio Grande, Brazil’s Child Disease Association advertises healthy diets for mammals
The Brazilian Child Disease Organization SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to understand the significance of good food during breast feeding by publishing images of babies with breasts that are painted for unfair food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide all the nutrients needed for babies to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Medicine revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an abnormal diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is one of the favorite viewers, despite Nine-channel companies to news about the management of Today Show program
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's attack on Canberra's news of the successors of the Liberal Party's leadership failed to increase the number of viewers in Today.
The morning program of the Nine Channel was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull shut down Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, which David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week’s series of international broadcasts, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance bus did not seem to be damaging to Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise's average viewer was 397 000 in five state capitals, while Today was 339 000.
The average of Today rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000) but still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the average of Today was 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, in September, Sunrise has a average of 349 000 viewers, with a total of 314 000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing all morning.
This morning, the winds are blowing away from Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 word series, where the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which collected a relatively impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have wondered if Thomson would be the driving force of a popular series alone without Rebecca Gibney as the Rafthers star.
Last night's results gave us real certainty.
Seven-channel The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, winning the Block series (838 000) and TBL Facilities (726 000).
Seven had two fates on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half-tunt programme (17-17.30) collected 446 000 viewers on the central wall.
Another semi-student (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers - a small enough victory for the Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat programme (613 000).
On Monday night, the Chase Australia’s first half hour viewer averaged 520 000 viewers and the second half hour was 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia’s second-night decrease brings Nine channel confidence that the Hot Set will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program which failed to reduce the number of viewers in McGuire.

The final threes agree with Daddy that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who wins The Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret, with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we talked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeavos-Fellows, the day before the three became two, they could deliberately give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women became poetic when they told us how Wood was the perfect man to mention his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness as a reason why they would like to be his partner.
But when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should go?", their answers could offer a discovery of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay's best option to Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been complicated since the first day.
"From that moment on when I walked in the house (Sarah) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," said Jeavos-Fellows.
"Sarah's really close, and it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would make a very good partner.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be the right one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that obviously this isn't just a game - I'm with all my heart here," he said.
When you ask who Wood should choose, if not her, Mackay was worthy.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in his transformation to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about him since his impressive open-air training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne on the exchange bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugbylia turn-off dropped the ball in the first take-off when they returned to the team when they won Minnesota on Tuesday, as we read in 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and gave Hayne to return the next flight shot and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real character of Tomsula was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of barking up his new entrants as a pottery in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special editor Cam Inman reports that Haynea also encouraged the coordinator of special teams, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the plane blow that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game
This really wasn't the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished for the man NFL-debyy.
Hayne was seen on his way from the field after the drop, and later he told Hamish & Andy about the Australian radio station at 2DayFM at a distance of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It's just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and it's in it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her bearding with her 2007 Origin debut when the feed in her own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted his Instagram account to publish a photo with fans while holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun on the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was imprisoned, and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 died at the police shooting of rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal, after a police officer shot up in a mob that pointed out the country's new constitutional proposal, told the authorities Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandu.
Commissioner Bishop Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police were using the tear gas and then shot him in the air before he got into rubber bags.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why the rubberoids, which are known to have been killed, but which are traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to cause so many deaths.
In recent weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, the members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new Constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own country.
At least 40 people have died in violent conflicts since August 10, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement that divided the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government over the centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the statements in the constitution for the Katmandus, and the authorities have said that the new charter could be approved by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Centre NHC says that on the south side of Cape Verde there is a 60% chance of a hurricane
In the winter at the low pressure front, approximately 560 km south of the southernmost part of Cape Verde’s island group, 60 per cent is the opportunity to develop into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
The second precise low pressure front, located in the middle of Cape Verde's island group and the Little Antilles, also has the opportunity to develop into a tropical hurricane during the next two days, the weather forecast centre in Miami added.
Google starts a donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting $111 million for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees coming to Europe in their escape from war and from poor countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal point of view in its published donation campaign blog.
Instead of making the announcement, the director wrote about his own personal experience with Google’s employee Rita Masoud, who fled with his family from Kabul when he was seven years old.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But once the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Four non-profit organisations help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it would equal the same amount to every donation made worldwide on the google.com/refuguereelief site up to $5,5 million dollars, with a total target of $111 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been going on since World War II, mainly due to the civil war in Syria for four years, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dilution surgery can help with mildly obese diabetes mellitus
According to the new study, the benefit of mildly obese type 2 diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated with surgery.
"It takes a long time to get data on death," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He's a weighting surgery expert who wrote the script on the new research in JAMA Survey magazine.
Dilution or bariatric surgery uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach bag.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects involved in the study have been obese fat and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the BMI is more than 30, it is considered to be obese.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the purpose of this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from 2007 to compare two bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, treatment of type 2 diabetes in humans with mildly obese muscles.
The study showed that the average BMI of the persons cut fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the people who were treated with other means than surgery remained roughly the same in 29.
Of the people who were cut, 36% improved their diabetes, and 28% partially.
Due to the comparison, in the drug-treated group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and partly about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgery group", the writers said.
The investigators also observed blood levels of A1c in patients that reflect long-term blood glucose levels.
The haemoglobin level should remain below 7%; researchers should write.
Following surgery, the A1c level fell from approximately 9% to about 6%.
However, it remained stable in approximately 8% in the group of medicinal products.
However, this improved "glyse control", which is described by improved haemoglobin levels, did not reduce mortality over the last five years, explains the head researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two types of surgery.
During the fifth year, when compared to the gastrointestinal reduction group, the gastrointestinal bypass surgery group had dropped more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 % and 2.1 %), and had more likely achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9 % and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenixin Blackstone says that although research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in the worst people.
In the Swedish study, over-emphasis patients had a 29% lower likelihood of death during the 15-year period when compared to a group that had experimented with more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to improve the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for individuals with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"Students are crucial in demonstrating that surgery is safe for the lower weight index group", and it does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"All cannot come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The head of Buddhism in Tibet has called for the end of violence in refugees' countries.
The current refugee crisis was dealt with by Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of its ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that, although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
"All cannot come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to look after a number of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to think about long-term solutions: how to bring about real peace and real development in these Muslims, mainly through education.
The ultimate point is to consider how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In its position on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States caused serious events in the chain.
"After 9/11 I wrote my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem could be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and created unexpected consequences", Dalai Lama said.
Over the last four years, children's hand-in-hand desinification has increased by fourfold
Poison information centres across the United States have reported a strong increase of nearly 400% in the absorption of alcohol-containing hand-infining agent in children under 12 years of age after 2010, reports Georgia’s Toxicity Data Centre.
According to the director of the Georgia Toxicity Information Centre, Doctor Gaylord Lopez, the cases of swallowing of the disinfection agent reported at the poisoning centres in children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them will have to go to the emergency police," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
YouTube has videos of teenagers drinking disinfecting agents to get a cheap rise.
According to the reports, teenagers have mixed disinfecting substances in alcohol-rich oral water to get a stronger drink.
The scents of a pleasant disinfecting agent can attract younger children.
"The boy doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (manufacturous) are those that have been added to the scent.
There are manic, grape and orange-based disinfecting substances that are very attractive to children.
The alcohol may contain in the hands between 45% and 95%.
Especially in small children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's a really concentrated alcohol," said Stephen Thornton, director of the Health Information Centre in the University of Kansas, Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave whiskey on the table, but the hand-infining agent will be left visible, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhajah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four bruises of mansic product with hand disinfection in school and was taken to first aid for care.
His blood had an alcohol level of .179, which is twice the limit of adult cyclisthood, reports the first aid police doctor Chris Ritchey, who held a girl in Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When talking to your Sam, Nahah could not walk when he arrived at the first aid.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate child hospital for possible brain injury symptoms because alcohol allowed a girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told.
"It was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
It could have been a deadly situation for my baby.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol swabs, as well as moving the disinfecting agent away from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are connected to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died when swallowed with a hand disinfecting agent that included a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and no ethyl alcohol, which had been declared an active ingredient.
In January, in the north of New York State, three fourth graders planned to poison their "bad" teacher by spreading bacteria to the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfecting agent and banned it from his class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a "flexive cheer" and leave disciplinary action on the school circuit.
Humidity: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths doesn't talk about Celtic's conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but she makes it turn.
Hearts fights the Scottish football union against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is equipped with January recruits that may interfere with the unity of the team.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic five points.
Adam Rooney's first half penalty shot took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at the Pittodar Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference to five points in Celtic.
Griffiths evasively speaking about conflicts
There have been rumors about the internal conflicts in Celtic, but Griffiths passed them right away. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under more specific supervision when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think players are waiting to meet up.
The lack of a Scotts championship is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers middle field player and former Dutch country team leader Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with Rangers.
The current ambassador of Ajax de Boer said: "There is no more the highlight of Celtic games in the country, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tensions in these teams' games, and also non-Scotlands want to follow them in the games.
Deila swears to turn around
Ronny Dela has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss is sworn to turn around.
The destruction of Malmöl and its drop from the league of the Masters quickly followed the defeat of ten men in the game Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series five points apart from the next.
Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are well, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we have to go on.
We really need supporters because it improves players' performance.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is equipped with January player transfers
Although Rangers-pomo Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible target of January's players' transfers, he is equipped with the most recruitable to convince him that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, "The window of January is very different from the summer window."
For future players in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire period preceding, which is shown in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic’s interest in living is suggested by Michu
Michu, an attacker of Swansea, who has been linked to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has had a ankle trouble, and during the summer, he failed to find a new company outside Wales.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish football union because of Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and after this the team lost 3-2. The half-man's red card was later revoked, and this was the third red card that Columin condemned in the last eight months.
Nellson will remain behind what he said, saying, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernia player was despicable when he sang an insulting song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pub in Edinburgh Roseburn before Edinburgh's derby at Tynecasle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a moment's lead," the attacker said adding, "It's safe to say that I'm not coming back to Tynecastle unless I move on to Celtic."
The Tannadice Government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United Government still has faith in its leadership ability to turn the situation around, but admit that the decline of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about "the ugly victory" in Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging around in the game against Hamilton Access, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty shot, he managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league, which raised them at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a pocal or too, which would not have won the games in this way too."
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom's total population growth
WORKING in Scotland remained 164,000 in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Great Britain rose by 10,000 people to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK by 5.5 per cent, and the figures in the National Statistical Centre (ONS) are higher.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 over the three-month period, and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average by 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of hugdust is to build the foundations for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I testify to execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, I'll see you later today when a man is executed.
If so, and I hope not, I'll sit on the viewer's press at Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch Richard Glossip executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to feel bad about this day when I approached it.
So why did I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
The suppliers, of course, have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected through a terrible value.
Oklahoma has reduced the media’s places to twelve-five.
Whoever's going to be chosen will watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also created my own connection to him through the calls made over the months and one two-hour and half-hour visits.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and pen with me to record what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, an Octahian journalist accused me of denying my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to do it, and you'll be able to attend.
I was complaining to the reporter.
He admitted that "you could have set your word better", but he still thinks that what I did was wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I'm supposed to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said so.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants us to have an international journalist who's writing about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help in countering the death penalty.
Huffington Post Reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcasts I've made.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would in any case make him guilty.
But I think there's a very strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And this is the angle I look at him die from.
I can't say I'm completely unbiased.
There will be other suppliers who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like die unnecessary.
The man was lured away from the Canning River River after the police station that pulled him off.
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he lured him away from the Canning River River.
A man from Perth's attempt to distract the police from his canoes went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, mud water only about a meter away from a cop who was trying to "screw him gently back to the beach".
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday to Beckenham due to an unauthorized invasion.
When they found the suspect, he was trying to distract them from the Canning River River River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, "I'm not coming out, come get me," told senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to be baptized, so he used safer tactics: "All police conference".
"Sometime people do funny things trying to escape," told senior sergeant Castledine.
The champion football player Ben Cousins is an outstanding example.
In 2006 Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing up and tried to swim across Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired locals to begin the planning of playful Ben Cousinsbythlon.
Peter Moody claims that the players tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria's editors were trying to stifle his deposits last year, and he is threatening to stop competing immediately.
He blames the agents and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tata's late rejection of the treatment on the day of the race was the last thread.
Moody told Fairfax Media that her goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that she has been in a difficult situation after the unexplainable positive cobolt sample in Lidar.
He's been keeping his tongue under control for a year and a half, and he didn't want "it look like envy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it's so frustrated that everything's gonna go off at once," Moody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes all I have to do is react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to head up and I want owners to think that I'm doing my best in front of them.
When they start thinking differently, I don't have to continue as coach anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm gonna do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb on racing.com's website in an interview where he told us that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
"Six months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man... "named him when I asked him, and offered him a job with my deposit box if he cared about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they'd really want to separate their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Modie, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, as well as Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of and are aware of this today.
Should I start thinking this is gonna be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to emigrate and perhaps transfer responsibility to trainers beyond what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that it is possible that what I have said now will not make them think about it.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and it's sad for me.
It really hurts me.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the coach has grown through a long-term Lidar cobolt study, and late rejection led him to find that he could "create his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the training of the undefeated master Black Cavari, has called the competition day care rule "dreamable" after the mud or clay bath has been placed in the legs of a horse which is illegal.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake with a mud on his leg.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been last night, as it was.
It was on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the shark treatment of the competition day, from which the research was initiated by the editors.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
"All of us understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
Arrested by a driver in Cobra
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic offence when he came across a biker this weekend in Cobra.
A biker was transported by flight to Royal Melbourne Hospital after having suffered serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help a injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failing to provide assistance, and of other traffic offences.
A biker, 40-year-old man from Cobram, still in the hospital, and he's stable.
Coach Craig Bellamy of the Melbourne Storm team attacks competitors on the wrestlers
Mr. Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, has criticised the two masters of the NRL-rugbyliga for the fact that his team's tattoos would be part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the Emissarys allowed Storm 'pain' on their side when it suddenly won the finals in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the finals. Bennett invited the game to the rugbyliga's show window and said that the two Queensland teams were not "hardly excited" from the buttons.
Bellamy defended his team's fights and said they were just focusing on "to contact" in the catch.
Bellamy added that her trust added two leading coaching critics against Stormia, because that means they're afraid to lose to the team.
"This is always gonna be a speech... "I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or technologies all year long.
Trent's been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this will always be discussed at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "a exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "right".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the rugby we find exciting, especially when he has high-speed young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have those kind of players.
He brought up that side in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I'm gonna be more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more complicated than the game between the Broncos and the cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the line of defense and not make a goal?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Stormi is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game, either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharps, next Saturday night to the pre-fine at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
The Serbime Man's $200,000 guarantee for a drug charge
A man who is threatened with a possible life-long risk of a 40-knive cocaine holding company in Queensland has been released against the 200 000-dollar guarantee amount.
A 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after a federal police officer traced 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay station, who came to South America through the Old Ageed, and took a shipyard in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other accuseds on the boat all morning, and after that he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Tokyo Echo truck.
Although Maksimovic is threatening the possible life-long business of a cocaine possession company, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire quantity and that he could have been in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has close links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court Wednesday.
In the case of the criminal court, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
The mother and stepfather of Maksimovic had offered together a guarantee of $200,000 to secure her release.
"When I read the oaths of both persons, it is clear that setting up a guarantee of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to stop him from appearing in front of justice, he warned.
The guarantee was granted to Maksimovic on condition that he gave up his passport both Australia and Serbia every day, reporting to the police and holding onto his exit ban between the evening and the morning.
Stepan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles into sending photos.
The pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl while sleeping on this phone and then logged in to the communications service where Hogg received numerous unscrupulous images of the children that another user sent her.
The girl woke up later, found that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She checked her phone and found some shocking messages, and then she immediately told her mother.
When the police saw five pictures, they examined the computers on the ground, and found "sufficient" search on the search lines used to search for unscrupulous images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to attract pedophiles" on the Internet before he proposed to "be a cop to scare them".
Mr Robertson, Commissioner Fical depute, told the Dundeen Sheriff's Court that he said, "It's an additive, that he's dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had performed the graves on his computer but said that they had only been done because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so that he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he did this for bait.
He said he was sick when he was drinking, and he wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added, "When she found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, shaking and crying.
My mother saw the unscrupulous pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, a 23-year-old resident in Ward Road Dundee, admitted that he was guilty of the production or taking of images of unscrupulous children on June 14 last year. He violated his guarantee on 25 January of this year and did not come to court on 24 March of this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be included in the sexual assault register, as it may be claimed that his crime did not include a "markable sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence to October so that social action has time to produce background reports.
Hogg was given guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he is arrested before the hearing.
He was added to the Register of Sexual Crime before the day of conviction.
Robert Mugabe spoke the wrong way to Parliament.
Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell earlier this year in the stairs leading to the talker height.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall spread like the virus in social media.
Parliament’s opening remarks were also made by opposition legislators about the fact that they had been sent anonymous threats of death, which warned them not to gloat Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they called and interrupted him by interrogation while holding a speech to Parliament on the state of the land - what speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader of the group discipline Innocent Gonese said that the seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, which warned them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the title of the message is 'dead'," Gonese told the editors after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant members that immunity would cease in Parliament, and when they stepped out, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group criminal supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "in his care" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to reorganise and cut expenditure in business activities.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, distinguishing between computer and printer business from growing business equipment and service activities.
The expected job cuts will bring costs of approximately $ 2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, as stated in the HP release.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Chairman of HP and CEO, who will run the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move to a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over $50 billion, and it will focus on producing non-compared integrated technology solutions to companies, reports the company's press release.
In the 1930s, Jako will break up a company that was built by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard from Stanford University to produce electricity supplies.
HP has gone through a huge restructuring in order to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology firms in the USA, and its distribution is the latest in the sector, based on the belief that strictly limited companies are doing better.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal says that teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's tie
Wenger has also stressed Wilshire that now it is only September and assuming that he's doing his fitness according to the plans, there is no reason why he wouldn't be playing again by Christmas.
In this case, at least four of the next British games will be missed by Wilshire, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will attend the European Championship next summer.
The biggest pity on this most recent problem is that the end of the last period in Wilshere was strong after a single lantern, and he remembered his old steelness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in shape.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsher had had 23 different injuries since she had debysted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he has played the 157 leagues of Arsenal in only 65 games.
As Arsenal’s wider picture since 2007-08, for six periods of eight it has been one of the Valioliiga teams who have lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger recognises the possibility of a witch, but Arsenal believes that their recent improvement in the disability statistics will continue.
"Even when you return from the injury you may be exposed to the season when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure it will happen, and that he will have a career that he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Master's League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Artta are likely to be on the initiative.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and give it a rest for those who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up to block F, the Maksmir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most frightening in Europe.
Also, Dinamo hasn't lost 41 matches since they produced their own Undefeated campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, a earthquake struck the stadium, which was 3,2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10 in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned about the surrender of the Masters League last season against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I know how realistic we are.
We're ambitious, but we're not wounded.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
The attempt to tackle the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 year of men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
In a recent study, more than 2,000 upper secondary and upper secondary school students showed signs of depression. According to the study, the chance of a person to recover doubled if a high percentage of his friends were "sounded".
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of possible mental problems was halved if they had good friends in mind.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media time of communication, the style passes by content and the lack of response is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, even though isolation actually controls.
This surface success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all of this happens to the personal growth and friendship of the inner longing, which are more deeply influenced by our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer explained recently, money really doesn't get much more happiness.
The fineness of the Frends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Not one character defined their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as friends.
The numerous hugs of Joey and Chandler, the moments I look at football in comfortable chairs, Ross's bored Rachel, became aware that yes, men can identify with all of this, although they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans volunteer explained to me, "I've heard people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understand how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve the environment."
Men who contact us often experience that they cannot speak to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frends are one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although neutral, my external position on the other side of the phone helps people in desperate moments, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And then if you attend Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the photos are redesigned to honor the party, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk's coffee?

Di Maria makes a goal and helps PSG to clear Malmo's side
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored the Master's league by helping the PSG to bypass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Under the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his game with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Parc des Princess on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Master's league in her debut in less than four minutes, showing the French league champions the way, but the team lost a number of possibilities before finally increased their lead on the Cavan attack by 61 minutes.
Paris, who is in the same part A as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, because the game had not only a place to go but also an improvement in their fourth-square games in the last three rounds.
But even though the PSG took points, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the spot in front of the goal and was later replaced from the field. Malmo is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"The league of masters is not easy to win at home or in strangers, so the 2-0 victory brings problems to the opponent and looks good in statistics, and is a good start, even though there are things that we have to do this season," Blanc said.
This is good for you.
We wanted to win and win, although I regret that we failed to make one or two more goals.
After being injured, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team one of the three changes made after the team remained in the 2-2nd game in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux during the weekend, but remained in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine wingman was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when Marco Verratt's feed ran behind Malmö's defence line and then hit the most beautiful finishing of Johan Wiland across the back corner of the network.
However, if someone expected a simple and big victory from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a double opponent. It won Celtic in the final match when it reached this level, with nine international players and five-man defenses and two players in the deep middle field.
But the team didn't offer much on the offensive but the launch of Nikola Djurdjic in 34 minutes, which passed the button by Kevin Trapp.
On the other hand, PSG suffered a shortage of lost feeds and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, which failed in all five companies only during the first half of the year and was then disappointed when Cavani put the ball into contact with Ibrahimovic at the beginning of the second half.
However, she was much more effective in pre-working her colleagues, and she just sent a tour of Ibrahimovic’s feed, a tour of Wiland’s goaltole around 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally reached after an hour of the game, thanks to the uruguayan Cavan of the season, after Ibrahimovic had pushed forward from the left of Maxwell's cross-eating.
It ended Malmö's hopes to get back into the game, and only the great fight against Wiland's direct kick of David Luiz kept the final numbers down before the change of Ezequiel Lavez's goal was completely abandoned at the end of the game.
Malmö Coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last game of the Master's League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
I don't think that's enough.
I'll pick up a hat for Paris.
This was a great game to them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion on stock sales
In Switzerland, Glencore, who suffered price loss of fixed assets, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt settlement plan.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, reported in the notification that it had sold new shares worth some £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of broken down fixed capital goods when the Chinese economy's slowing down its demand and causing destruction on all markets.
The new label increased the value of Glencore shares in the morning shops at the top of the London Stock Exchange.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 in FTSE 100 index, which reached 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed in the last week as part of his wider plan of $2.5 billion stock trade to cut its debt of USD 30 billion by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital of 125 penny shares, which meant a 2.4% reduction at Tuesday’s closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9,99 % of the joint venture.
The concerns of the long-standing Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices to around half, while prices for coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House opinion published on Tuesday.
The first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and will be the reply of President Barack Obama to his last visit to Beijing, the opinion said.
The President of the United States and his wife Michelle Obama will arrange dinner for Xille and his wife, Peng Liyuan, after having held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit by President Xin to allow the extension of cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to speak constructively on issues with differences", was added.
During the visit, which was announced for the first time in February, Xin is also expected to differ in Seattle on its way to Washington to meet a number of US technology leaders before he continues towards New York City and the UN General Assembly of September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber-intelligence and the increased independence of the country in South China's controversial waters.
Matt Damon reduces differences in filmmaking
Matt Damon got together with Effie Brown, an African-American film maker, when he talked about the difference that Damon said he didn't need behind the scenes.
The actor who had experience in the Project Greenlight section of HBO on Sunday night interrupted Brown’s emphasis on the need for different angles as regards the subject of the project’s selected manuscript for the dark-haired head person.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not for the show," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacts with an unbelief, the comments "Oh! Wow. Okay", while the Martian actor's comments were stuck in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's personal character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore his white pimp beats.
The Dear White People producer insisted on the rights of film leadership for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was proud to say that their guidance "can end up giving us something we don't want".
After the conversation had been sent, the social media blew up Damon's comments.
The Twitter user, Mr.Pooni, expressed his anger at the film play, saying, "Matt Damon speaking to the only dark-haired person in the room and explaining the difference to him is NIN'S REAL THAT it hurts."
After his publication, Twitty collected more than 5,000 re-twitches and 4000 pounds.
Damon's comments are at a time when the exact racial presentation on the media is in the interest of social debate.
After killing Michael Brown, a teenager in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spreads into terrestrial and urged legislators and authorities to end practices that discriminate against colourful people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the issue as the winner of the Grammy Prize for the Year's album.
"Albums still have meaning," he said.
As with books and black animals, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter recently published an opinion to respond to the issue of Fox News TV face Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be considered an hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was also said that Damon is involved in it among entertainers, producers and media modules invited to the Pope’s visit to discuss the Catholic Church’s image in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior crowned
On Monday, Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a million dollars prize.
In the competition programme that has just ended its seventh term, there has never been a competitor who would have survived all of the sections of the obstacle path.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero, and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge at the time, making him the first athlete of all time, who survived the 4th part of the American Nin and Warrior. But Caldiero survived the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult victory and was still in shock for winning the million-dollar main prize.
"It's great to think of this when I've never earned or lived as much as $10,000 a year," Isaac told E!
So I suddenly... I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
The director of production, Kent Weed, sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter the fiinalist and why Britten does not receive more reward, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person in the world.
"If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he gets a great deal of satisfaction.
I don't think he'll feel a grudge for that.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
The other half of the season hasn't been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was one of the best baseball teams ever, but now it's the last American League Central division.
Tigers played a joker on Tuesday when it won Minnesota at Twins 5-4 on the Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get up into the game-side head of Houston Astros in a race for another American League wild card.
For Detroit, at least one night the game was back to the sixth term "H" pair, which had been very difficult to reach most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they get them," said Brad Ausmus, Team Manager at Tigers.
The Tigers feeder, Alfredo Simon, continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two shifts, and then once in the sixth and yet again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in shifts and saved three runs.
This was just his third quality shot in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard to feed the changer every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
The Tiggers' deputy, Victor Martinez, hit three times and made it possible for two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three blows after he hit four times against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved good taste," Ausmus said.
He looked good (at the punching exercises), looked much better in the punching exercises and continued with the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh round, and it was their best chance to get back into the game.
Senteri Byron Buxton started the alternator by hitting out twice on the left line.
The right side of Aaron Hicks was home with the finger of a nest, and Simon was able to burn directly into another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with a left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked into Maueria, the only player against him, a pre-initiating deputy named Miguel Sana, who pulled the two nests to the left from Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a flattened runner in the second nest, VerHagen got a three-piece from Trevor Ploffe to hit a double-game-leading ground.
It was the record of the main series: 27th time this season, when Plooffe hit the double.
After Detroit had been on the 9th race, Mauer pulled out two beats against the Tigers sealer Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player burned I in three baits when he saved the fifth.
Detroit started using Phil Hughes, rusty.
Tigers received three runs in the first two pairs against a right-hand veteran player who got out of the list of injured people before the game after being removed for more than a month due to the infection on the lower back.
"It's obvious that I didn't want a start like this," Hughes said, "but as the game went on, I was more comfortable, and I felt like I could make some nice feeds with a third pair of shifts."
After Hughes caught the first nest of the beginner, he gave the second nest to the player Ian Kinsler to move between one.
The walk of J.D. Martinez, in two pieces, brought Victor Martinez, who took himself to the middle field base, and caused the game to run the first.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tubes while running in good running positions.
Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing another to run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected as he tried to move on to the third base.
Tigers continued on the second pass and received one fire, two nested kidnapper from James McCann and two pieces from one nest, in the situation of one nest I ran a cent from Anthony Goselta, followed by a 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said Paul Molitor, team leader of Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feed lockup and fed an unrunned third shifter, after which he replaced the right-hand performer A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs for six punches and four walks.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-hand feeder of Tigers, had to be thrown away from the shoulder because of the stretch of his shoulder.
He was studied by Dr. James Andrews, who cut off Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on a list of injured persons since mid-August due to a shoulder welcome, but he had to return Wednesday.
While Sanchez is outside, the left-handed feeder Daniel Norris will start on the list of injured people against Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four initiatives after the left-hand feeder David Price was replaced with him on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20th, due to the right tip of the stomach muscle.
The three-game series between Tigers and Twins ends on the Target Field Wednesday.
Norris (22, 4.43 ERA) is based on the right-hand feeder of Minnesota against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges the world to open up the economy more widely
The economy must be more open to the outside world in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told on Tuesday to the group to guide the reform.
"The challenge should be to attract foreign funding and expertise and to develop a policy of transparency", he said in his speech at the 16th meeting of the group leading up to the deepening of public reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as further reforms are being carried out with more movement and vitality and creating new conditions for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list limiting access to the market, a lack of border inspection principles, a call on state-owned companies to take up private capital and a revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, identifying the sectors and companies that cannot be invested.
The system is gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The amendment should be significant as it will play a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensure a legal corporate environment and make the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also undermines its control of the power it distributes to business, thereby ensuring that companies decide for themselves how they do their business.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up sectors controlled by the State to private donors, more sectors will be opened up.
The opinion said, "The loss does not change its line about foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies financed by foreigners and provide them with better services."
In addition, permanent resident permits, "green cards", facilitate the search process by optimising requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, who were informed in a post-conference opinion.
