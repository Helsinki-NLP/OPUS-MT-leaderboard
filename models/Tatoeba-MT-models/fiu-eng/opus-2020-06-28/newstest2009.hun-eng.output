The Prague stock exchange was negative at the end of the trade
The Prague Stock Exchange adjusted its losses after the attack in the morning.
Transactions with shares in the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) have reached nearly half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its Monday fall right from the beginning of the Tuesday trade when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street shares is behind the fall.
This is how the market responds to the result of the vote of the American House, which rejected the support for the financial stabilisation plan there.
Fragmentation of shares in Asia
On the Asian stock exchange, the dramatic fall of the shares was carried out on Tuesday, although the indicators during the day eventually deleted part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index recorded almost four percent during the trade, but later some losses were erased and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, monitoring Chinese shares, accounted for 3.8 percent of the markets in Shanghai.
Stock exchange shares lost more than five percent, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
According to that index, Taiwan's stock exchange dropped 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the American rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's money markets," noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently from the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should begin negotiations immediately and accept a proposal for support from the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will understand the consequences of this.
The blood bath of American stock
On Monday, the U.S. Assembly rejected the draft financial support for which 700 billion dollars (up to 12 trillion crowns) should have been paid.
The legislators thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said that the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stock had a blood bath and over 20 years the leading stock indices recorded the largest fall.
Dow Jones suffered almost seven percent, a similar degree of decline last time in 1987.
The index was already in place before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the proposal was not accepted in the House, the index began to break down.
The Congress resigned: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
The main leaders of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed to provide financial assistance to the American financial system.
They will vote on this at the beginning of next week.
American lawmakers have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of USD 700 billion (approximately 12 trillion) to the US financial system.
But there's no victory yet.
The Congress must complete a few details of the agreement before they can disclose the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial support scheme will be discussed at the Assembly Hall on Monday.
He informed the Reuters news agency Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Organisations Committee on Sunday.
Senate sources suggest that they can vote on the draft as soon as possible on Wednesday.
According to economists, it should be reported that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of money markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, "healing" will be done.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We made a big move.
We have solved our differing views on the form of the market stabilisation package," said the Bloomberg Agency, "Democratic Nancy Pelosi."
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
On Saturday night, lawmakers met with Henry Paulson, the American Minister of Finance, to give final form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage activity that puts financial firms in serious losses and endangers the stability of the entire system.
"We are about a draft final agreement that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The draft repair still needs to be continued, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Marking of Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling rapidly.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada said that the lawmakers are therefore trying to reach an agreement in Congress on Sundays.
That is why they want to reassure investors before they start trading in Asian money markets, where the decision of Congress could first affect Monday's trade, due to the time zone.
However, it is not clear yet, when the two chambers of the American Congress vote on the law, as it is, whether the trial can't be over a problem at the last minute.
Lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
As requested by President Bush, the first USD 350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, determined in an additional USD 100 billion and later USD 350 billion, if it feels that the programme does not perform its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
While the President may sin this decision, Congress may, however, override its sin.
However, despite these changes, the programme’s main idea remains, which was the acquisition of financial assets for the purchase of their valuable bad mortgage securities, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to cancel their mortgage loans.
"We've developed everything.
The House should be able to vote on the law on Sundays and the Senate on Monday," said Senator Judd Gregg of the Republicans.
The progress made in the negotiations is also satisfied with President Bush.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesperson, said that the president was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the two-party efforts "to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of bus end-outs
Christopher Dodd, president of the Senate Committee on Banking, who conducted the negotiations, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts and the timing of the draft funding.
The new law also limits the so-called bus satisfaction of the programme managers and establishes the Foundation Supervisory Committee.
The fund should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hard on this, and we made great progress towards an agreement that will work and which will be useful for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to owners who have problems with the cancellation.
In the mortgage purchased by the government, the government would have to recover new instalments, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of the debtors and allowing them to retain their houses.
Marek: Legal aid
According to David Marek, head of Patria Finance, the proposed draft is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"It was because it was not possible to know what mechanism the problem active elements are going to be purchased at.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share losses among themselves," said iHNed.cz this week to iHNed.cz's website Marek.
Marek says it's not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"It is more important for the Congress to decide this week that the plan will be supported, and as soon as possible, they will be blessed.
The importance of reaching an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment," emphasised Marek.
A few battle blade: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobiles are capable of playing MP3 files, no MP3 players can make phone calls.
This makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get home a high-quality high-quality record player to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on bakelite records, but there is no objective reason for this to happen in terms of quality.
If, however, polycai are full of art rock, jazz or blues bakelite, you will probably dream of having this type of record.
This is similar to that intended for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
Some people can't accept an eight thousand crowns for a player, like a Pink Floyd fan probably having a hard time accepting a 20-year-old market earphone.
Two extremities, among which everyone has enough space.
There's a wide choice.
The life of the elements also counts.
Some top-quality musical players are capable of far more than simply playing music, but also of what most mobile players do not happen to.
No current device is as universal as your phone.
The primary features, along with calling and text messages, can play music and video, pick up both, have a better, worse camera, and can even navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and communicators, he'll have a little computer in his pocket.
It's a miracle, because no fridge can grill and no television can photograph.
A number of functional mobiles have disadvantages.
The more feature you use on your mobile, the display sends you to the charger more often.
And music plays are one of the biggest energy players.
Few mobile devices are able to play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
Music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more effective in this regard.
You're counting on cheap phones because they won't be playing for you for more than a few hours.
Even if you have a phone call here and there, get even a charger for your job in case of safety - it also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will have no such problem, even worse ones will have at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
The next problem is that music is uploaded to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readings are used without a adapter with mobile miniature memory cards.
With some exceptions (iPod) you do not need any special software.
Enough of your computer to download your device with music through USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating a series of music libraries that have been set up on the basis of their own records, albums, genres, or, for example, user reviews.
Some devices represent only wood structure like Windows Explorer, and you know some of them (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
For the selection of specific equipment, seek primarily the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output, and, of course, the comfort of treatment.
If music serves you primarily as a background and listens to it every day for a short time, for example, on the electricity, whatever your MP3 player mobile is suitable for you.
And that's what any mobile can do.
You don't have to pay special attention to what kind of musical formats your cell phone or player knows.
Each MP3 is in the process and the final majority of music to you is going to be in this format.
The MP3 is among the most widely used and the majority of devices are also handled by WMA format music.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow for online music shopping, for example.
Enough to visit the relevant pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service can be a powerful reason for purchasing music mobiles on its own.
Unfortunately, the offer offered by service providers is limited to dumb and usually limited to single radio screens.
Even the lowest prices.
In general, however, it can be assumed that music will dominate the music industry in the future (as well as through GSM, Internet or wireless internet).
Most people keep their mobile device on their own.
Any time you want to listen to something, your cell phone's in your pocket, while the forgotten MP3 player at home is lying.
However, it also depends on whether the earphones are always carried with you or at least the loudspeakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with almost every cell phone, but only have few MP3 players.
For many, music phones are likely to be the biggest advantage of the price.
The most expensive ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a pretty decent walkman.
However, you are mostly restricted by the absence of a conventional earphone output.
Telephones with conventional earphones of 3.5 mm diameter may also cost up to 12,000 crowns of the best and technically equipped.
The advantage of the players, however, is, among other things, simple handling.
The simplest, and certainly not necessarily the most expensive way to treat the cheapest players (see our choice), really everyone is going to deal with it.
The minimum function, which is similar to the previously standard tape recorder or gramophone, is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of an accidentally connected mobile internet, nor of a huge bill following the transmission of data.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually also open to interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can add the appropriate card to up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic types support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can start with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cow, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irish.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 times.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 controller key, so the comfort of the treatment can reach the MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Ericsson reached the farest, which has the same user interface of walkman's serial mobiles as MP3 players.
The MP3 players mentioned above can provide the same service in the same price category up to four thousand kronors, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (approximately 15 hours up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider is still going to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech countries is relatively developed and our services are practically the same as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we are missing something here - a virtual service provider for significant price reductions for classical service providers.
Maybe it won't be long.
We have often written on the Mobile.cz website that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of text in the Czech Republic is more expensive than that of the other EU countries.
After the last step of the European Commission to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a conflicting situation - some of its customers from abroad will be cheaper than domestics.
How is it possible that Czech prices are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, and there is no competition that really wants to fight.
That may sound conflicting, because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are willing to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This often agrees with Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, who has previously stated several times that there is no place for another service provider in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the classic service provider with its own network is probably no longer too much of a chance (although it would probably be difficult to find the frequency).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
It was precisely the step taken by virtual service providers on the mobile market that had to respond to significant price reductions, and then the classic service providers had to respond.
In the meantime, even before the big fish were placed on the market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virginia Mobile Great Britain, sounds like ours have been heard.
However, it has been demonstrated that such service providers have a position and that they can really succeed.
However, we don't have to go too far for an example.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the Mobile virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider managed to obtain more than 100 thousand customers in less than six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime Mobilking is behind the Penta Financial Group, which is owned by the U:fon, in addition to the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much more limited target group.
For efficient operation requires much less customers than traditional service providers.
It does not involve relatively high building, mobile network management and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus generally show up at low cost - offer cheap calls and text messages, which are often offset by less services.
For example, Tesco Mobile from Great Britain offers 50 percent cheaper text than its competitors.
But as shown by the example of Mobiling in Poland, it can be a very good move towards a target group.
This service provider is particularly focused on men.
"The real men choose Mobile Service providers, who likes who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who runs this virtual service.
It is difficult to tell if such an idea can work for us in Poland.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesperson, questions this: "The Czech market is relatively small to the segmental approach on which most virtual service providers are based.
In addition, the provision of services has been relatively satisfactory."
In the Czech Republic, set mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there are any virtual service providers in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobileing.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem to be a source of hope.
The launch of Mobilking is more likely to take place in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the Penta financial group in her telephone interview to Mobil.cz.
In addition, it has been demonstrated that existing mobile operators in Czech Republic are not too related to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition exists.
The GTS Novera group has not kept its interest in launching a virtual service provider for a long time, which is intended to take another step in order to make Phoneica O2 a real competition at the company’s market.
"We are very interested in providing not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
The sooner, the better.
We discussed this option again with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the spokesperson of the group.
Maybe there's a better time.
Unofficial information seems to us to be lucky for the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"In this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would be located on the Czech market.
Unlike the other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been called into question by an uneven subject offering complex and serious projects in this area," said Mobile.cz, on the 02 press class of Vlastimil Sršeí, Telefónica.
The specific situation of the Czech market is also referred to by other service providers.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile's spokesperson, in agreement with O2, adds: "We have not been able to record any viable and bilaterally advantageous business projects that could be based on any further."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network until the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider would show up.
At this moment, there should be a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think about it in such a short time."
Vodafone is more concerned about meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We have been able to negotiate with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
That's exactly what we think from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is a partnership to build networks shared with fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - a string with service providers
Mobile operators’ procedures are easy to understand, the entry of a new service provider would lead to a rise in competition, a fall in prices and a reduction in their profits.
So why should we ease the entry of such a competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate, they also witness a huzvona around the birth of U.fon.
The greatest pressure on ČTú was probably around the birth of the U-phone of the T-Mobile company.
This is evident from the publicly available information on ČTÚ's website.
But right now, U-fon is a good reason why we don't allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been hampered by access to the fourth mobile service market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player into the market and services would be subject to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of mobile operators, the whole lack of interest of Czech regulators is absolutely amazing.
In the meantime, it is not only a ČTU attitude, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to intervene in economic competition.
The Office of Economic Competition is only entitled to do so.
But the office is characteristic of the whole problem.
"The move of the virtual service provider to the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, since the offer of potential interested parties to traditional service providers was probably not interesting," said Kristian Chlapua, the Department of External Relations, to answer our question.
A statement made in this way by representatives of service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the Office, which should represent the interests of consumers and, moreover, ensure that no one can recover from their market situation, this is more than odd.
In particular, if Kristián Chalua adds: "In a country where virtual service providers are generally operating, we can observe that their step towards the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
However, there is probably no pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and on lower prices.
In this case, the three mobile service providers' response is indeed shocking.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence, it's almost self-evident.
As for charging stations, the fully identical gas prices are probably only the works of random and tough competition.
"The Office did not discover the signs of the anti-competitive procedure in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
No service provider has a leading position, i.e. no more proportionately responsible for its market activities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing to the telecommunications regulator," said Cha permission.
The presentation of the market leadership situation is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the perspective of economic competition.
After doing so, of course, there is no Czech service provider in a leading position.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator is always necessary to establish a virtual service provider.
And the mobile service provider has a monopoly on his own network, relatively logically.
So it's necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum boost for U.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.R. that three mobile operators act in a similar way.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including mentioned GTS Novera companies) show that there are similar obstacles to all service providers during the negotiations.
The removal of responsibility to ČTU is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with UOHS taking his hand off the whole case.
We've already met in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the expansion of the powers of ČTÚ in economic competition in telecommunications has failed to be carried out, although a number of experts were hoping to improve the situation.
Members of the U.S.S.S.S.S.A. need to know that well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one's watching
Meanwhile, the operation of some types of false virtual service providers, many of which already operate in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that sell their own mobile phone lists, but only partially public.
It's the same multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The pricelists of these companies usually reach only the selected ones.
The magic is due to the company acting as a classic corporate customer against the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an outstanding customer, you will receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar promotions.
"If there were cases you were talking about, it could be a breach of contract terms that we would be dealing with and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with a particular company," answered Martina Kemrová on this issue.
But it is rather unlikely that the news about such activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile service providers.
In particular, for the three mentioned companies thousands of customers may be involved.
In the meantime, no service provider is protecting against such a procedure.
For they do not have negligible profits and, in contrast to the actual virtual service providers, they do not particularly threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculations, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not on their phone, so that they cannot have full access to it, as are the general clients of mobile service providers."
But it's exactly what ČTú should be doing.
In addition, there is another question for U.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.
If mobile service providers overlook similar procedures, why prevent the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that UOHS has relatively strong powers to detect such activity and, if you do not want to, does not have to satisfy service providers' explanations that nothing of this kind has been suspected and that their commercial terms prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable reduction in the price of services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual service providers were established, classical service providers tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, perhaps too satisfied, to the market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, at these very moments, regulators were involved, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Then, with formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the first virtual service provider that others followed.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are giving each other the whole issue.
On the basis of our experience, we can't get rid of the impression that they're well equipped in these cases.
But let's not fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider does show up soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the service providers allowed the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, UOHS will only be difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection of further interested parties (discrimination).
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be making more expensive calls.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to four processings of the new Czech state anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented his new recordings of the Czech State Day with a solemn display of my country?
The hinnust was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bęlohlavek.
Four versions are available - male or female solo, singer or instrument.
Kateřina's going to Knřžínko and Adam Plachetka sing.
Authors of the amendment of the hymnus Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
The Czech national song is considered one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already told him that he deliberately selected young performers with representative voice to sing the songs, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to handle the pure composition, the clarity of the text, and the harmony, later on at the band," he said.
The Czech state passion celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
Where is my country?’s song first silenced at the Rendi Theatre in 1834, supplemented by the music of Josef Kajetan Tyl Fidlovačka, František Škroup.
He became popular, and people thought he was spontaneously their own.
And the first verse of the song became the natural part of the state hymnus after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
What a "new" hymnus looks like
The Prague transport company will deliver the chip card for the first time on Wednesday.
Wednesday 1 October 2008 describes itself as a date in the history of the Prague Transport Company, when the first passenger will enter the subways, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available for about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers may buy 30 days and 90 days, as well as an annual coupon (which will be valid as of 1 January 2009) and at the same time save the Transport Company on information centers and premises at the Muzeum, Místek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andęl, Roztyly, Letřany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons are already available online from yesterday's website through the Transport Company's website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who are starting to use online trading may ultimately forget the publishing windows of metro stations, where they have so far had to perform long lines for line tickets on a regular basis.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and entered into the Opencard card in one of the 13 accounts of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers will have a bar with trained servers who will help the interested parties in buying the Internet and save their purchased coupons on their cards," said Martin Opatrný, the speaker of the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons will be able to save Opencard in some self-service machines equipped in the lobby.
How do these machines look?
Pirosak, the ticket managers, and passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Budęjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Whoever has five in the city, but it should be eight by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
The coupon controls the driver instead of the driver
It's easy to handle the automatics that start tomorrow.
Enough to insert the Opencard chip card, and the coupon paid earlier will go away on its own.
Electronic coupons are not only valid in the capital from tomorrow, but also around the city.
So, on trains and bus lines around the city, from 300 to 499, with residents travelling to the capital, mainly in Central Chad.
"On board integrated trains in Prague, fishermen were seen with card readers to determine the zone validity of the coupons," explained the inspection of the lines by Philip Dear from the Ropid, which compiled the timetable for public transport in Prague.
In buses around the city, card readers are fitted with the driver at the wallet.
The driver must therefore not only show the chip card at the time of entry, but also have to place the Opencard in a specified location on the wallet side.
The driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it's easier to ask the driver for this," he added.
Passengers who do not travel to buses around the city and will not remember when their coupon validity goes down may again return to self-service machines that rescue the coupons.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
The Sudanes wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeta Germans were requested to join the United States in 1945.
This is reflected in the letter in the collection of the scientific library in South Czech Republic.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the Patronate of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 some of the German groups in Sudan turned to the President of the United States.
This is also reflected in a letter from a private archive that is currently stored in the collection of the scientific library in South Czech Republic.
The Germans from Česky Krumlov ask the President of the United States not to allow the return of the 'šumava county' to the Czech Republic, which was also introduced by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"We have read the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops will come to the German territories in no way as a suppressor and enemy," it says in the letter, "Embers who carry the fate of Shumava in their hearts".
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia is supposed to give hope to the Germans - in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character - only to brutality, mercy, understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take over Shamava as the protectate "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this area would be regarded as a foreign country that suppresses and breaks the minority, and with almost nothing will contribute to the victory of the allies," says the letter.
The reason the authors couldn't sign is the fear of revenge from the "csehicles".
Thus, if the President of the United States was supposed to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Shumava, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in the county of Shumava whether his residents would want to become part of the United States and whether they would wish to live under the pathonization of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive in addition to the current knowledge of postwar history, some historians describe properly the expectations of the Germans.
Even if Czech Germans had to have the minimum guess that they were going to be out of the country, only a few of them recognised this possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudanese.
Others again believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budęjovic.
Chaluva served as a German during the war in the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war the British caught him and put him in the horstynsk detention camp, a dozen other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned, they could use the Czech language," Chalua said.
According to the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one reported that they were moving out of the country on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You're not thinking, you're paying!
The emotional campaign attacks the leaders
In Czech history, the most expensive action to ensure the safety of roads.
The media campaign on emotions that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday would thus also be representative.
Minister Aleš ‹ebíček's office on this campaign hopes to discourage the leaders of dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million-wide campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
The leaders should be deprived of speed and alcohol.
And you should also remind them that their seatbelts are covered before they start.
First and foremost, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least, are interested in the conscience of professional drivers.
And what shows up in commercials?
It's human stories, especially, that attacking emotions.
That's what the whole campaign's "bloody" symbol is testifying about:
You're not thinking, you're paying!
The term "don't think" on the license plate is written in large letters.
And there's the word "pay me" in the bloodthirsty.
This must represent the fact that you can pay for a moment's lack of attention with your life.
The viewers will be "tired" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the eels countries, where dramatic images of victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercial prizes were made by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, let the drivers do it
"For drivers, pull, let's see" is valid.
For them, 'sustain' is when they go through the red and save time.
Pull 'em in the punishment or the risk of an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, and they think it's the psychologist.
According to him, the driver's attention to the threat is less effective.
"If the hazard warning board is fitted, it is likely that it will soon coincide with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," said Kořán.
Almost all the occupied areas would be returned in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke practically of the return of all territories occupied in 1967, namely Jordan's western coast, East Jerusalem and the Golan-fennsík, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview that was published on Monday at the Jediot Achron.
"We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all of them, if not all of them (we have to return) areas," said Olmer to the newspaper.
"We hold a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians have to give a similar percentage of Israeli territories, because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that the possible surrender would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through his feet, as happened with one of my best friends must give up a part of Jerusalem," noted Olmer, referring to the attack on two July cities, where some people were killed and a few dozen were injured.
The Prime Minister said it would be necessary to find a special solution for "The Temple Mountain, holy and historic places" in the Old Town.
"The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work," he stressed.
Exit from the Golanfennski
He also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from Golanfenns, which he considered essential for the peace treaty to be concluded with Syria.
This, however, would require some effort from Damascus.
"I don't recommend peace-making with Syria solely on the basis of a departure from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians well know what they have to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Síite Movement); they must provide regular support, which is given to terrorism in Iraq by Hamas (Síite Movement), Al-Qaida and Djihad (Szen War)," explained the Prime Minister.
Questions after an accident: Are passengers on buses illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you don't have to walk in a long-distance bus
The question of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padova in Italy was whether passengers and passengers could travel on the bus during the journey.
"If we were to comply strictly and formally with the law, the passenger’s activities are in conflict with the Transport Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, a twenty-two-year-old passenger would probably end up with the driver of a truck crossing the bus.
The girl was sitting next to the driver at that moment, the bus was at least safe location, although two more places were reserved for her.
The bus can hit or suddenly stop even at the moment the passenger is serving coffee or offering a newspaper.
It is in its capacity as to whether the bus has its seat under the traffic authorisation.
If there is no homology on the bus, passengers should be seated.
Student Agency buses do not have seats; as confirmed by Radim Jančura, the company manager.
"We tried to find a solution to this Ministry, and at first, passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seats," said.
The law doesn't know the passenger.
"There is no clear legal vacuum for the passenger's role - no legislation regulates this position.
However, the carrier does not prohibit the provision of services by any legislation.
The Road Traffic Act only recognises the concept of a vehicle pilot; its rights and obligations are not defined," adds Hanzelka's spokesperson less clearly.
On the contrary, Mr Pokorný, Director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes that the law is properly addressing the problem.
"It depends on whether or not there is a seat in the bus’s traffic authorisation.
And it's over," he says.
Buses may discriminate against cities where there are seats and limited maximum speed, with seats between cities and permitted higher speeds, without remote seats and with maximum permitted speed, seats with safety belts.
As on the plane, say the expert
Mr Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP’s safety expert on passenger movements, does not see a fundamental problem on board the bus.
"There is no danger of continuing progress, we can compare the situation to the service on the plane.
I'm not sure when there's Turbulence and an air-tight pilot can hit his head."
"But if the bus stops suddenly, of course the physical laws are valid.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of passengers must be resolved by the carrier with internal rules," he says and believes that the problem has not been resolved in terms of law.
Jančura is ready to shut down services
Student Agency offers passenger service as the only bus carrier.
He's working for 200 passengers.
The Director doesn't think they're risky after the accident.
"But I'm going to have the impression that the activities of passenger pilots are risky and I'm going to lose it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers when boarding.
This would be cost savings," he says.
In his operations, Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates the fraction of flights compared to Student Agency, justified the absence of passenger pilots.
"We don't have passengers, we're opposed to this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of fatal injury," said barely a year ago to Týden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy.
A young passenger who worked for the company two years ago died during a regular flight in Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably pulled out of the lower strip without using a direction indicator and stopped the bus route.
The driver of the bus suddenly tried to get out with a maneuver, but the better front part of the bus hit him.
That the sale of two reserved places to relax passengers would be rejected by Jančura.
"These places can't be booked for long-distance flights, blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck manager.
By compensating her family, the agency does not expect a court order, but expects financial compensation from the offender.
Law amendment?
In the Far Future
The clarification of the movements of passengers on board the bus could mean a change in the law on which the group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
"However, the group did not achieve any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with the maximum speed and mobile use during driving," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passengers to be something that would essentially threaten passengers' safety," Hanzelka concludes her speaker by being responsible for controlling the safety of buses and buses.
The expectations of dysseldorf go to Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB’s board of directors to the bank’s staff is not limited in words.
The merger between the units of the dysseldorf financial institution and the Deka-Bank in Frank could be created by the "central equity organisation of the savings fund group" - writes the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competence block" into a store like this.
Such a relationship could give the final push to further concentrations in the province banking sector.
This is a reading of a board of directors ’ desire to prove its viability in difficult times.
As a bank with uncertainty continues to face great pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Service Authority, which has recently informed the Province of North Rhine-Westphalia that the time limit for finding a lasting solution is limited.
However, a long time ago the theme of a kind of relationship - also in the French part - has been between Deka-Bank and WestLB for savings fund clients.
Franz Waas, head of Deka-Bank, announced, at the end of August, that the Mainzer Landstraße bank and a province bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not see any meaning.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is one half representatives of the Landesbanks and the other half is representatives of the savings fund associations, has entrusted the board with the task of continuing negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
In doing so, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be involved.
However, negotiations - set financial limits - have just begun.
The name of Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employers of the financial sector, with 3000 staff, does not for the first time arise as regards the consolidation of the savings funds sector.
In 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to unite with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, none of these three alliances became apparent.
The plans have barely been made public, and the Government of the Province has spoken against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks didn't find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to Stuttgarti Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
However, again and again the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and Landesbank has been raised.
Last but not least, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba Board of Directors, spoke against the plans of mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, there is a need to approach the various banks of the emancipated sector.
The first link between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected after the elections in the Province of Bavaria.
That's not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If further fusion pressure is increased, potential partners may soon run out.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger partner, since the financial crisis has so far been significantly more damaged than the München and Stuttgart banks.
The merger with WestLB in Helaba was ruled out at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has had a business section of 85%.
The NordLB will be better off.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other side, the question arises as to how different business models of each bank fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Trade Bank and the jury have not yet answered the crucial question about the business model to ensure the future of the Landesbanks.
Finally, it can be imagined that WestLB is cut up, but it does not want to be clearly there.
Thus, the letter from the Board of Directors there states that they are definitely seeking a "full solution".
How this is compatible with the merger of each unit with Deka-Ban is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "Old Week"
Elena's first, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena's girlfriend is here, and so everything's different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser’s five-litre barrel, there is a strong man with a body-shaped beard, and it proves to some 200 people traveling to Oktoberfest that he can draw the deep sound from his throat.
Elena first surprised Luca's face, then kissed him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus stop near Puorta Nuova train station, four buses depart at 23.45 at "destinazione Monaco", painting della birra", arriving at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are held mainly by Italians, and in the fourth, only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans have already been singing by their flag, and during the night they started celebrating.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
Buses are owned by Marco, who wears long, artificial-sleeved coats and large silver-stacked glasses.
She's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years. She's only organized three ways this year.
At night, during the day at Oktoberfest, home at 22:30.
The accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenditure," Marco says.
The road costs 75 euros, including Kaiser beer, accident insurance and German tourism - a German course was completed in Frankfurt by Marco.
And they're already putting themselves on the bus night towards Brennero on the highway.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will slow down soon, passengers will sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there are several Italian buses on motorway 8 even taking a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 according to the plan, there are almost 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's gonna keep one last piece of information, describe the plan of war.
First, everybody pick up the yellow hat.
It is available on the left side of the text "Oktoberfest", next to Marco's travel office's Internet address: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second of all, "When the beers open the gates, run," Marco calls in the morning.
"Go!" Take places from the back of the tent.
"Not in advance, because we're stuck, and not on the same bench all yellow hats, but let's spread out in the tent."
One-litre basket costs €8.25, yelling Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show security guards that you're doing well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they'll be taken."
And third, "To this evening, stay here at 6:30 a.m. again." Do you understand?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one man makes yellow caps on trees, tablets, and even one of the great Bajoran folk election posters.
We need to prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as the “Oss weekend”.
There are no exact figures; they speak of 50,000 people who cross the Alpokon in the beer canoes, which are reported to be ten percent of all visitors of the weekend arriving from Italy.
The München police are confirmed by seven South Tirol police officers, Italian volunteers help the Bajor Red Cross, which in their national statistics contains about 200 medical care for the first place, preventing the Austrians (about 80) and the fallen British (about 60).
The Italians were particularly fond of the Hofbräu beer maker.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by Peer Steinbrück's Federal Finance Minister only last week.
It's a good thing that the politician used the word "relatively" and even said it was that the German banking sector was not protected by crisis-like developments.
Because this weekend did happen.
Daxon’s listed Müncheni Hypo Real Estate (HRE) real estate financing company received a billion loans from the German banks’ consortium to protect itself against market turbulence.
One person who knew the situation told Reuters on Monday that credit subsidies were paid to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest after the part used.
The money is partly from private and partly public banks.
Depfa's subsidiary's losses are in the background.
Depfa, running state funding, according to a newspaper, lent money for long-term projects and refinanceed itself for a very short period of time, which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 per cent to EUR 2,37 million and its equity ratio declined moderately from 1,6 to 1,45 per cent.
Current income and net income from the money business fell back to zero from the same period of the previous year, from credit claims and certain securities, and from the liquidation of credit business reserves, by more than 70 %, to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher revenues resulting from the conversion of the former Depfa group’s ex post accounts, as well as the reimbursement of interest due under the levying order and the sale to the companies in the consortium had a relatively low income deficit of 16%.
Following the privatisation in 1990, the former state-finance company had previously been speculating with corporate real estate loans, which were later isolated in Aeral Bank.
In view of the limited availability of classical state funding, Depfa was more strongly involved in infrastructure projects as well as in the joint projects of private investors and the state (privat-public-partnership, PPP) and has expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now needs to perform descriptions that "essentially impact" on the performance of the group has been reported in a rather general way.
In fact, there's no dividend payments.
The dividend has already been reduced by the third time in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major public and infrastructure-financer since Depfa was taken over.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing as it does not have client deposits.
With the collapse of the American Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the bank's lending went down because the banks kept their liquidity.
In order to refinance some of the Deffa credit portfolio of Hypo Real Estate - some EUR 50 billion - needs short-term assets annually.
According to the Hypo Real Estate communication, the Group's financing needs are covered for a period of time that can be seen with the loan, and the company is protected "from the influence of the currently highly inefficient international money markets."
According to other sources, the refinancing will be ensured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Mr Funke, Chairman of the HRE Board, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not use the financial markets for a reasonable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group is already ensured.
It gives hope to the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But the dynamics and inconsistency of the crisis are certain.
It cannot even be imagined that there is no need to make full use of funding.
But there's no way out of this.
After Saturday's late evening news, the bank was still on the edge of the bankruptcy, the temporary salvation of the equal could not reassure the sports.
The share price dropped by a 75 percent decrease to EUR 3,30.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite well held.
While the first-rate debt is barely changing, the exchange rates of the outstanding bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis affects the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, as far as possible, the fumamirs over 2009 are concerned.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be an alternative to speculative investment, they now need to be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system and in view of the fact that the financial institution took the crisis almost home by taking Depfa to home.
As long as the central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it may be based on the cancellation of the fines by the time limit.
Or what happens is that almost no one dares hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports on partial nationalisation, the limited probability of certainty has now become a mere legitimate remony.
For long-term creditors, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether or not to choose from their investment.
Short-term investors may use sales however to make provision for taxes payable for the exchange rate gains of the years to come.
Secrets of Sylvana and the Inner Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself at the Tachibana Highschool on his first day of teaching, the girls start to whistle: The German girl is a total "planí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word about the mangos - the new exchange blog tells about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was already on my way to school.
I'm on the edge of Tokyo, heading to Kavaszi, and I'm on a train to Tachibana Highschool for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way alone, and luckily, I wasn't mistaken.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban isn't taken as seriously as home in Alsó-Sásza.
The students start whining from eight o'clock until a short conversation starts at 8 o'clock with the teacher, the home room.
But before the teaching began, I had the line to introduce myself.
I'm not the type who would like to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I hired an old skirt from my hostess to bring in a shirt, a blue knee and a black leather shoes.
So I was in this dress before the cathedral, and I tried to say it all correctly, "Sunjonara, vo se Sylvana..." - I came to Sylvana, Germany, and in a week, my birthday will be.
At this point, I was very happy that I've been learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls were squealing, squealing and squealing, and I kept hearing the word "squirrel."
I've known this from my maneuvers.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, and it means " cute, sweet."
And then I went to my place.
The girl next to me, she smiled, was honored to have been sitting next to the exchange.
The rest of the watch was quite calm, but when the bell sounded, they ran out of order.
Everyone was talking and laughing, and with questions they put a hole in my belly - and it's quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break, everyone packed their insides.
My host made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got a spice of rice, small sausages, cucumber and alga salad, fruit, and a kind of tofu meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Foods look weird, and they have a whole new taste.
In fact, everything's very good.
Yeah, maybe with the exception of salty silhouette, Brrr.
In Japanese schools, it's not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy her own hand made of input, especially made by artists - in the hope that she can get to know him more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
"Why is it Japan?" - asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because you're just charming."
After all, I've been reading mangoes for years.
And to understand the comic books and the culture they described, I started to study Japanese some time.
It was quite clear to me that I would have to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're very closed in here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of recent techniques and trends - and on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats have feelings, too.
A rat or something like that is running out of danger, does that mean he's feeling scared?
Joseph LeDoux, a neurologist, is convinced that animals have feelings.
But how can we examine if they feel the same way when they act like ours?
In the "Edge" magazine, scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
PIEGEL ONLINE in one of its series, "What does it hold true, without being able to prove it?" she looks at the answers she has received.
I believe that animals have emotions and other state of mind, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, that it is true that we cannot even prove that other people are aware of it.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of every human brain is the same.
However, as we examine other species, and in general, we dispel issues of consciousness, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: pretending he's dead, running or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, resulting in comparable subjective experience among some researchers.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to take over our own subjective experiences.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits are almost always contained in the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to the short-term memory and the role of implementation/control functions).
This wide area is more advanced for humans than for other major mammals, and it appears that it is lacking than other creatures.
At least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the awareness of who we are or, in the case of design and decision-making ability, may reasonably be expected to differ from other major breasts.
Another dramatic feature lies in the language nature of man: Since human experience is a significant part of the language, it is often claimed to depend on this knowledge.
In this case, the animals can be excluded.
However, even if it did not depend on the language, the language would certainly affect, so animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is likely to differ strongly from most of our state of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine the awareness of other animals.
If knowledge is neither internal nor subjective, and because of the special hardware, it cannot be analysed on the basis of our own experience, then our research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my reasoning applies to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be more accessible to science.
It would be possible to examine animals’ knowledge processes regardless of conservation, and that is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on the short-term memory of the main mammals, in particular in the case of visualization.
However, this assumption that Christof Koch and Francis Crick have been examined is based more on the nervous contexts of consciousness than on the indirect mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex in developing visualization.
What happens to this emotion?
This is because an emotional system, such as fear, is activated in a brain that knows its own activity.
So what we call "disgusting" is the mental state in which we are when the activity (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) of the defensive system in the brain takes a work memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to areas of the brain tissue that are characteristic of the main breasts and especially of man.
Complementary with the language character, perception is a fine step, because with words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize these conditions to others.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions are derived from simpler activities of the corpuscles of the brain and brain stems, just like Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overall emotions of species.
I can't deny this theoretically, but I think it's inexplicable.
The bankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and people is likely to feel that in both cases: how can rats and humans be checked to feel the same when they act similarly?
A cockroach escapes in case of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not yet evidence of the same experience.
Although neurological comparisons help further: rats and humans are similar to brain failure, the roaches do not even have a brain.
But the brain is responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proved for humans, how can we prove that to rats?
I think rats and other mammals have feelings, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?).
However, I don't know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (based on human consciousness's special circuits and language), I study the emotional behaviour of rats rather than their emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area will be tweaked at the neurological level if measured in rats and humans.
As I don't study language and consciousness in rats, I don't know if there's any feelings.
It may seem like a short-sighted attitude to others, but I'm moving forward rather than hitting on a wall constantly.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Date of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vaszjunik said that preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the confidence in Ukraine in UEFA's decision in Bordeaux and its evidence that they believe that Ukraine is able to organise the European Championship jointly with Poland", said Vasjunik.
"This, however, does not mean an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries."
As regards the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are failing.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste more time.
"We have to work with a gun," said Grigorij Surkis, Chairman of the Ukrainian Labdacking Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they wanted to take a more radical step.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, which was replaced by the independent inspector Robert Zawlock.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is the danger that PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have assured Michel Platinum, President of the UEFA, that this will not adversely affect the preparation of the EB 2012."
In the past season alone, several first swinging teams had to be classified in the lower class because of manipulating, and finally the league was to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid, the infamous Dennis Quaid, is going back.
The actress wanted to promote a new film, talk about her private life in interview, and now she's in trouble with her ex-husband.
The one who's evaporating - and the one who cuts back
The war of the late roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex couple: The two Hollywood actors seven years after their divorce fight with each other - to the public.
And Ryan, in an interview with the American InStyle magazine, first said about the reasons for the divorce last week: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
And after the divorce, he knew how many women Dennis cheated on him.
Ryan's new press work on his spiritual stripper, "The Women" film, was carried out to tell the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to the expression of the unfaithful husband, "Glordy" - said the 54-year-old actor in the New York Daily News newspaper, "that Meg is an boring repeater and spends the history of our relationship."
And it's also "sorry" that 16-year-old boys, Jack, are repeatedly "remembered of many pains and changes caused by divorce to a child."
While Ryan has lived alone since his divorce, Quaid has become married again, and recently he has become the father of a twin pair.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following paragraph: "My life continues anyways.
"I know I'm happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is the greatest fit."
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany are less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of air travel and hotel rooms have again become more favourable, thus summarising the results of a study of American Express's travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its first half-year booking data and, after the first quarter price increase, there was a significant drop in the second quarter.
After rising prices on the hotel market for years, many places have become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices of 48 European cities examined increased on average by 6.9 per cent compared to 2007.
However, during the period April to June prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
This trend appeared in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees this as a low rate of money, which led to the ' American tourists' desire for travel.
The fall in hotel room prices is more likely to affect financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannort, Kölnt or Stavanger.
The 26.3% increase in hotel prices in Norway is a European record.
There was also an increasing trend towards air fares in the first quarter.
Due to the dwindling of kerosine, passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent in the tourist class than in 2007, and long-term long-term long-term long-term long-term flights with high fuel demand were 29.2 per cent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist class flights decreased by 12.5 per cent on average compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 per cent.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany decreased to half.
The result of the fall in prices is, on the one hand, due to moderate economic growth, the company claims.
There was a decline in demand in several segments of the en route market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe increases the pressure of competition.
The situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines are breaking down their losses and several airlines declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV beats Gladbach to 1.0
A goll and simple methods were placed at the top of the table at Hamburger SV.
In Borussia, Luhukay still doesn't have the working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flight for the national selection of Marko Marin.
The gladbach player just got into the game late, and the raise came back from the gate.
His exact message has left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger, in the corridor leading to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat in their seats again.
Rieger was a physics therapist of HSV for nearly three decades, and he enjoys greater authority than some hair-dating players.
So he found his request for a hearing in the competent place.
Cornelius Jol was an assistant coach, and he showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's brother in Hamburg.
His orders could have been similar, here with the second goll!
The execution of the command has failed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight" - added Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt also imagined it.
The 1: 0 (1: 0) goal results were due to the Hamburgan Mladen Petric Head (11.); and to the fact that the very weak gladbachians were unable to cause pain to the weak burgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV is now 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers have celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the exhibitor, which presented their team as the first class of the championship.
It's gonna be a party-free birthday.
"We know where to put it" said Marcel Jansen.
It should be noted that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the domination of the HSV.
Although the team finds itself slowly thanks to its late dedicated facilities, the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the gate Petric and Jansen from FC Bayer, who are not yet billiarded.
"We need more sensibility and mutilation," said Jol.
After the autopsy
Wall Street comes with fear.
As a result of the first news of the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily fell to 700 points.
That was the biggest loss in his history in one day.
Later, a little bit of Dow was getting stronger.
At 20:30, the world's most important stock exchange poultry had a negative 5 percent, and it stood at 10.579 points.
The technology paper dealer Nasdaq fell to 1548 points by more than seven percent minus one.
The biggest loser in Dow at this time was American Express with 14% loss, followed him by the Bank of America by 12 percent.
Not one piece of paper ever strengthened me.
The shares in Goldman Sachs have fallen by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier, Warren Buffett bought his share in the bank.
In the context of the rescue action, resources are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called double mortgage securities.
However, this amount is not at the same time, but is intended to be paid gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive shares options from financial institutions which would be different in the event of appropriate exchange rate developments, reducing the burden on the Treasury.
At the end of the period, European and American and US stock exchange rates
The billions of aid granted to European and US banks do not dispel investors' doubts.
The stock exchange of the Hypo Real Estate German large bank will fall and grab Dax.
Despite saving the money market state, the American Dow Jones indicator is declining.
The spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank were deeply pushed into the minus by the German shareholder (Dax).
Despite the rescue measures of the federal government and private banks, the value of the property financier in Munich fell to a quarter, the Commerzbank was down by more than 20 percent.
Dax is a psychologically important 6000 accurate limit, and with a 3,7 percent minus 5839 points.
Stock markets have been forced to knees around the world.
Wall Street opened in New York with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to make the money markets go slow.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3.3 percent down to 10.809,25 points.
The U.S. Assembly wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate may vote on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges have only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a 3.2 percent weakening, and in Paris, CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikki index dropped by 1.26 percent after the initial increase to 11.743,61 points.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped back to 18.286,90 by 2.1 per cent.
The Indian Sensex indicator dropped 506,43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor’s shares were weakened following the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer's private bank has recorded 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist brand also said that Thomas Cook did not sell shares.
Dark material affects space probes flying
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused dissatisfaction among researchers. Dark matter affects the speed of the probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's overall issue of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The Ulyssian probe flew in space for almost 18 years.
Soon, the freezing fuel pipelines are threatening the ice death.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon, a swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means the gravity price level of the probes, where a heavenly body, such as Earth gravity, is added to an additional momentum.
So probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick just like Ulysses' sun probe.
What, however, has been in the midst of researchers for many years: Flying objects are not fully behaved as it would be expected under the ancient gravity law.
Instead, abnormalities occur at speed.
The probes suddenly accelerate or slow down.
So far, the physicists have found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized as a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts are afraid that even Albert Einstein's general relativity is not fully valid, which takes up the mass movement of the material as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler American Physics, an associate of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong, and he's trying to explain the anomaly of swing-by with the so-called dark material that the astronauts discovered in the universe.
"For the anomaly, dark matter can be responsible, which may even be found all the way to Earth," says Adler.
For only ten years, universe researchers have learned about the existence of dark matter.
Obviously, there is a gravity force that can be observed for the effects on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. non-magnetic electromagnetic radiation, and it does not specifically release or beat visible light.
Scientists have calculated that the whole mass of the universe is a good match of dark matter.
Tourists who were kidnapped in Egypt have been released
After ten days in their captivity, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed the tourists who were taken out of Egypt again.
The Sudanese kidnappers required millions of euros of ransom.
In the shooting before the hostages were released, six hostages reportedly lost their lives.
Five German citizens were abducted in South Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are underway.
Germans become the target of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE will report on the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are free.
This has been reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabija Arabic TV tax and the Italian media.
According to Italian Sky TG 24 television broadcasts, the Italian Secretary of State Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
At the moment, we're investigating their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian citizen, along with eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and secure - have announced the Egyptian state television.
19 participants of the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released continue to be clouded: According to a Egyptian security officer, the hostages have already demonstrated their willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisedly killed their six.
"The problem is solved.
The ransom was accepted," said the official.
"It was just a trial about taking hostages," when suddenly "a surprise happened."
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two arrested.
The hostages claimed a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over to one of the hostages' German wives.
The al-Massri al-Jom newspaper reported to a German broker that the release of hostages would go away because kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostages release women hostages after the ransom has been paid.
Men are being held by kidnappers until safe escape routes are found.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"Waring to murder" is the violence in steppah
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather raped her for years.
The 57-year-old Michael Trerise, living in the Cornwall County Stithians, spent six years in prison after he confessed to the attempt to report violent sex in the eighth century.
The Truro Criminal Court noted that he regularly tied his stepmother Stephanie Randle between the age of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's statements, she wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
It was said at the trial that he committed suicide at the home of Randle at 34 in the town of Plymouth, Mutley, on 1 April 2007.
When he was a kid in Coventry, Trerise tied him up and tied him up in front of the intercourse while his mother worked in a beer bar.
Trerise was divorced from his wife in the 1980s, and once again Cornwall was re-elected.
He moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turns out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at National Trust’s monumental organization, was persecuted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006 the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who was previously passionately fond of surfing and biking, said her friends, "the most emotional dead" and "said about life."
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had a conflict with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter, saying, "I've always tied up my eyes.
I'm not sexually disturbed.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're an extremely strange fetisisist, and I'm sure this was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim killing himself.
Even more thoughtful, though, is the fact that if it did not do so, the case might never have been brought before the court."
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to Stephanie's parents' view of the impact of your crime on their daughter over the years.
If this did not happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
He was charged with losing the important data.
According to the BBC's reports, the government official is accused of a breach of office secrets who strictly filed classified documents on a train in June.
The man was sent out from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the slightest charge of breaking the law and there is no suspicion of intentional crime.
Frank Gardner, a reporter from the BBC Department of Defence, says that the move surprised a lot of people in Whitehall.
"It was believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the case as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed has been charged under point 8.1 of the Act, this paragraph is about the retention of information.
The State Prosecutor's Office has proposed that the prosecution against the officials is represented by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive work he has done with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included classified surveys on the capabilities of Al-Qaida and the Iraqi army.
On Monday, they informed me of the decision and then moved her home to an unknown location.
Building cooperatives pay for B&amp;B account
United Kingdom housing cooperatives can count to over GBP 80 million after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford &amp; Bingley's deposits.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of deposit holders, including 59 housing associations.
President of the Association of Buildings (BSA), Adrian Coles, says that companies and members have to pay.
The 14 billion important loans will eventually be reimbursed following the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgages.
However, interest accumulated over the period will be charged annually to 700 financial companies using loans.
The CRS has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing associations are among them.
It is regrettable that institutions that have so far been careful ... now have to pay the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that all companies have to pay a percentage of what they own, which is the deposit amount, and companies share the cost by 18% between themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies need to put aside 81 million pounds to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Housebuilding Association, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is shocking for those institutions to pay the bills of institutions with a much less prudence, which went carefully at the time of the recovery of the housing market."
According to the BSA, no company was destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"In all respects, we need to look into this case in the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of money," added Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, a total annual interest rate will have to be paid, which may even be twice the current one.
Since housing cooperatives are self-assistance organisations, without shareholders, they will eventually have to pay the bill, either at higher charges or at lower interest rates after their deposits.
The price of milk is increased by fivepence per litre.
In Jersey people have to pay more for milk.
The milk company in Jersey has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by another 5pm from Monday to Monday.
This year, this second price increase has taken place since the rise in the twopences in February and following a survey carried out by an advisory company.
Resellers themselves decide whether to pass on price increases to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey last changed in 2002.
refused a request from a former Bangladeshi parliament to defend himself on the loose
The Bangladeshi court rejected the earlier Parliamentary Member Sheikh Hasina's request for protection on the loose, which means they can arrest him when he returns to the country.
Your lawyer said that the court refused to defend him on the grounds that 50 million coats were blackmailed by a businessman during Parliament's term of office (729,700 dollars).
This case is just one of the countless allegations of corruption against it.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Ziat, was released this month.
Sheikh Hasina has to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, Awami League, demands that the temporary government supported by the army of the country first give her full freedom.
According to the announcements, although a conditional release was placed to go abroad for treatment, the conditions for free entry do not make it clear whether you can maintain your freedom when you return to the country.
Your lawyers are saying that you will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appeal court.
"The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina's application for bail by not requiring it, for it has been temporarily placed on foot and involved in treatment abroad," we learned from attorney Rafique Huq.
"We will appeal against the decision of the appeal court."
According to your lawyer's argument, you need to defend yourself on the loose so that you can return to the country and prepare for the elections in December.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th.
Last year, the temporary government supported by the army took over the power, but in June he was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charges against them.
Problems regarding the vaccination programme against Afghan polyo
According to the United Nations, nearly 200 000 Afghan children have been excluded from the recent anti-polyo vaccination programme due to Taliban violence.
Last week, UN in six provinces organized vaccination.
However, they said that for safety reasons they could not get to children living in certain parts of Helmand and Kandahar, south.
According to a UN speaker, all this happened even though the Taliban made a promise: they will not attack or prevent the work of thousands of staff carrying out vaccination.
BSkyB’s appeal regarding ITV was rejected
BskyB’s appeal was dismissed against the decision of the Competition Committee, which instructed him to reduce his interest in the rival TV station in ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court required BSkyB to reduce its share of 17.9% to 7.5% in ITV.
Earlier, the Committee concluded that BSkyB’s share would hinder competition and lead to unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB purchased its share in 2006 and thus effectively prevented NTL, which has since been transferred to Virginia Media, in the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that the share purchased by BSkyB from ITV would jeopardise ITV’s independence, encouraging the Competition Committee to launch an investigation.
The director of Virginia, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's supervision were all opposed to buying.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of ITV’s participation would be pointless and disproportionate, in particular that BSkyB declared that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Further investigation of US prosecutors' case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the loss of nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The step followed by criticism of the decisions of the government officials by the Chief Inspector General of the Court of Justice.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the lawmakers and the former chief state attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state prosecutors had been killed for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, Special Prosecutor, will now examine whether the officials who were heard during the investigation have tried to stop justice by lying.
"The serious allegations of possible crime have not yet been investigated, and it has not been clarified," said Chief Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of the main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power of requiring witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine state prosecutors from the U.S. judicial register in December 2006.
At that time, they said that the state prosecutors were released because of their poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the state prosecutors who had been expelled did not get any worse evaluation than many other colleagues, and many of them came to the conclusion that there was political consideration behind the dismissals.
Some prosecutors took part in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican Congressmen, while others refused to participate in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against the Democrats.
The U.S. attorneys are investigating the government and conducting court cases.
They can be lost at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
Alberto Gonzales, then's head of the court register, became the target of the main state prosecutor's attacks on the loss of life, and finally resigned.
A number of other civil servants of the Court have also given up their resignation.
In his report, Chief Inspector Gonzales was highly critical of his role in the matter. He said that the main state attorney was "first responsibility" for dismissals, "responsible" roles, and "extracted" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former Bush, are judging by the lack of cooperation during the investigation.
Meat Loaf’s Eposa gets credit for
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition from the Q Awards award-winning gala for "Bat Out Of Hell"'s epicussic hymnus.
The singer who next week takes over his special gold prize at the London ceremony said he considered it an honor.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song, Meat Loaf, 1977, was titled by the album of the public-scraping garden.
Coldplay received most of the entries for this year's awards, in four categories they entered the candidate list.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the limits of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" like this."
Jim Steinman's song required a very big voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song started with an almost two-minute musical specialist.
It appeared as a single plate in 1979, and it reached 15th in the Slaglers.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been present for almost nine years on the Slaverlists, and after that, over 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf - the real name is Marvin Lee Aday - has recently suffered from health problems. Among other things, he had surgery due to heart rhythm disorder in 2003, after falling on the stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel some concerts because of acute encephalitis.
Later it turned out to be a cyst on his voice.
Unknown large city street, which is often forgotten, and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of beamways, tours, and other side roads, some of which are famous, others only perform practical functions.
However, many trained cab drivers and long-term local residents can easily tell you where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The little street is in East Village and is heading north of First Street - without reaching the second street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more like a dusty alley than a main route.
No street signs.
In practice, you cannot find it on a standard map.
But the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, Avalon Bay, the building of the luxury buildings on the first street recently built.
He wants to re-trace Extra Place, and he wants to make sure that he can get to the new buildings' shops and buses in a cleaner way.
The admirers of the street include the long-term neighbors who were caught in the bone street, that this was the only remains from the past before the renovations in the area.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the building and development department of the city.
During this month, at a meeting of the Committee on Regional Management of the District Government, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal according to which the builder would buy the street.
However, the Committee would prefer the street to stay in the city's care and to request a new plan for the next month, reported Susan Stezer, district manager of the municipal body number 3.
"There are very few areas in the city already, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"There may be proposals for renovation and management that Avalon can do, but we would also like to guarantee that it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that she wanted to re-trace the little street and would like to be provided with seats.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the street was first announced at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, they do not insist on holding it.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to refurbish this ployed alley and turn it into a pleasant public hell", adding that the city suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the building conservation office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for building development and not for managing it.
Compared to his more colourful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place is not much of a historical significance.
According to some, in 1882 he received the name "Kenki Land" when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow range of land.
The punk-rock monument, the back entrance of the CBGB, was opened at Extra Place in 2006, and the street is perhaps the most embarrassing photo of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"It was a crime scene," said Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"He had garbage, clothes, barrels, posters, and wood leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they owned East Village in the middle class, oppose the sale of Extra Place.
Others refer to Extra Place as rare, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city and which must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of "The New Yorker" ("Siralmak's book "Siralmak's "Siralmak", said to his blog that describes the process of the city's death, in 1952, part of the story about Extra Place, which was published in the "The New Yorker" weekly title of "The New Yorker".
The author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is still dark during the day, which is bound by rusty, iron storage doors and spalette windows, and where the wind carries one-week newspapers in the canals."
Apart from a few exceptions, the street looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, along the back door, which used to lead to CBGB, and now it belongs to a higher price-setting clothing store.
It was graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0,75-litre beer ball was lying next to a dumped, fresh paper pile.
Some walkers told us that they rarely remember Extra Place, but they think they could renovate.
Fields told me that some people felt that they underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its present state.
"I spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, brittle and disgusting places," he said.
debate on bilingual education: Continued exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Observatory Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the opinion of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher in the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute and leading director of the study in California, is "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need a choice for school"?
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish areas.
This includes Barack Obama's proposals on education.
Obama's campaign says "the students with African-American and Spanish lips are significantly less likely to obtain a degree than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such differences in performance, Obama’s educational plan explicitly supports - among other things - temporary double-language education for students in English.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether its commitment to dual-language education, which places emphasis on school education in non-English, is beyond its interest in combating high performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep contract general school in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school's students are Spanish lips and low incomes.
More than one third of whom many have recently arrived, students learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results at the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Similarly, it is impressive that 93% of the fourth class met excellently in English language and literature exams.
This incredible performance is not achieved by the tool Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street places emphasis on repetition, exercise, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikkels, director of Sixth Street, the school educational principle of students learning English is "to a full extent" into the language environment.
The essence of the approach is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes double-language education, said: "We've had a very good success in walking into a classroom, you wouldn't notice who the student who came from Mexico 12 months before."
"It works," he said, "We're working."
Would Obama set a follow-up example in front of the other schools, such as Sixth Street Prep, that teach a significant number of Spanish-door and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear, but we cannot be certain of Obama's reaction because of its own party's education policy (the National Education Associations have long supported dual-language education).
While agreeing that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently stated with respect when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "only English" rule of law.
Instead, he said, "They should be able to make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, he should study seriously the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
The price of oil fell steeply because of the renewed economic concerns.
On Monday, oil prices were so steep that America's rescue plan for financial markets would not be able to raise the economy.
The securities of crude oil fell back by seven percent to $99.80 this morning at the New York Stock Exchange.
The prices have been down by over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the commodity stock was inspired by the financial confusion on Wall Street and by some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached 145,29 dollars per barrel in July, almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before being again affected by the vast uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, the concern revolved investors even after Congress leaders announced: they managed to agree on the economic rescue action, which is the largest in history.
The news was shadowed by concerns that the financial crisis would not be over for long.
In the latest event of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy up the bank business of Wachovia Corporation, announced the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments have partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital's analysts, as a result of desperate weekend consultations, "it seems that the rescue action has failed to revive stock trade preferences."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that the demand for goods, such as oil, will also decrease.
"The future of stock shares, interest rates and exchange rate markets worldwide has become uncertain", says Deutsche Bank, an analyst for investors.
"We also think that the market for commodities will not be avoided by "a pandemic".
From the point of view of the commodity trade, the biggest issue is the extent to which the U.S. is infected with the whole world, especially China."
As oil consumption decreased due to the slowing of economic growth, banks analysed their expectations for the next year, reducing their forecast for oil and gas prices by 20% in 2009.
The team set up his record with his second quarter bravúr
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played in a defensive end position, thought he'd seen everything.
But then he watched his second quarter development on Sunday when Jets turned a game without a point into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it before," says Ellis.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark clouds rising up in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown passport. It was a perfect forerunner for an afternoon in which their cooperation developed developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown passports in this quarter, including when two cornbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't feel bad about the trouble," Favre said about all the passports he gave Coles.
"Poco's a good player.
We've been able to communicate with each other so far, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, defense stopped the Cardinals' leader, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, playing in the cornback position, caught a bad shot and threw him back 32 yards for touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safe player got into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, lineback got Warner out of hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing mozzana in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely kicked 20-yard field goal to set the 34:0 results.
This was the best result that the Jets have achieved in a quarter.
When they asked the Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the hysterical nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When they told him that both of them - in the third quarter, Cardinals got 21 points that Jets didn't get one - Mangini said, "I have to say I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third one.
We've got a lot of points in a short time."
The rest of the Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
Etiop Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many people consider the best medium and long distance ever to be, when in Berlin, on Sunday, he broke his world record, and he became the first person to run 42,2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
In a comfortable flat track, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds of his earlier result at 2:04:26, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world order of his career in a variety of areas where he won world champions in almost every period of time from 1500 metres to the Marathon, or has reached world order.
Last month Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, which, looking back, may have been too careful, that air pollution would further worsen his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called me on the Berlin marathon.
Almost perfect conditions - day by day, starting at 9 °C and ending at 13 °C - won Gebrselassie on Sunday, with an incredible speed of 2 minutes at 56 seconds.
Since those who have not started on the marathon earlier, such as Gebrselassie and Paul Terga in Kenya turned for longer periods, the Marathon record has decreased more than two minutes in the past decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in 1998:06:05 in Berlin.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, his two legs were cramped, and he couldn't train for two weeks.
It's obvious that during the forced rest period he's fresh and not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie said to the reporters.
"It was all perfect.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but finally everything was okay."
He received some criticisms, especially from Kenya, the East African rivalry of Ethiopia, that he uses too much aid in his competitions, usually avoiding a lot of world-famous Marathon runners, leaving his armpits running like he's running on the track and putting world rules in front of the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's grandness in the long run.
Gebrselassie reached the reference point on Sunday, with the involvement of four kenya boroughs under 1:02:04.
Two live-on kenya runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi gave Gebrselassie the rhythm after the armpits got out.
Not much more than 4.8 miles before the target Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, who reached Kwambai in second direction with 2:05:36, 5 minutes in improvement on the individual's best.
Kamathi entered the third under 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, closed a remarkable year with his seventh fastest victory, 2:19:19.
The World Summit is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, won a surprise at Marathon London 2:24:14.
Because of the alleged back injury of the Beijing Olympic Games, he was unable to participate, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he fixed five minutes at his individual peak.
He won the competition with a smart calculation: first he allowed the Ethiopians and Kenyans to move forward with a group of four people, and to take a major lead, and then about 30 km after they ran.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa reached second goal at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya became the third result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of black people
In the Greater Orlando experience park - a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and huge - a quiet small town is hidden where the pride and comfort of African-American life has been born.
Eatonville, the first pure black city to be integrated into the country, and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, today is not as simple as it was described in 1935: "The five lakes, three croquetways, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmers, lots of guajavas and two schools without prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the Zora Festival each year, and the Evenville ceremony is held in honor of her most famous female writer, Hurston.
However, in many respects, the city that it describes as a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guidebook published by the Federal Journal of the Warranty, is separate from its surroundings.
He was as independent, worthy and close as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that Florida, urban blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people, who could "so little of us that they didn't know what they were missing."
Even the year that the black presidential candidate Barack Obama called for an open debate on racial issues, many people are untrustful about the looks of outsiders.
"We are very careful about how to say our story", reports the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"I've got to tell you very badly."
Eatonville has long been characterised by victory and fighting paradoxoxone.
At the same time, the historical model of the black stand, however, is a community of almost 2400 people where poverty indicators achieve double national averages.
Part of the literary node, and part of the example of American slavery, was created, sometimes looked down, sometimes praise, southern, city, black culture, which flourishes in the shadow of the oaks.
So it is not surprising that the inhabitants here are proud and protective at the same time.
The photo of Eatonville has been important since Zora, (this is what everyone calls Hurston).
In the books written in a sincere, strong triumph - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
The 5 paragraphs of the Florida guide book transformed the city, lying next to road 17. This road leads to a location of black history and human dramas from Florida's former forgotten center.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, whether in the drums, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote, "We find the modern public school right, the brown-based school with white edges, carefully kept courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares about, although he can barely write and read."
She mentioned her widow Dash's new husband, and she wrote that Lee Glenn is "solding all kinds of drinks and anything that may be necessary in temporary accommodation."
So, in a few hundred words, Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with autonomy, but at the same time also with illiteracy, remarried and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guide book presented it differently.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"Zora told me what she was doing," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoteing the tidbit songs that the men sang about their beauty.
He added, "These people didn't like it."
Hurston here is still remembered as the living Special, who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston went to town, he usually arrived unannounced in Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and long pants in a city where even people were proud of their dignity.
Most people were impressed, said Franklin, but a lot of people did.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," Franklin told me.
However, on the terrace looking at the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he said in his chair, "I stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that, along with most of the world, Eatonville was forgotten.
Although he was ever a popular writer, Langston Hughes' age, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived before.
There were no significant memories or great public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much the world was enriched, or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston biography published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
The officials of Orange County wanted to build a five-band road across the city instead of the two-band highway, Kennedy, which played an important role in the community's lives.
The expanding Orange has already penetrated the western border of the city by 4 motorways connecting the states.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still walking after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration brought an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950's, the fights on racial mixing have tasted hatred with the community.
"A group of white boys came over in the day, and they threw sitting on the side of the road with drugs and other things," Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died in this.
They threw a Greek dinny out of a car."
In a letter to the "The Orlando Sentinel" in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to introduce a violent integration.
Today, the inhabitants say that the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the balance of the Eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to killing them - that's what I remember - man murdered his teacher in the morning and the evening" - reported N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, managing director of the nonprofit organization called "We're going to find the community of Eatonville."
"It took me as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher, I mean, there were cultural differences between us," said Nathiri.
However, human rights helped in the rise of many other Zora Neale Hurston, black writers, actors and artists who went beyond prejudices, as he did, with so much self-confident confidence and lines as: "How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?
It's inconceivable to me."
In 1975 Alice Walker was pilgrimed to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to struggle to restore her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway, a well-known Hurston biography, was added to the shelf of the bookshops, re-emerged into America's role models.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter again became the center of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors thought he was a rescuer.
The community started organising a Hurston festival in 1988 to show us what the county would destroy its main route.
Thousands of fans arrived at the two-yearly opening event, and many have since returned to the ceremony in every January.
A few years later, the county stopped proposing road construction.
"As a result of the five-tracking of the main road, the community relived, turned on full speed, which means real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd made it easier for me to say, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
People living outside the city were more and more exposed than counsel Rachelle Munson, who began attending church in 1993 and the locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville entered the national historical list in 1998.
The new one-level library (naturally named Hurston) was opened in 2006 and re-enacted and renovated on Kennedy's radiation route.
Eatonville still has Florida's kakukukukukukukukuto: it is not only 10 km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a side street from the suburbs during the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(90% of the inhabitants today are black.)
They're still taking care of the outsiders who come here looking for something to say in the story of Eatonville.
For most interviews, prior authorization is required, and some things - such as the oldest fresco in Eatonville, which is painted by a white man and pictures blacks working on the ground - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many, including self-confidence teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to the lively red, fear that their separate community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the home town has grown.
In particular, young people are increasingly viewed Eatonville as having seen Hurston’s own species: wonderful, problems, and everything, not better, worse, just as proud, creative, patient, foolish, and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
A true civil tie quietly to Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to work with the local government or the police, after the graduation of college.
And it seems that the younger people also learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who travel here think this town is nothing compared to others," said Alondra Kenon recently after worship on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and wants some time to get to know his history, then it's a very nice city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If the tourists didn't care about the newspaper sales vans and the huge television projectors on Times Square, I wouldn't notice a storm standing in the middle of it.
They would never find that with glass-walled bee-shaped offices over their heads, bankers and risk fund managers, who have held New York under their control, have lived the most difficult days since 1929.
The couriers are still rolling their metal tea trucks through the streets, transporting the trays with muffins for the morning talks.
Men with Spanish lips are still poking in the blocks, carrying 50 percent of the proposed shirts as human eves, hanging through their shoulders on a loop similar to the yoke.
The office workers are still in line for their breakfast pastry at the food trucks on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to take a taxi every day between 4 and 7.
I didn't feel that there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I decided not to open a new bank account.
I was also deliberately planning to take care of it during the afternoon rest in my local account of JP Morgan Chase's bank, but there were about 20 people standing in front of me in the line.
Not in the bank account window where money can be taken or paid, but in the customer service counter where the older customers order a checkbook, tourists are asking for directions to the Macy's store and where new clients open a bank account.
Many before me - I found out later about Starr, the "sented" banker - they were in line with the same intention that I did.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money out of smaller banks in their place of residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money has been taken out of so-called savings (such as housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives and small-town savings funds that only operate in a single state and allegedly treat their clients as family members.
In the last year, 15 banks like this went down quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a equity of $327 billion, was admitted to bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers started home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, made up of $440 billion worth of savings, went to the bank rescue company.
The office and shop workers ahead of me, they took their money from another collapse into a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, the bank that makes most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple people in New York have become skilled in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman on the phone at the local Chinese store spoke about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and his huge-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if he were complaining to a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the caretaker of my apartment's uniform, 50 years old, changed a subject, not Brad and Angelina, or my food delivery, as we used to do.
That's what she told me after I went to the bank: "I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not risking it."
Musulmán's graves were desecrated while Austria went to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Austrian Party on the Right, and Filip Dewinter, Belgian Party, Vlaams Belang, participated in a protest in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, on Thursday, 2008, which introduced the organization "The Envoy of Islam".
They boarded up with signs of traffic signs that pictured the noises drawn by a red line.
According to the police, the extremists on the extreme right are responsible for the desecration of the Australian Muslim cemeterys, which took place on the same weekend when the extremist parties significantly advanced at the national parliamentary elections.
There were over 90 graves in the trauni cemetery next to Linz, some time between Friday night and this morning, and the police said it was an organized action.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as David's Star, on some graves, but according to the investigators, they were just trying to hide their extreme motives that came out of hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in some way to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that "they were deeply shaken" at the hearing of the grave disgrace, which happened very shortly before the Muslim religious month, the end of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting a conscience examination following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance is right-wing.
The two extremist parties, which obtained almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of the Party of Freedom and the Alliance of Austria, for a powerful anti-immigrant law, and some of their flags were stamped as critics of alien crime.
Mr Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Party for Freedom to acquire more than 18% of the votes, has also expressed the campaign against the heads-up and the bourgeois, as well as the dissatisfaction of food allegedly linked to Islam.
At the final meeting of the party in Vienna, he spoke about "European brotherhood", which prevents Islam from being strengthened.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of the legends and of themselves, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to the public polls and analyses made right after the elections, the change was largely due to the young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from travelling abroad.
Garry Glitter, a known rock star for rape of children, has been banned by the court from travelling in France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months to inform the inspection authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The Kent Police have received a restraining order on Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of evidence of the convictions of sexual violence against children against Glitter.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the Kenti Ashford Magistrates trial, but they were represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesperson said: "On Thursday 25 September, the Kenti police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court for preventing Paul Gadd's journey to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it was bound by the law on persons involved in the register of sex crimes.
It should inform the authorities if it intends to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before the planned journey.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
Kent police said they don't want to talk about individual cases in Glitter County and their possible whereabouts.
We found out from the Centi police spoke: "The Kent police are doing everything they can to protect children within the country and abroad.
"Our belief is that it is easier to control someone by not leaving the United Kingdom, because there is a comprehensive system here that we have in place that we can manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we constantly monitor the conduct of persons in the record of sexual crime and in the county in order to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the rape of a ten-year-old 11-year-old girl.
He flew to Bangkok after his release, where he should have boarded a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he was feeling bad and refused to fly to London.
Land authorities did not pass the passport check, so eventually they flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where the Foreign Police and Immigration Service officials insisted on returning to Great Britain.
Finally, on 22 August he arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the West London, uxbridge court, as he was admitted to Scotland Yard, in accordance with a court order.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for the possession of photographs of child rape in 1999.
According to a source by the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I'm not taking pictures on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal side" Günther Bauer Photo Art
No decoration, no hairs, no dancing shoes.
Masters of Flamenco, without the excitement of performance, to get to know the everyday face of dancers.
The artist, on the one hand.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And you can't separate these two sides except in intimate, remote moments, when you can take a personal move, you can grab the depth of a captured view, or you can talk about the beauty of the untimely, unpatched hand of the artist.
In the photo series of the German Günther Bauer Flamenco-peo, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, Flamenco shows its unique iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the growing international significance of the Flamenco Day, considers the creator, adding that Flamenco-peapple could be a "seller" because the observer sees these images as not a typical representation of artists.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and go after the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their personality and character are at the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an inner atmosphere that allows me to achieve the personality of the grandmothers of flamenco with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival gave impetus to Bauer’s long journey in 1997, where he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a record camera.
These portraits quote classical photography because of the camera and the subject selection.
However, the use of various statistical instruments is broken with traditional imagery and modernity. The following thought is faithfully reflected by Bauer's idea of the flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always impressive."
Not the dance, not the singing itself or the music itself, rather the personality of the artist, the character spells the audience.
In the days, the leading motif of works that can be seen in the El Photographed Gallery is the search for a meeting with the essence, the artistic treasure, which becomes visible through the manner of perception, existence and presentation.
The known shapes of the flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the names of this photo collection that will display six artists.
The project also became flamenco-anthology, which will soon be released with an album covering the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits two years ago for repeating the idea of the "Veteran athletes' portrait" series ("SportARTproject").
Although the Flamenco-people concept differs slightly from this, the photographer adds: "I love to photograph people, to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter time.
In my opinion, the most difficult art of photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you meet people, you mix with personalities you sometimes don't even know, or people who just want to take a few minutes to photograph.
But despite these circumstances, I am always trying to achieve my ideas as a photographer.
The exhibition, selected from the contemporary flamenco portraits, bearing the name Flamenco people, is located in El Fotótmat Galleria, under the heading ‘Alemeda de Härculesz’, under the heading ‘20’ of Alameda de la Mata.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "a sense of blindness."
The site and the action are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on the writing of a new novel.The novel is the lead character of the novel, an Irish nationalist, Roger Cázmant, who lived 20 years in Congo and Amazonia.
He also admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia event that his current work on the Literary Nobel Prize was "prepared blindness" and "all signs indicate that we should not write" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't, but I'd do it, and I hope I'd be able to make a point at the end" - "in these words, he closed his lecture at the festival of ideas, thought and opinion exchanges, which took hundreds of writers, historians and journalists four days in Aqueduct, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the festival of literature, and he also replaced the hopes of it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' "Our Common Friend" novel.
The audience received a thank-you audience after Felix Romeo. The audience quickly missed the hour, during which the potato writer gave an amazing reminder and a large amount of humor about how he developed his passion for reading from his special adventures and his desire for life; how to bridge the lack of inspiration with his enchantment method of writing, hard documentation, repair and rewrote; how the stories of Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas are based on his influence on his petitions; and what monuments are built on.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it was impossible to measure or demonstrate whether books changed our lives, but added: "I do not think literature is a mere fun or a tisquittal experience", because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked the writers not to allow them to be tempted and bear responsibility for their calling.
The weather in Pozoblanco is shorter, and the horsepower bullfights are too short.
The horses ’ bullfight, which was traditionally held in Pozoblanco, was deleted from the show yesterday morning after the future horse torrents found the arena to be unfit for the war.
As a result, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohriquez, Pablo Hermos de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to stay with the bull.
The weather events have been thoroughly torn up by the ceremony series, as two of the three events could not be held.
Saturday, the rain left me with the second bull.
The future characters, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblancó, would have fought with bulls.
So they kept a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, and he brought home three ears as a trophy, and after the sophisticated and ethical struggle he was put around on his shoulder.
In the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante's two bulls gained a lot of recognition and, as a trophy, he got a ear, but it was not due to his own performance.
After that, however, El Juli followed, who contributed little to the ageing of Los Llanos Arena's reputation.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience managed to get it out of the drift.
A truck carrying two tons of hash tried to escape road control
Four o'clock in the morning, 50 minutes.
The Basque Regional Police shall carry out traffic checks in the field of the administration of Armiñón (Álava).
The authorities are stopping a van in which two passengers are travelling, trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, was not noticeable at the same time.
The detectives were after the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested, and A.A.J. was identified as the Basque Government's Home Affairs Department.
The captured man is accused of drug trafficking and document fraud.
The case was carried out in the administrative field of Armiñón, where the personnel of the Álava Forgalmi Supervisory carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey me, gave up a gas suddenly, and then left the location of the check.
The detectives were in pursuit, and then the vehicle stopped a few miles away from the runway, and they fled from the highway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examining the van with the Iveco Daily brand, he seized its shipment of 2178 kilograms of hash.
The sharks filling the rear part of the vehicle were moved by police authorities to conduct a more thorough investigation and to measure the drugs.
In addition, during the verification, it has been demonstrated that the vehicle’s fake registration plate does not match the data contained in the vehicle’s documents, and therefore proceedings against the arrested are also initiated for the purposes of the infringement of a public document.
The Basque Regional Police is conducting an investigation aimed at arresting the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, has fled the highway and is determined by the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant A. A.J. was transported to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and the judicial measures were also initiated within a few hours.
Heather Locklear was arrested because she was under drug control.
Heather Locklead actress Melrose Place was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend because she was under the influence of a drug.
According to an eyewitness, he was trying to leave the parking lot with strange maneuvers in Montecito - one of the California traffic surveillance spokespersons of the People magazine.
According to the witness, around 16 o'clock at 30 o'clock, Locklear pushed the gas to the bench, pouring the engine, trying to leave the parking lot forward and backwards, and in the back he went over his sunglasses several times.
Not long after the witness, who probably didn't first recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he's worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress sat in her car, which partially paralyzed the highway traffic.
"He seemed like a Zavart," so the police took him to a special center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperating and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded, and the speaker also said that according to the first impression of the officers, it was believed that Locklea was under the influence of the medicine.
Locklett was arrested and under the influence of an unidentifiable agent, transported to the local prison around 19 hours, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a Sanatorium in Arizona two months ago, where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left)'s Federation to act on the Silva case
The Secretary-General of Gaspar Llamazares, the IU and the representative of the United Left stated today that the regional Federation of the evolution will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sport Council of the Sevilla Municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after accused of giving his family benefits back to position.
"In these things, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case is a matter of the authority of the Andalus organization," Llamazares pointed out the way in which the party should apply to the former member of the City Council of Seville.
On the other hand, the IU President stressed that, in the detection of any irregularities that have occurred by Silva, "transparentity" should be borne in mind: "Always IU has always been on track in addition to the maximum transparency of such cases."
He added that the training is part of "the strict ethical code also for public employees."
"Myal blood", the epicus of Garci
The work by Benito Pérez Galdós National Epizods inspired José Luis Garci, who quoted the famous anti-Spanish rise of the Spaniards in May blood, which, with his budget of almost EUR 15 million, is the greatest creation of his cinema.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the ever-awaited human flow and social analysis in his well-known novel work.
Over two and a half hours of May blood is presented in the cinema on Friday, and later it will be expressed as a Telemadrid mini-series in excess of four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of the literature of Galdos, has made it possible for him to make his childhood dream. This is thanks to Esperanza Aguirrre, who has been entrusted three years ago with the Madrid Province to make a commemorative film for the 200th anniversary of the events of Madrid in May 2. Garci accepted the request on condition that the story was based on the National Epists.
The 15 million budget was financed by the Autonomial Province of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci: he could show "the confused Spaniards, who were with the wrong leader by mistake, because the fight for independence has pushed the country into a huge failure by the rule of VII. Ferdinand," he said.
However, the director expressed his regret at the failure to calculate the budget of Alatriste or Goya's fans who kicked her over a double of May's blood, which was why she had to skip a few scenes from the script, which, like many other times, is noted together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So, he went to the usual working method of the reboot director, and he took the scenes with the actors he started testing before shooting. Casting wasn't, because Garci thought it was a "gatherer", and because, as he said, "the directorship is part of the theatre and going to the cinema, so we can find out what happens to the industry in which we work."
Many actors in May's blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not first step in front of his camera.
Garci, who can be proud of an Oscar award, believes that before the Hollywood Academy, Spain was nominated, namely, the May blood, the seven French billiards and the finally elected blind sundreams, "where it should be presented", he said.
Garci's film doesn't count for prizes.
"In your opinion, you'll be working for the afterlife, and you'll realize that only happiness is what matters, and in the end you'll be happy if another movie is finished," says Garci, with a 30-year-old professional career behind her back.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Livonian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A slave dancer from Seville calls a memory of a dance dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in Triana and moved with his parents to London at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
In his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for female equality, whether Isaora Duncan, Virginia Coolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddha and a vegetarian, and he fought against the denial of women's freedom of movement.
A dance and aesthetic revolution in war in Europe, his life fascinated Isabel Bay.
"I wanted to work with Peter Gambo, he offered me attention to Tórtola, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "It is not our goal to tell the history of his life, but to capture his spirit.
I thought of the addresses of his dances of flamenco styles.
For example, the dance of the butterfly is the dance of guaj or the dance of the snake.
"He danced sensually and others thought it was my style," he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary performers: Miguel Poveda is now singing Isabel again after the Open door; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with an earlier disciple.
"Matilde shapes the older Toortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the request, I'm very honored to perform in my play."
In addition to the production, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga music directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pajaro is a baton, Rafa El Viola, and Juanfra Juárez, who is "playing a permanent character with his love."
The play also shows much of the woman's life, who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and then goes to even distant landscapes, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to remember her because her personality had a great impact on her age, but these days she is no longer known and even less valued at her work," says Bayón.
The performance starts at 20:30 tonight at Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, "An newly married poet's diary" will appear.
The first illustrated edition of a recent married poet's diary will be in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation will be part of the series of programmes entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organised by the Andalús Regional Government Cultural Commission for the 50th anniversary of the award of the Irish Nobel Prize and the anniversary of the death of their two.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium are the closings of this work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize poet's memorial hall and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree". This year this year the exhibition has been open in May, and it is planned to visit New York for the time of the International Convention.
The Andalúz Regional Government Cultural Committee has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the reputation and work of one of the most popular poets of the Perdo Tabernero published and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso from a newly married poet.
Without Paul Newman, it's not that attractive America.
"God sometimes produces perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote came from the actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in the film "The Victims of Sensation," and reflects the shock and incompetence that Newman's death caused in the American cinema and the whole of America.
How hard it was for him to get Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
and was known to have been sick,
But even yet, he's got everyone killed.
"Sometimes it's impossible to express our feelings, and I just lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, "she's made my life a better place and this country."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or getting overboard.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went in a particularly dark period, which was shadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times are so difficult and many people easily lose their virtues, and there are very few people we can look up to, there is no need to be like Luis Cerda to admire Paul Newman.
In reality, the Philosophic experience of beauty and justice was illustrated in people's eyes.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a defender of lost and won cases, starting from the anti-drug foundation set up in the memory of the first-born child who died of drug overdose to the creation of a domestic bio-food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that could hardly go beyond its self-sustaining culture of nutrition.
The first wonder wave went through Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, said he was not a man, but an era died with him.
Another English winner, Sam Mendes, said that Newmannel's joint work was clearly the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy from Australia called Newman a direct inspiration.
"He made the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few who are trying today to follow Paul Newman's way of life: they require honesty and a private life away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible with today's media jungle.
Still, there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman is his role model.
Once divorced, but then he lived in a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward for 50 years, and he would certainly have had many occasions for integrity.
"Why else do I eat burgers when the fried meat is waiting at home?" - he joked.
In heaven, she may be proud that her daughters on earth are also fans, which is not so common in America.
"No one was as proud as the father, the loving father, the caring grandfather, and the devoted man-friend."
The road of Madrid's Olympic Olympics
Indeed, we have many dreams of a Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012 Olympics failed, it may be 2016.
But, I ask, are we really ready?
Because if we're out of yesterday's race, I don't think so.
They called it a perfect race, but in my view, that was the worst of the many I've ever been.
It was characterized by a block of nonsense, and if I had to be evaluated once, and I would be the investigator, a clear fall in the result.
But let's move in line and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the takeover of the serial number, because it had to come early.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at the same time (including chips, to avoid later jobs).
Well, that's not what happened.
First, only the number was passed (first nonsense, so just go there early) and (after the normal line of work), as surprising, only the S-shirt was (second nonsense, because I have XL exactly my size)!
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they decided to save the stuff and buy cheap little shirts?
But anyway, these things are still breaking off compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Besides going through the chip early in a terrible time, the position in the line lasted 15 minutes, and even the backpack had to be dropped.
The wait lasted for more than 35 minutes, which is inconceivable for a race involving more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the competition has begun, and we haven't sold the backpack yet, and when we finally did it, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made it even more pleasant to wait more than 40 minutes, which has been modified by attempts to raise people's lives and to attack them.
I think that by tomorrow, we'll get about 500 sure pneumonia, and some of us, including myself, will not get our position with actual time, because I assume my chip has been wrong.
If you asked me about the perfect race, I wouldn't happen to think of that.
So I think we can continue our dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) reception
Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a type of non-intelligent - artificial intelligence, which, for example, is capable of performing some basic tasks. For example, you can call a taxi (or a vehicle in Microsoft, a vehicle in the area of the company) on the basis of information from the conversation.
This "reception" is a camera and a form- and facial recognition system that can detect how many are in the room, who are - and indeed, note what clothes they wear - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
In addition, you can group those who are present on the basis of the discussions.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she is not part of the company that talks with her and is not an employee of the company.
He's asking if he's come to see someone and he'll make sure he'll be in a hurry to help you.
All this without the blue screen.
It's amazing.
But that's the music of the future, of course.
Currently, the company has more important issues, such as the development of a new version of Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people were saying that Microsoft changed strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and less ancillary.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers run the necessary programs instead of all the commercial trash, the machines would be five times faster - Bravo, Steve, that's something.
The Spanish wax has been invented, given that Microsoft has so far added functions and extras to Windows in all new versions.
Change of direction returns.
Microsoft is right, the operating system needs more and more background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I also joined the theory that Google made the first step to make Windows a competitor.
Many have rightly admitted that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be required, as it is essential for the hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to tell his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but you have to calculate the operating system with the death, not absolute, but in a relative sense.
This weekly statement by Ballmer supports this thought.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more web browsers.
The computer will only be activated to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and the time has increased to browsing than in the window world.
What is most of the applications associated with the system then?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 is less, so we're gonna have to have a lot less than Vista.
Less difficult, less relaxed, less complicated.
Microsoft's aim is to more on-line integrate its services and ultimately report an alternative to Google.
I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken at the beginning of the month in a collaborator for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster calls them up, uses the company's browser. - "Your browser, our future."
In 2006 an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for online browsing.
By the way, last week, the slide of Windows Mobile 7 was also announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, and more so in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to throw Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
In the end, the cell phone is more and more functional as a computer.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
That's what Pablo Picasso wore in the diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick Véres, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Cross-Down, as well as one of the basic clothes of this hot gay customer community.
And if we're already on the list of specialties, we can even remember the peaceful figure of the weight gainer of the kackias of the migratory circus.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, "tank", as the English lips call it, but no rivals of Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete with Fabuleux.
First of all, it's an elegant name - although it's only called "Marcel" among friends - which it can be thanks to the sport, according to legend, Marcel Cerdan's boxer, Edith Piaf's singer's lover.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex design, unique empathy and small (to be recognized) Belgian flag are among its competitors. The latter is carried by the most typical models in the neck of the shirt.
But Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sporttops, retro boxers, cashmere curtains, wool pants, seakeepers, dolls, minisorts - and we could also list - all of the company's products.
And they're all in the category of comfortable underdress,
Although it's unfortunate to wear them as underpants.
They're too good for that.
"I would like to be a young mother; no matter who the father is."
It is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but he's full of energy.
At present, the Cruz sisters want to play a more important role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means much more than giving some pretty and beautiful girls their name to something.
This was the promotion of Mango's new office in Paris and the transfer of the highest fashion fees sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's a flood of warm and gentleness.
What are you doing in Paris?
We present Mango's new autumn and winter collection, designed by my brother, Pennapo. In addition, we participate in the publication of Mango Fashion Awards 2 and in the gala for Valentino in the Opera.
It's quite a busy day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango, where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; that's where we took a lot.
And then, many times, I just walk into town and watch the women dress up, see how they shape and sort their clothes - it's one of my favorite times.
You work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer, and you're a versatile woman, right?
That's what I think, but after all, these three things are related, because there are a lot of common points in them.
Even when I was a kid, I was looking forward to going to my grandmother's, and in my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you on the Khanan, almost got up with a theme park.
And then, as a dancer, I've always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own styles for classes and rehearsals so we can have a good time looking into the mirror.
And in your acting role, you really identify yourself with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is related to everything, and I respect the designers and their expertise.
You recently celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the '30s.
I think that women are really worth it by now, they've had enough experience, and they've made less mistakes in life.
The biological clock doesn't bother me.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been doing what I feel like, and it's filled with great happiness inside.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother, because I was born a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
And as for the future father, no matter who he is.
I want to raise my child with happiness and great love.
Let's just drop a few words about the movie, and you've been filming several films last year, and they haven't even shown up.
Yeah, and I can't wait to get out.
I, who started in theater, am very patient and restless, want everything right away, but of course I know it's impossible.
I look forward to showing you the final hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you say to them.
Well, I understand that you've been doing debuting with Naomi Campbell on the runway for a few days.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
Naomi Campbell has been known for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which she arranged for an organization called a better world. I chose two Mango collections.
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
There's so much they're putting together, so I know about it, and I can make sure half of it's not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked me to do the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I would.
If women living in a third world are at stake, I don't know the impossible.
Returning drunk drivers will be obliged to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior would oblige a car to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting after the driver is in his state or does not blow into the structure after three DUs.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the State Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will last for a year.
As the project aims to restore the market, the driver will have to take part in a repeated training course on transport.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Car Safety (FITSA) Foundation (FITSA) are involved in the experiment.
According to the statistics, 30-75% of drivers who have been arrested several times for drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, because the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of alcohol in the air. If it is greater than allowed, or if the driver didn't blow into the device at all, the system won't allow the car to start.
The cost of more than 1000 euro instruments would be an offence.
A study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of irregularities by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved by this rule every year.
The measure focuses on irregularities for two reasons: it is easier to prevent criminal offences,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce as the implementation of the legal reform is taking place in the normal framework, while the necessary criminal reform needs a basic amendment.
The instrument is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form of commercial form, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party to invite the system to be installed in school buses for a French sample.
In Mexico, in locked shoes
With English accuracy, at the time announced in the program, 17 hours were landed at 40 minutes, in the President of Benito Juárez Airport, Mexico City, the plane delivered by the Spanish Air Force, Asturias Hercegi Party.
The sun was already on the ground, but it was still so hot that we could only see the Royal Party leaving the plane using our hands as a blinder.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other senior personalities were standing.
A few hours before I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Prince couple were coming to town for official visit.
- Okay, well, there's not gonna be an airport transfer for a long time today... the woman from here or something.
- No, sir, the lady Spanish, she was only here for a few years.
- Yeah, or like...
But the Mexican press, it knows everything about the Asturias Prince's Party and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting for the airport hangar at the red carpet, the order created by the 27 sailors who see the protection of dignity.
The Prince appears smiling, in the sea blue dress, and then the Princess, the long hair is caught in the wind, in remanded clothes, but not in the usual shoe that flashes to the toes, perhaps warned that Mexico City was being threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras and then enter the room where the official reception follows.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are expected to be a reporter of a vocabulary of Mexican television.
The most valuable fashion fee
The best place to deliver a fashion prize is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and coolest of fashion designers today, Valentino.
Mango has recently announced the second award of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards aimed at internationalising young talent in fashion.
The grand prize is 300.000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the first competition winner of Belgium, however, saw his own design clothes in Haussmann 54 in the Paris boulevard, and little eased his influence.
By the way, this company has its second largest European business and has recently been opened on 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is located in London.
We finally found ourselves in a luxury dinner in the Garnier Opera of Paris in the middle of the presentations of the event and the presentation of the jury for Valentino.
In Chagalok, the president's table made by the Galavacsora Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a difficult heart and sorrow due to her recent death, wore one of the Company's pieces and some breathtaking relief from ELAH.
Andik, Mango's owner and host had fun for the guests, and with baroque Rotchill, they were so knightly at school that they eventually stayed undressed because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own design pants and shirt, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At the night of her opera visit to Gaya Toledo, she got into the ballet room so she fell asleep in the old days with one of the poles and a grand plie.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace tour, but before that, he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we could enjoy Oliver Martinez - he's going to be two meters high and motor - and John Travolta arrived at the Parise Intercontinental. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he was good to say that he didn't want any scent in the room.
Stars under Paris' starry sky.
Oh là là, c'est la take.

♪ Who talk in their dreams ♪
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not thinking about people who get angry and are completely alert about what happened to them that day, but about those who talk during their sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it's actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
Very common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more people have been told that he spoke at night.
Its frequency may be completely rapsodical (for example, one with a high fever) or more systematic (daily, weekly or monthly) and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
The display cannot be traced back to one of the triggers.
Often, with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night alarms, night bedbaths (enuresis nocturna) or sleepiness, but this is neither lawful.
As mentioned above, a condition with high fever, or even with stress or increased excitement, may be accompanied.
In any case, it has been limited.
The intensity of speech also varies greatly.
It may be quiet, calm, can be incontroverted by words, morming, but unlike all of them, it may occur in the form of shouting, crying, or speaking longer.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to monitor the child and the specialist. The study may reveal whether there is a problem that causes great anxiety in the background and thus may provide solutions.
As mentioned above, there is no cure, therefore, unless there is any other, manageable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
But there are some things we can do, and here is a bouquet of preventive measures:
Be careful to remain calm before the child sleeps.
Choose comforting games and avoid watching children’s scary or aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or are more relaxed, we teach some relaxation methods to find inner peace easier.
It helps the child to sleep more calmly.
If you're still talking while you're sleeping, we're trying to keep the rest of your life.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day you will remember nothing.
Efficient advice
Don't wake the child up.
I mean, it wouldn't matter, 'cause the kid's not aware, but he'd get out of bed.
Even though he talks, he's actually going to sleep and rest.
Remember, if there is often intense anxiety accompanied by a phenomenon, to turn to an recommended specialist, or to discover what causes a child to experience a great deal of anxiety.
If you speak understandably (this is the rarest case), don't start asking questions to find out anything about it.
It would be unnecessary, for it is not so conscious of sleeping that it gathers its thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you can't see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what people have heard and the conclusions.
Never tell the kid they can ask about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
That's a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry about it, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally, the Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new boost and won again on the Hungarian track.
Although there was no greeny match, the yellow-blacks were in multiple situations, one of which could eventually win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had a hard time feeling the right rhythm.
The captain of the guest team was accompanied by Kauffmann, but the remote ball had just touched the upper corner of the gate tree. Then the Illhaeusern took the upper hand and followed one another: Fonderflick tried with a remote shot and then Hind's shooting went up the gate. Romain spiccel, Diebold also attempted to promote Dannemarie's defense by a distant attempt.
On the other side, players are protected in a block on the middle track, and only the heir Riahi is in a shooting position.
The beginning of the second half promised to be crucial: Riahi and Temporale were first in position on Dannemarie's side. Immediately after the first goal of the shooting of Diebold, the ball was taken out by the excellent location of the kelhaeuserni Marais and then brought it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern’s goalmaker could not have enjoyed the glory for a long time: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the track, so his teammates had to continue their struggle in a humanitarian crisis.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, couldn't take advantage of his advantage: they didn't cause much trouble for the home team, who just got a little further back to strengthen their defenses. Only the last seconds kept some excitement when the ball was very close to the gate.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a way out to Bretagne.
On Monday, the demonstration held by fishermen reduced the traffic of several ports of breton and normann. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the protestors.
They promised the president to be accepted in a constructive spirit and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with concrete suggestions.
The Presidency's visit coincides with the meeting of the "dangerous committee" established by the British fishermen in order to initiate an action against the rise in the price of gas oil, since the oil price exceeded the average price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to David Martinon, the president of the Republic said that "the President will discuss with fishermen what solutions could help businesses regain their competitiveness and make it safer for seafarers to work and pay".
The fishermen are determined to await the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
In the morning in Morbihan and Calvados county, traffic accelerations have been conducted, causing nearly 10 km of congestion.
The carriage of Quiberon's yacht was also reduced, but the roads leading to Belle-île were not closed.
They've placed roadblocks on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, sailors have already made their determination. Then, at dawn, tyres and pallets were set on fire before the fuel warehouses of the port of Brest, while protests were held in Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic Coast and La Manche. In Vendée County, the Sables d'Olonne, for example, the fishermen did not board a boat, while in Le Havre some 20 ships were blocking the traffic of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turbale and Le Croisic, located in the Loire-Atlantique County, closed their huge total oil refining block in Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided, however, to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the Ministry by decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the Committee of the Regions must decide on its next step and on its participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some Norwegian fishermen do not wish to have their interests represented by the heads of the national fisheries committee, as they did not support their efforts.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not allow their demands" and "will not travel to Paris" announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the fishing committee in Lorient.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes for gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents for their litres, but they believe that the operation of a ship would only be profitable if the price of gas oil fell by EUR 0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is an unforgettable title role in the home of Connecticut, after death and cancer at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have respected their respect for the movie legend and professionalism of the 83-year-old actor Paul Newman.
Embraer does not change its 2008 shipping plans
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian airline is planning to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, is able to keep the plans, and in 2008 he plans to deliver 215 aircraft - confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, Chairman of the company.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is very significant in terms of the Chinese market, in particular with regard to 30-120 mobile aircraft.
Embraer has been delivering a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers for eight years.
More than 15% of AIG's assets would be sold
The American International Group of Financial Institutions wants to sell more than 15% of its assets, so that it can pay back $85 billion before, announced the Dominical expenditure of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and American pension insurance activities, AIG would choose a large part of all other businesses - the newspaper, which quoted funds close to the case.
According to the Times, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday night to examine the potential for sales.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The asset portfolio intended to be sold by AIG includes the aircraft leasing company International Lees Financial Corp, the 59% share of the Trans-Atlantic Holdings reinsurance company, and the portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, added the Times.
According to the paper, however, there is no final decision on sales yet.
AIG needs to quickly get liquid assets to repay the USD 85 billion loan approved by the US Government, thereby taking the risk of becoming up to 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders in a corresponding proportion.
The Paris Historique Study on the Morning Meeting of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which has never seen a nearly 800 accurate reductions) and Nasdaq fell by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) was down by 777,68 points, and it closed at 10 365,45 points.
The largest decline in the index (688.81 precisely) was registered on 17 September 2001, when trade started after 11 September the terrorist attack.
Nasdaq, built mainly on technology papers, closed at 1, 983,73 points, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500 increased index by 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1, 106,55 points according to official closing data.
Wall Street's stock exchange has weakened even when it was opened, and then when the Senate suddenly rejected the market-balance recovery plan, it started to fly deep.
By 228 'no' votes against 205 'yes', the Members refused to provide the funds requested by the Minister for Finance Henry Paulson.
The plan was revealed by the Republicans in nearly two thirds.
"This is where the market has been filtered down with bad signals, because Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial Analyser.
"It seems to me that he added, and then expressed his concern that if a few days later such a plan was adopted, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is really condemned (...), then the Fed (American central bank - the tool) and the other central banks will be the line to deal with the crisis and the lending conditions will continue to grow." - warns Brian Bethune, head of Global Italy.
To further enhance the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "every day, a new and new financial institution is failing" in the United States.
After the D.C. Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking branches were purchased by its rival, the Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which required emergency measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that on the market, "not only the US but the global crisis has been created", adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market is very well-known.
The yield of 10-year-old state bonds fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday night, and its 30-year-olds fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first TV duel
On Friday, the two American presidential candidates followed another debate that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the duel.
Surprisingly, both the Republican and the Democratic campaign were responsible for the victory in the TV party that was followed by a third of American households.
According to David Gergen's political analyst, although John McCain's action was respectable, it did not prove to be very impressive enough to stop the loss of popularity: it is proved by five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrats are more involved in the fight: according to the results published on Saturday in the public opinion poll, Obama has a five-point advantage against McCain (44% and 49%).
According to 39% of those who have been asked to win, while 25% of them count on McCain's victory according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage by his partner, Joseph Biden, who promises to be a great Thursday.
However, Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be a good idea to underestimate Palint.
You have good feelings."
McCain, who has been in his 70s, has never had much to do with putting his own, undisputedly huge foreign policy experience, emphasising his opponent's 'navigation' on these issues, which were at the centre of their first personal meeting.
"It seems Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." "There have been several attacks.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to hold presidents" -" said McCain.
This is the main attack surface that has been used by Republican TV ads since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represented the future.
He did not allow himself to be disturbed: he mixed up and put it exactly.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, yet Obama has already done so" - he cut back this weekend's democratic advertisement, which brings the Republican leader's eyes to the fact that he still hasn't assessed the impact of the crisis on the American 'outca's people.
"In 90 minutes of the debate John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said yesterday, in front of 20,000 people in North Carolina, who were gathering for the election meeting in the rain.
Even the words "medium class" or "workers" have not been dropped out of his mouth. The confusing situation in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, which the Americans think is best placed to save the economy at the edge of the collapse.
"The next seven turning points could prove to be," he said yesterday, Charles Schumer, the powerful Democratic Senator.
According to one of the veterans of the Clinton government, Rahm Emanuel Democratic, Obama has "as great instincts in the field of the economy" as Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
In view of the current crisis in the presidential candidates, "the final judgment over the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinos Senator has again confirmed that despite fluctuations in stock exchanges, he will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that his primary objectives include the creation of the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain's planning to install 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidencies carefully excluded issues relating to a bank rescue plan of $ 700 billion (€470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night by the extremely unpopular plan.
Minsk: "Did you notice that the election took place here?"
Young people and opposition groups pointed out on Sunday night at the capital square of Belarus to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday night after the closing of the polls, hundreds of Belarus gathered together in the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of the election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young protests against President Alexandr Lukashenko say, "Dictator, stop!"
Some people admit they didn't even go to vote, "Why would I go?" They do what they want to do with my vote?" says a young man.
The protestors do not believe that the regime that sought to show itself well in front of foreign observers in order to connect with the European Union would be ready for a democratic system change.
If the elections were considered clear by observers, they would be able to eliminate sanctions against the country in which 40 Belarus leaders were denied visas and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were held by election committees, and our observers could not participate in the vote counting," said Jurij Potyemkin, a spokesperson of the twelve parties, a very heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition.
"The changes were only nominal" - emphasises Aleksandr Milinkievics, opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The main thing is to calculate the votes and, in our case, this executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition come into Parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to Parliament will enable them to receive seats on television, to sit in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore act in political life because "a dialogue with the European Union should be launched".
In the same way, if our highly indebtednessd economy against Russia comes into crisis and we are not able to recover, we risk putting Russia under control.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid to accept the outcome of the vote as valid by the European Organisation for Security and Cooperation monitoring the election process.
It is stressed that the participation rate seems too high and that the extensive organisation of the preliminary vote ( 26% of the voters participated in Minsk) has allowed for any manipulation.
'You have noticed that the election has taken place here?' asks the leader of the Social Democrats of Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released from prison in August this year as the last time he was held a political prisoner.
No one stayed in the polls.
There will be up to five opposition representatives in this House, and those who are best suited to leadership.
The silence of the night goes back to October.
In television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission will be happy.
It's safe to be in the blood again.
The tenth anniversary of his establishment was celebrated yesterday by Hema-Québec.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people's trust, which was deeply affected by the attack on the blood that had been infected in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the country-wide blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply was infected with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general recovery, the Canadian government launched a formal investigation in February 1994 under Judge Horace Krever, which was designed to explain the circumstances that led to tragedy and put forward proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever's late report was submitted, a few ranges of committees were set up to design a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee performed this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood - care services were established in Canada: one of the Québet-services Hema-Québec, and the other one was responsible for all the other provinces and the two territorial care of the Canadian Watch Tower Society.
"When Hema-Québec began his activity in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in the blood system of Québec," she recalls Dr. Decary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the years that followed, however, we managed to regain people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and working in the field." Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the people in Québec maintained that Hema-Québence was reliable.
Dr. Decary, however, does not forget that "trust is extremely fragile".
Since its establishment, Hema-Québec has been applying the prudence principle since 28 September 1998.
During this period, several cases have been identified in Europe, where the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has also been infected - the doctor who has been in charge of the company since the start of 1998.
"We had no idea that this disease spreads blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, namely, if we are uncertain and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we must apply exclusion measures, in this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jacob, which causes a change in the brain, and thus inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we have not accepted blood from persons who have spent more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
A few years ago, no doubt, it was found that the disease spreads in the blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, a technique that allows a more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus was published on the market. This nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly detect the virus in the blood of blood donors and not antibodies against the virus that were built on by the previously used tests.
Using the NAT test, we could shorten the window history that keeps the virus from infecting until we can detect it in the blood with our technical means - explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced for a shorter period than one week.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk that blood donors would infect the blood cell outside their knowledge and that this would not be demonstrated.
These improvements greatly reduced the risk of AIDS spreading through blood transfusion.
Today, the risk of someone getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 and 500 thousand blood products each year, it should take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that now anyone can accept or write a blood transfusion to restore health - the number one leader of Hema-Québec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We'll never know what new pathogens are entering the system.
It was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Western Nile virus, comes into the blood with an insect shot.
That is why we have to be on the alert," continued Dr. Decary, and then stressed that besides emergency reserves, Hema-Québec should provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"The ageing population also increases needs.
As anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the stock of blood donors, as the number of persons in the network that are eligible for blood supply accounts for only 3% of the population in Quéci.
However, any healthy person, aged at least 18 years, who fulfils the eligibility criteria, can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because, for example, they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in countries where malaria is destroyed are not entitled to blood for a year.
"That's 3 percent of the reserve we have to meet the needs of the hospitals.
It's very rare that we're running out of supplies.
But we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the old ones are getting older because they can't give blood after a while.
But it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even harder to keep them and make them become regular blood ministers.
In this rushing world today, there's only one hour of man's time to go out and give blood," regrets Francine Décary.
Hema-Québec from a $297 million annual budget provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart keys, eyelids and skin tissue, which is used only for persons who are almost severely burned.
These tissues are analyzed, modified and frozen, and then placed at Hema-Québec, which also handles one of Québec's public stem cells.
The hair can only be obtained from a cordless cord treated as a medical waste that is rich in stem cells, so that serious diseases (e.g. leukaemia) can be treated.
"Some weeks ago, we celebrated our bank having been in our thousands of cord blood samples, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples a year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who thinks the nebula-scary eradication program is very popular these days.
"Many mothers are sad that they do not have the opportunity to do so" – indeed, because Hema-Québec is not in a position to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Labs - pre-final Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders yesterday at 3:1 on the USL-1 scanner, and with the combined 4:3 results it entered the final. It was the second and final final final match for the quarter-end and the conflicts to which the Saputo stadium took place.
The final golt Antonio Ribeiro middle court won the match in 90 minutes.
While the first half-time went off without gol, the second was found in the opponent's net of two middle courts of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino.
Roger Levesque alone from Sounders managed to play Matt Jordan Gate.
Remember, on his first match Friday, Impact 2-1 suffered a defeat from Starfire Complex in Tukwilla, Seattle.
The Impact plays in the final with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night, in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who got out of Whitecaps at 3:1, won 4:3, but the Whitecaps came in with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are still being clarified today.
In the nutshell - the winner goal of Kovalev
The favorite Trias of the Canadiens is waiting for the season to come.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn created three great attacks, and eventually the Canadiens won against Florida Panthers in 3:2 of criminal shots last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting won a goal. Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the match with a goalpass, which was the fourth victory from the six preparatory games of the team.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who obtained the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet" is a warning from the Russian player.
"There's one more game I need to feel really in shape."
"You've been trying so hard to get yourself out of it in the first third," noted Guy Carbonnau.
"But I think the final outcome of the game was so happy.
He's got a huge virus."
Northern Charest's ambitions
The Prime Minister will not rule out that the election will begin this year.
There was hardly any end to the Liberal Party meeting, Jean Charest, who was already traveling to the Québeci Jean-Talon, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (left) broke out to win at the interim election to be held today.
"Resuspend our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was put forward by Jean Charest at the meeting of the Quéci Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday. The speech was enriched with visual elements, while the president was trying to concentrate on the substance.
During his performance, the likes of "Moulin à images" were drawn behind his back.
The three hugely impressive recordings followed each other: barriers to water plants, mining, Québec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election times.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would no longer begin this fall, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "Secretary Plan" for the fourth pillar is the "veio" for the future of Prime Minister Québec, which is being highlighted in a "New Economic Area", which includes an agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and several agreements with Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (i.e. the 49th latitude) was often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches, but there has never been a presentation on this subject.
However, the Head of State has only limited itself to explaining why the North considers it "a treasure mine with huge potential". However, he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts or a specific priority order for future projects.
Only a few development options have been highlighted: primarily water power plants, forest farms and mines, which are further stimulated by the growth of the periphery countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
On the north, he was also named Charest, “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond”.
This area, which is two times the size of France, is our territory, Québec.
Not only is it located in us", the Head of State has repeatedly stressed that it wishes to create a national founder myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely determined by the connection with the North: the gold lily in Abitibi, the Québec design work, the James Bay...
"This is our future," he did, after holding a stage break, looking at a huge map behind his back.
A part of the North includes 70% of the Québec region, which Québec has always asked for, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a border for which there is no agreement for a long time, and if there is an occasion for it, the same resolution, on behalf of the government, has been confirmed.
On the other hand, "In the context of climate change, we must reconsider our view of the North" - said the Prime Minister on the North-West passage which is open every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the view of the Prime Minister, it is an important task in this new geopolitical environment.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Québec Government would pay particular attention to them and that the plan would benefit many of them, especially young people.
Two ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létournau (later was a Parti Québécois ungavai) have already begun their negotiations with about thirty local communities.
Benoît Pelletier also led the interministerial committee, in which Julie Boulet (Ministry for Transport and Natural Resources) also played an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a big meeting, not necessarily a summit, where "common vision is created".
Northern development would, by the way, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly" - promised the Prime Minister.
Jean Charest described this "virio" as being consistent with the ideas of the Liberal Prime Ministers before him.
"Just like former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development as a result of the challenges."
It was also one of the returning topics of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that Beauharnois' power should be crossed into a barrier to Adélard-Goodout.
"The politicians of our family, including Godbout who founded the Hydro-Québet, Lesage, who carried out the national expansion of the silent revolution and water power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to fight the future", said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he also quoted another true, conservative work, namely John Diefenbaker, the Prime Minister of 'Roads to the North' between 1957 and 1963.
In relation to the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam, President Charest pointed out that the deployment was planned for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I plan to be there," he told his people, and he accepted his statement by a loud tapsvihar.
The Prime Minister, who, in April, said that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably no 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this year in the autumn, which the law would allow him to vote.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was already full, as he took up duties at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at the Québec-New York summit.
The session held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to develop nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without thought. Here, in particular, there is a question of "creative ambition": the Liberal Party, in particular, calls for the recognition of "Québec's specific character" in the Constitution.
I would also like Québec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have the right to be guilty of decisions taken in Québec.
The opposition, however, was skeptically accepting the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of Parti Quebécois, Paulina Marois, re-emerged the development policy of Northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that took power in 2003 rejected the application of this policy.
If they hadn't done it, 'we'd be a long way ahead', she said, in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercury, who was elected to the vote in Jean-Talon today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"But we want it not to be a mere game of play," noted Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Creeded Country
Vic Toews, Secretary of the Harper-Cabint (and also Minister of Justice) took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada a "student" last summer.
So to reproach a woman who fought constantly for the truth and deserves all our admiration - that tells a great deal about the people surrounding the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, one of the Western countries concerned, who has not delivered his own citizen home from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
This government, which absolutely fails to take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of his crimes.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, refused to say its word and let a child's cat sneeze under inhuman circumstances.
The only government that makes a puppet house about justice while investigating a defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that the UNICEF, the Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also following Omar Khadr's return to Canada to receive a fair trial.
And our government is looking out for a tournament: it doesn't matter for him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed, and all the years of torture probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently destroying our rights, our freedom and our democracy. "Democracy": Harper unstintingly speaks this word, which sounds like an empty word from his mouth.
So the time has come when morals no longer exist: they can smuggle, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen according to the comfort of a government leader who has so far been a minority (and what can come after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found at a party that glorifys the Force, the Law, and the Order. They do not see that this government is placing on foot the values that our country has given thanks to the good news and dignity.
Dear Mr Toews, this shame is more of a shame.
Opinion - The Barrick Gold Orwell spokesperson
In Le Devoir's issue of September 17, a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director-General of Canada's Barrick Gold Mine, was published.
As a result of Orwell's reasoning, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has launched a six-million-dollar dispute against three authors and a small-paid publishing company in order to launch a so-called "public debate".
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in cases of defamation, is not based on justice, but on law.
I'm not surprised Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barney Gold to discuss the public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable sums on defence and fight in an uneven fight where lawyers supported by almost unsatisfied sources of mining are on the other side.
Otherwise, it is often used in such an uneven fight to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement that not only silences the opposite but also fears those who try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have explained his views in front of the public opinion.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is otherwise done, the controversial parties in Canada generally do not smitten one another, but speak their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open up her books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, publications, and pay for independent research teams that could have highlighted the question.
But it appears that Bark Gold does not trust the public opinion, and with a move, he misjudges the applications and letters written in defence of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could initiate a "public" debate if, at the same time, he ignored the opinion of this public?
In the head of the Vice-President, this word is likely to mean only those who have paid the bus, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is becoming a lot distraught.
In a democratic state, freedom of speech applies even to other people who deny it.
On the other hand, Mr Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because he condemns the gross treatment of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barkick and to rule, but this is done on the basis of civilised arguments, not by a trial for silence for many. (As regards the term 'public debate', the Bark Gold recently called upon the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to the surreal development of Garver, the Barrick Gold procedure is conducting an open attack against the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
In its entirety, it rejects the right to quote authentic resources, to debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis for spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada is only able to study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of today, who will take the courage to do this?
If Mr Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, this could be done according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada apply.
You have the right to respond.
In our university circle, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts for a long time.
In contrast to his claim, Barrick Gold's inexplicable procedure shows that there is no open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debates in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures that restrict legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street rescue - Democrats and Republicans agreed
Yesterday, the heads of the Bush government and the Congress of Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement on the economic rescue action, which has been the largest in the world since the great economic crisis in the 1930s.
The 700 billion US dollars plan, designed to contain the financial crisis that has been going on on Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
The essential points of the plan are: better monitoring of implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to provide repayment of government funds; new provisions to keep up to the level of the number of houses occupied by the lack of payments; access to the remuneration of the managers of the aided companies.
Henry Paulson, American Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. Congress and Judd Gregg, the Republican Congressman who attended the trial yesterday, announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day trial ended.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets", said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush government.
"We have done everything we can to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the Democrats.
"The most important point is that if we do not do this, then there will be a great deal of shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans," said Congressman Judd Gregg.
The trial was speeded up in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have an adverse effect on investors' mood.
The agreement was given a deadline until the stock exchange opened this morning.
The two candidates who joined the negotiations late showed themselves willing to agree, but they said they were not happy that the situation had increased until the end.
Senator Barack Obama owns the provisions relating to the expansion of the agreement with elements such as the preservation of housing or the payment of the heads of state-aided companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibleness of other people, it is not a pleasant thing.
These steps are necessary, however," noted on an American television show.
And when the opponent, John McCaint, another channel asked if he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, he answered, "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I've read in large lines is that it's something that we all need to digest, and that we can move forward.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion-dollar plan, taxpayers' money would buy the double claims of American financial institutions, something risk-free assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis that triggered the collapse of real estate credit. This led first to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage loans) and to the spread of other debt-denominated (trade) securities, and ultimately to the freezing of liquid funds and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was broken by a group of Republican Members last week.
It seems we've been able to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed to ensure that some of the companies in difficulty are better equipped than the government does not buy it.
In order to ensure that all Congress members are satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan which provides that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a 250 billion dollar instalment would be paid, which could be followed by another 100 billion if the President considered necessary.
The remaining USD 350 billion payment should be approved by Congress with a new vote.
In exchange for assistance, Washington will acquire shares in the supported companies, through which the profits will be distributed and sold after the crisis has been changed.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the retention of real estate covering the mortgage loans covered by the plan, and may also set the maximum level of remuneration and compensation to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
I would like to see the plan voted for today by the House of Representatives and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
The opposition to the plan was repeated yesterday, both among the Republicans and the Democrats.
"It is very clear that Washington will not hear your voice", announced the Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the House's Financial Commission.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that would favour taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a representative of the democracy leading up to a small assembly called the "sceptive group", presents things differently, but brings them to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel-winning scientists, wrote us to ask for Congress: do not hurry up and examine carefully which way he chooses" - said Sherman yesterday.
In Europe at the same time, it was once again understood that it was a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would state part of the Fortis Bank Group in the value of EUR 11,2 billion (16,3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has become necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitors at the edge of the bankruptcy after losing 2 million euros (EUR 2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis in secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
With the 85,000 employees of Fortis, one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"This isn't wasted money," said Dutch Minister of Finance yesterday.
"We reserve voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate right now that the situation promises uncertainty."
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be setting up a new bank that has been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the ongoing loans of Bradford and Bringley bank, of which the real estate loans amount to GBP 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would purchase the subsidiaries and client stock of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley after this Northern Rock would be the second bank that the British government has wanted to run since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Celebration from the acting idol
Some of the beautiful auric eyes say he had the most important hit card, others say he had the highest weakness.
Have you ever been released from a Nazi mirror by the yellow-mooned American actor?
Yeah, I didn't.
By his shame, sensitivity, and well-born talent, he also had a long - standing style of being a real mastermind of the art world.
But what a huge field he ran in!
Paul Newman died at 83, from lung cancers on Friday at Connecticut's estate, one of the last icons of American cinema's flower age.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who had been like him, and for a long time was considered to be a rival in the film screen. In his works he was more obsessive and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood is often caused by extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as children of the German Jewish father and Hungarian-born mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think too much of himself, which only increased his merits.
In the early 1950s, he studied at the Yale University drama, and at the Actor's Studio in New York, before he broke into the theater, television, and soon later into the cinema world.
In addition to being the leading driver of civil rights, in 1979 he won a second prize at Le Mans' 24-hour race. In addition, he was considered a sex symbol, although since 1958 he was a happy married actress Joanne Woodward.
Now we will never know what shadows the lives of this mysterious, closed, work-oriented actor who hated show-business. This remains a mystery for ever.
He was a man of truth in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the cinemators: in his great roles we can only see on the black screen of memories.
Looking through life's work, we've been through the seventh American art, and the cinema has been looking at continuous changes for more than fifty years.
We remember the yellow cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and the cold young man from his sensual wife, Elizabeth Taylor, whose role was the Tennessee Williams processing called "The Cat on the Hot Wax" in 1958.
From recent times, we can remember Mr Bridge, who is faced with his old age, not having his marriage replaced his hopes.
Paul Newman and I also saw a lot of other faces in his films.
Robert Wise, in his film "Valaki up there", launched Newman's artistic career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in his brilliant work called "The Big Bad", which won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen in his brilliant film "The Svindler" (1961) created a bitter, vindictive billiard player and returned in a similar role to Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money". In 1987, he received a single Oscar award from nine candidates.
Different times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
The period of his career has been metabolized by changes in ages.
Youngsters know especially about George Roy Hill's culture film "Regie Dunlop" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop is the coach of an ice-coasted team who is not working with very usual methods.
He was seen in 1994 by the Coen brothers in "The Big Jump."
Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Harming" was closed in 2003: this was the last one that appeared in the role of an Irish mob leader.
Unlike many movie legends who left the film screen relatively soon, Newman stayed in the light of reflector for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its chilling, polishing and illustration.
Bertrand Tavernier, French film director, didn't look like "the living movie of underplay": he thinks his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always kind to handsome Paul Newmann, who, for a long time, had been killed by film characters.
Yet, he had less and less successful characters: rather, he formed neurotic, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless figures, whose drifting and rebellion could be restored with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face — a truly obsessive and sensitive person at the depth of his soul.
In the 1968 film entitled "Rachel, Rachel" (the adaptation of the novel by Margaret Laurence Canadian writer), Joanne Woodward drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman.
With the film "Harry and Son" made in 1984, a memory of Scott's son, who died of drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's numerous admirer remembered the actor. A close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (who played together in "The Big Bad" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said, "His presence made my life better and the world.
The joy of generosity and existence: this secret was the vibrating personality of this great actor, which we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his comments on civil rights, the environment, independent film production and Hollywood's campaign are vague.
We've seen him smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods a lot, and he did it with a pretty bad mouth, even though at the beginning he thought it was funny.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to the Fund for Children with Disease.
Newman never sat on his beans: he was always committed to the profession.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following words: "Your father has always and always been unmistakably grateful for his luck star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a sample citizen, above all.
What have you produced at the Zuschlag & Tsai account factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and their partners are accused of fraud and other crimes which cause particularly serious damage in the criminal organization and which are committed in a manner that is conductive and commercial in nature, including forgery.
According to the prosecutor's office, the tender funds awarded were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often verified by unrealised accounts.
In total, government and government funds, some 65 million forints were transferred into the register of the Young Left, partly into the pocket of some persons.
The method outlined by the investigating authority was that the tender funds awarded were collected on the basis of cost accounts that had not been properly completed and the associations had never complied with the commitment.
The file says most of the bills were fake.
For these, the checkboxes were acquired on the Yosefváros market, and all the rounds were manufactured in Kiskuhala.
For which companies are to be produced in the name of the account, among other things on the Balaton upland tour to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to your last statement, you had to look for a bedside and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption, which was then drawn up by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour register, and the city council's calls for proposals.
Most of these were recorded by István Lados with his partner, András Sergi, who, according to our information, wrote the most necessary reports for receiving aid.
One of Lados' "students" was a beer house.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlages in 2003, the catering place provided a meal for the 90-person group of the Commissioner's Pont Association.
However, according to the company manager, they would not have been able to fit in at the same time.
The same was true for the better Future - later along with the forms and contents of the bill issued by the Third Year Foundation in the summer of 2002.
A Bedacsonytomaji pension was only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in one night, yet the account was about a hundred and thirty guests.
However, even when Pigal Kft. was also marked in his book, which, according to the information given to the prosecution, was not included in the book, there were no documents for the Better Future and the name of Hoppa.
The head of the company, Győr Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was called into the D.A.'s office, he knew immediately that it was about false documents.
"Our company's name and tax number are in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: For reasons of form, it is neither perfect that hundreds of people have been accommodationed, according to the bill, because they have a total of eleven rooms with no room.
In addition, he was talking about a meal, while their restaurant wasn't working long ago.
The zealous account makers did not follow the fact that the Budapest Travel Office, which they looked at in Budapest, only organises foreign trips, so that they marked bokull travel in Hungary as a service in the cash payment account, which also did not agree with the company's account issuance practice.
Furthermore, as has been shown in the investigation, VAT was included in the document when travelling to countries outside the European Union was free of VAT.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for a better future, because the company’s service was not charged by the designated 25, but by 15 per cent VAT, and the hotel’s employees only issued a machine account, but the invoice was hand-held.
In addition, the account was broken down by the "responsors" that, in the case of a company, road freight has been designated as an activity carried out - through the prosecution procedure - which was not carried out by the company based on investment advice.
In addition, differences in formalities - inadequate account format, not a real stamp - have been found that the accounts for the Third Year Foundation, the XXIth Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are fake.
As in the case of Camp Ravenna Bt. or in the case of Kuvanto, whose representatives denied that the accounts were issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters were not aware of the fact that HIB Kft. was liquidated at that time (2001) when a group of the Youth City Association was eating there, and therefore the company was liquidated - our knowledge - also denied that he had issued the paper.
Consciously stated
The other group of account issuers is those who were aware that they had to issue a fiscal account.
The Eséry Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the Third Year Foundation at the request of Young Socialists, for about four million Forints.
According to the prosecution, the leader of Collab Kft. was hired by one of the defendants, György Ludovic, to issue the final account.
He also cooperated with Zuschlagek, Biogate Kft., currently liquidated, which in 2003, carried out the Foundation for the Right Future, the Atlas Association and the Red Warranty Association with a gross value of HUF 5 million, with no real economic activity.
No money flow, because the bill is ready for sale, but the organisations have already forgotten to mention it in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing the account belongs to the defendants.
So, the contractor of Delta Trió Kft. was Kubatov Ivan, who was based in Budapest on fuel and vehicle trade, but was not located there.
The company also issued several accounts for the sale of IT assets in October, November and December 2005 at around HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft., which was liquidated since 14 September 2005.
This company was the manager of a Romanian man who would also have forwarded documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Kubatov, in his investigation, acknowledged that on behalf of Kft., he issued an invoice to Atlas, Hoppa and the Co-operation for the Third Year Foundation, and he accepted their opposition.
According to the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian stone builders founded the Fa-Bani Jos Faari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, and the defendant said that the reason they didn't get a job was because they didn't get a job.
However, the companies did benefit because, at the request of attorney Szente Zsolt, a defendant, who created documents for the company, he issued accounts for the associations associated with Zuschlag on behalf of the companies: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Josment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organisations a total of 15 accounts, worth HUF 14,2 million.
The D.A. considered that 10 % of the amounts indicated on the invoices and 10 % of the VAT hit Mr Kubatov.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to produce fictitious accounts, they were manufactured for the proposal of the Commissioner Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Association submitted a tender for Modern Hungary to the Socialist Party’s public benefit organisation, the Dances Mihály Foundation (TMA).
500 to 500 thousand forints have also been won, but the amounts have not been used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to find out, five fictitious accounts received from Work Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
These accounts were also found during the search for Árpád Kemecsei in his educational wallet.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the way in which the accounts are produced.
Interestingly, if you are the prime defendant, János Zuschlag decides that he will appeal to the veil.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he promised several times that he would speak in a comprehensive manner, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in the interest of the Socialists, perhaps a large part of the damage, and 50 million forints in return, and Zusi will take the fall.
Who, by the way, may have been offended by today's requests to mitigate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to place his house in custody, have been found to be constantly deaf ears.
While those who commit far greater damage and do not suffer economic crimes can walk freely or at least expect the end of the procedure against them in their own homes, they do not have the opportunity to do so.
The psychology of overlictism: why do we give out more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to issue more money to overvalue goods.
The foundations of this well - known - and seemingly irrational - behavioral neo-economics were discovered by researchers from the University of New York, Neurologist and economist.
According to a study published in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in a kind of competition such as eBay auction, so they pay too high a price.
The research tried to map this "play" nervous system scheme using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers participated in a lottery auction of the other group, while the functional magnetic resonancy (fMRI) method examined the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants were able to make money, but during the auction game, where the essential element was over-licitating the other party, the complex under-striatum during the loss of the game was in intensive operation.
This brain area plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system "comprehensive".
Therefore, researchers believe that the pricing of the price can be explained by avoiding the acute reaction of the striatum.
In support of their findings, the members of the research group's competitors have also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this three groups, he slipped against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group simply reported the real value of the product and they made their bets.
In addition, another group promised that if they got out of the game winning, they would get 15 more dollars.
The third group received 15 dollars in advance of the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in case of a lost auction.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was simply that for one of them the winnings and the other, the loss was emphasised.
However, as proof of the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team against "loss" were willing to bet even higher than the control and the "new" group.
"These results cannot be derived from the theory of any previously existing economy.
They have so far only explained the events on auction with the joy of winning and the risk of avoiding.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by having now reached a third explanation", says Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic fiction of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we go to a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned for leading causes of death.
A hundred thousand people have been treated for hepatitis at home, but only seven thousand people are treated, which is why: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The designation of hepatitis is a summary of various viruses caused by infectious liver shocks.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, characteristic of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and underlying diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses range in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the nutrient channel (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body vessels (donor, vaginal, saliva).
Travelers should be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis Symptoms develop two to three weeks after the intake of the infected food, generally with malaise, weakness, abdominal disorder, nausea.
After that, yellowness occurs on the skin and whiteness of the eyes, the faeces becomes light, dark color of urine, and healing may last for two to three weeks.
A million people worldwide die from severe disease types, hepatitis B liver cancers and liver disease.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected patients are treated with medicinal products.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if you are not treated, you may also have liver disease.
Most infected people do not know about their disease, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells nakedly, in many cases only the first symptoms will occur in 20-30 years.
Thus, early prevention, regular screening tests are very important.
In three groups, such a disease is much more than average: between people who have undergone blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
The number of patients infected with chronic hepatitis C virus in the world is currently 200 million.
As the disease may already be detected in a routine laboratory study, it is worth turning to a dentist when any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
In time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thereby eliminating infection and preventing cancer.
30 September is the world day of hepatitis, first organized in 2004 by patient organisations around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the importance of chronic hepatitis, development and early detection of the disease caused by the viruses.
Anyone who believes in God hurts less?
As a result of a recent study, religious faith works as a sort of painkiller, which may have made it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, studied how the divine faith affects people’s feelings of pain, announced the British Telegraph.
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were given an electrocutor while all studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the technique that's killing the human brain, it turned out that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for regulating pain.
The first study is in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from different parts of the university.
The test was exactly by strengthening a rocking device to the left hand of the experimental subject, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked the participants to look strongly at two paintings, the image of the Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, with the female hermelin.
The authors of the study hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would create a religious state among the believers, while the da Vinci picture was chosen because it was not too different from the other and restful.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while either a religious theme or a general picture.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of Mary the Virgin, they felt "security" like "regarded" and "relaxed," they were filled with peace."
When looking at a religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo was seen in front of himself.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who has been involved in the study itself, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including atheists, only the photo must be found.
"We should find a picture of someone who feels very positive about like a mother or a father."
Bishop Tom Wright, England, welcomed the results of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should, and in many cases, change our personality." Wright added.
After the excellent results, the question is that if Leonardo or a similar calibre painter show the image of the Madonna to believers, what would affect their pain regulation?
Would the sight of the Quality Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You're the one you share.
On his tenth birthday, you can tell Google: you can find at least as much in people's pockets as in the sky above their heads; you can see where they have vacationed, what trade orders they have and what they care about.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, according to one of his main men.
As for the skepticism of Orwell, they do not see exactly the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect more personal data from their users, and that is necessary to keep themselves in line with the original objective of Google founders, which said, "We're taking all the information of the world into the system!".
According to the spokesperson, after ten years of world-changing work, the company will only begin with the fact that they can handle all the information.
The question of what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt said he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "what do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would really fit me?" - But until then, software can't answer such simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware of the exact number of searchwords in the internet search, the IP address they were looking for and the page that interested parties left after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users, for example, can store their own surfing background history, look back at what they were looking for, by the time they were clicked, and they will generate a much better personalized match for them in the long term - in the same logic they will be based on the Recommendations that offer us products and services based on our previous preferences.
What if they use my data against me if they look at what I do? - Ask users who are worried about seeing Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company may be frightening, not in guilt, in fear of punishment, in freedom, or in rebellion against power in Internet users, causing counter-reactions.
It is confirmed, however, that all of the proposed terms are not only recorded, but can also be transferred to third parties where justified, in such cases the personal rights of Internet users are protected by nothing.
The most loud example of the past is perhaps a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google submitted information about pedophiles from the social site that he maintained to the Brazilian government about the Pedophiles.
However, Internet users who were concerned about personality rights could still be expedient in May, when the company successfully proved to be right in court against the FBI, with the EFF's electronic rights organization: in these circumstances, Google cannot be forced to provide all the information requested by the FBI in secret by means of their constitution, nor can it be forced to do so at any point in the future, either.
(In some cases, the federal government successfully fought for some 50 000 web addresses and thousands of searchers' statements, which were obtained by referring to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act adopted in the past years, but did not obtain the search lists of individual users and the full website and keyword lists covering two months.)
The assessment of Google is likely to be contradictory: those who keep personal data from being sold because they feel that their intimate sphere and their private life are abhorrent by starting to use Google's services and engaging in a rebellion against multiple companies in conservative imagery.
Meanwhile, the American gay culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists, the next generation of big companies, sees "hot corporation" in them, unlike rivals, Microsoft, who is world conqueror because of Windows, as far as they can fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not request user identification code in a way other than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, open, free, constantly kept source code and program package to be more accessible, younger, more cool than official software practice.
However, there may also be a reason that the gels can precisely see the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which is precisely one of the most commonly expressed keywords of recent years, the web 2.0 has attracted.
The web 2.0 is about collaborating, leaving clues behind and using communication channels at our disposal, and while they vary individually, the main thing is to show ourselves.
An average young number of social sites can lead to profile from Facebook to Xang; they can also be linked to other services such as Twitter, or to a list of music habits.fm, then they can be connected to tracking systems such as FriendsFed or Blip.fm, which can also lead to a blog that automatically appear on their latest photo gallerys stored in Flickr or Picasa.
While you can read about a number of exemplary cases that reveal: a girlfriend easily realizes the morning photo flow of the common circle, seeing that her cheating friend spent the night with whom she was or can fire a company's employee just because she describes her sincere opinion on the top management in her blog: a certain, private life concept has been completely revalued by now.
A person living an online life is one of what he shows of himself, and that is how we can state the basis behind the behavior of young people today.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid Google Monopoly, can do so (for example, using Google's search system, but not leaving a trace with Scrogle).
For example, the number of people who do not register on social sites with a wish so as not to allow them to be registered, can be replaced by alternative versions from Google's online apps to the image editor and newsletters, which do not bind to huge server parks and which do not create the best profile that has ever existed.
Public opinion does not wait so secretly when Google shows the whites of his teeth.
With the current value of $156 billion more than the current value of IBM (U.S.A.), Intel (€144 billion) or Coca-Cola (€110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services introduced in an increasing pace cause a serious headache not only for Microsoft but also for several other software developers.
The critical viewers, however, also find the opposite points to be alarming: for example, the senior management has totally rejected the employee's objection, after having doubled the company's fees, it has been too expensive to find the management of the employees' daily dinners, but it will also be removed in addition to the fact that Google was still running a head in 2006 before the Chinese government and under their agreement the company is filtering all the findings that violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds that no new service will be announced in advance, only when it is already possible to use, but it is certain that the problems that will be seen for months and years will move the world at a new point: while some people believe that Google's book and magazine design has reached dimensions that the company will soon have to face the U.S. Supreme Court, others will be afraid of the Health system, because we can build a whole health profile with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database can provide good raw material for the next generation of science-fi writers, the novel of popular Cory Doctorow, the Scrogled point orwell, describes the future in which only a person can approach Google with alarmingly well.
Two juveniles helped the odian double killer in the law enforcement.
Two youngsters were questioned by the police in the case of the ostrich double murder, and they were suspected to assist in the elimination of the crime, said the spokesperson of the Borsod County Police Commissioner on Tuesday.
Young people have now acknowledged the act of terrorism, who are accused of crime.
The two young people - according to MTI's information, two girls - are free to defend.
Punishment may be punishable by imprisonment for up to five years.
A suspect in the odian double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested in advance on Sunday.
In advance, he's suspected of murderous crimes committed by more than one person in the process of profit.
The investigation revealed that 23-year-olds had a higher amount of money for a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to balance his debts, so he lured his creditor to an odian site last Wednesday, where he killed him, and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man is premeditated to commit the crime, and that's also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
The police are investigating the circumstances of your weapon and use with expert involvement.
Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Stock Exchange in Warsaw for the purchase of the 100-dollar stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which the Poles made despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
That's because the stock exchange in Warsaw is in state hands.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the paper in a few months' turn.
The E15 Czech Economic Journal is new to know that the Polish offer represents the highest amount offered to interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, until now, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Ttransatlantic Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Exchange have offered an offer.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that one of the interested parties would be the worst new owner in Warsaw and did not rule out that this could lead to the abolition of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by market experts at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank, which accounts for about 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. by 13,5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
European newspapers leading up to their comments on the growing international financial crisis in Tuesday already mention the second September 11th.
The global financial disaster can be attributed to the President of the United States - the President of Rome La Repubblica - has not even been able to list his own party behind the proposed law, which is designed to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett's billionaire investor, it is more appropriate to talk about 11 September.
A part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there led the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress vote, the danger is that Washington is not offering a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger points to it.
Today, some states may still be able to deliver a rescue belt to the financial institutions, and with taxpayers' money, they can be saved from bankruptcy.
However, if even more banks fall apart like domino cubes, then neither the funds nor any new moves will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to go beyond their national self-loop and centralise the control over fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than 100 billion euros were received by sick financial institutions - the Vienna Der Standard reminds us that there are growing concerns that European taxpayers, like the Americans, have to go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously concerned with the crisis, which is sweeping the old continent as a tsunami.
"The savers" do not have to be lobbying for hundreds of billion euros, but it would be useful if they were to record it: in which case it would be reasonable to reach taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
Idealing for Dongo Flights in the Smart Car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid a collision if it was not to imitate barriers in the world of nature?
Like bees.
In the surprising project on CATEC in Japan, Dongo bees gave the strategic start-ups the engineers of Nissan to build the next generation of collision prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BBR23C bio-recycling system, a robotized miniauto that was provided with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
During flight each bee will create its own oval-shaped personal space, which in fact is very similar to our security shield - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research and Development at the exhibition.
It is important to have a role in the complex eye of the bee, which can be seen in more than 300 degrees in every direction.
To copy the function of a complex eye, engineers touched the idea of laser diameter.
This will identify obstacles within a distance of 2 m before BR23C, and calculate their distance, and send a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which will immediately transform into an action to avoid impact.
During the fraction of the second, an obstacle is detected, and the car robot imitates the movement of the uterus, and immediately changes the direction by turning the wheels to avoid impact.
Unlike any current system, this avoidative maneuver takes place in a completely impulsive way.
"If not, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto-robot project.
It should respond in an innovative way and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety shields, to a layer in which the collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect what a uterus does to avoid other bees.
This process should appear at one glance.
However, in a way other than bees, the difference must not be directed upwards, downwards or transiently, only two-dimensional, and only towards the radiance of wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless opportunity for bees to avoid other bees, there was only motion and acceleration around here, as well as slowing down as an option available to the car robot.
BR23C employ lithium polymer accumulators, which are easier and more energy density, which means that their lifetime is longer than that of lithium ion.
Andoh says that an instigious intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, even less to store it.
This device should process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to keep them and respond to the intuitive logic based on previous manor data, so he keeps using only a few dozen kilobands of memory.
There's no need for a gigabyte or a memory of a size that's just greasy.
This is the first step to develop an immediate exit technology that, according to Nissan's estimate, can be involved in serial cars within ten years.
Additional applications may be used to bring the unit into line with the GPS satellite navigation system in order to lead the car to the specified end-use by avoiding obstacles to the road.
He's named after the poison child.
A written version of the 700 billion-dollar economic rescue package for the purchase of bad bank loans in several instalments has been prepared.
They spend half the money in the first round.
In the Eastern Coast, during the further negotiations until midnight on Saturday, the congressmen took the lead in the debate around the $700 billion rescue package, which has been going on for days.
We have made serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Parliament, who said that only the agreement had to be put on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking of the outcome of the compromise, Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said that the programme will work and will be effective, but it will also require further work. Pelosi believes that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy's cart.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of Asian markets in Washington on Sunday evening (i.e. mid-European time, Monday morning, two hours), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock market.
On Monday, the House will vote on the draft legislation of the Economic Emergency Act 2008 on the programme, which will then be held at the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the White House welcomed the news of the settlement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
The programme is otherwise different from the original Bush administration proposal, which would have meant that $700 billion was spent on the purchase of low-quality debt-backed securities.
For the first time, up to half of the EUR 700 billion can be spent without delay after Congress is expected to vote on this issue on Monday, the Ministry of Finance buys securities with a lack of credit, and the fate of another USD 100 billion depends on the decision of the President.
The program will be checked by a special body, including the Federal Reserve President.
The spending of the other half of 700 billion will depend on the new resolution of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may use a combination of tactics: at the same time, you can purchase bad loans, mortgage and mortgage-backed securities and other types of "tendering" loans.
In the context of purchases and directly applicable, the competent authorities of the Ministry have been informed.
The legislation will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial wallet guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means to get up to $700 billion to the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether to buy the wrong instruments in broad terms or to avoid any systemic risk associated with their insurance or the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the introduction of the law as soon as it is signed.
However, the leaders of the banks that are waiting for state aid can expect that their withdrawal money, which is simply called a gold umbrella by the overseas slang, will be limited by the government.
The restrictions on payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limitations depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys an extra tax on the gold parachute, unless it is sent to retirement for the distributed bank leader.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will engage aggressively in ensuring that management money is not exceeded.
It includes the fact that existing gold umbrella contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme as such.
This is the first case in American history that there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs - he commented on the measure by the chairman of the House's Committee on Financial Services, the Democratic Party Barney Frank.
In addition, in the participating banks, the state acquires the right to acquire shares, so the risk of taxpayers is reduced, since they can finally win the transaction as soon as the economy and the saved bank are on the way.
The draft law states that during the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress on how to return to taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is to say, not to protect taxpayers' dollars - the Republican representative of Darrell Issa, California.
Mary Kaptur, her colleague, from Ohio, believed that the measures had been called upon by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices have increased further
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, by 12.9 per cent as compared to August 2007.

The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum by 0.1% compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing sector also increased slightly by 0.1% compared to July.
The highest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the increase in the prices in the case of the case of the case-law, the production of silk, the production of silk and the production of footwear by 4.6 per cent over a month.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase in the production of chemical and product at industry prices (1.6%).
Price reductions have occurred in petroleum processing (1.4 per cent), production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent) and - to a minimum - wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other processing sectors, we have measured an increase of between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In August, prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors representing a significant weight in the domestic sales of the industry increased by 0.3 per cent, mainly as a result of the protracted effects of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
Compared to twelve months, domestic sales of the processing industries increased most in the petroleum processing sector (32.4 per cent).
The production of metal-processing products in the sector was 13.2% and 11% in the production of food, drink and tobacco, which represented a decisive weight.
Price reductions occurred in textiles, textile products (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In the other processing sectors, the rate of price rises ranged between 0.6% and 9.1%.

Consumer goods increased by 0.3 per cent in manufacturing sectors, prices in energy and further use sectors did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy and further consumption sectors (16.8%).
Consumer goods in manufacturing sectors have been measured at 6.8 per cent price increase, with a 1.4 per cent reduction in investment goods.
Export sales prices in industry forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, by 3.9 per cent in 12 months.
In one month, our home currency declined by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, by 7.5 per cent, compared to August 2007, compared to the euro, by 15.9 per cent.
Next year you don't need a visa for the United States?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will take place on 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke of this in Chicago, with Hungarian leaders.
In his opinion, "all in good form now depends only on whether the electronic entry or control system is being built up overseas in time."
At the same time, he pointed out that the new system does not have an entry permit, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is currently negotiating in Washington.
You will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will be handed over to the Central Cross of the Republic of Hungary with the Star award and will hold talks with the Democratic Party Barack Obama and the Republican Prime Minister John McCain.
The bank rescue package consists of Barack Obama and McCain.
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, both the presidents of the two large American parties, supported the government's 700 billion dollar bank rescue package, but there is a politician who demands the finance minister's resignation.
After a few days of negotiations between the Congress and the Administration, Marathon was announced in the morning of Sunday: they concluded an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The crisis on Wall Street and the financial package to melt frozen credit markets have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain also claim that they are more capable of leading the country out of economic crisis than their competitors.
According to the latest surveys, once again, with economic issues coming up, Obama gained some advantage, the advantage of the melted McCain, which he gained after the Republican Assembly, with the vice-president of Sarah Palin.
Obama expressed hope at a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday that the law on the 700 billion package would quickly be adopted by the Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer protection passports he supported.
"We now have to act with responsibility ..." he said in front of the 35 thousand masses, your position, your savings, the entire industries, the stability of the economy.
You didn't forget to call McCain's economic ideas past.
McCain explained in an interview to ABC that "this will all be difficult to swallow (...) but nothing can simply be done".
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal contained the setting up of the Finance Supervisory Committee and the restriction on the termination of the top leaders, and he insisted on these.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a significant role to play in the negotiations, but he was in a daily relationship with the minister.
On Sunday, President of Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives is hoping to vote on the bill on Monday.
Seeds of the German language area
The camp on the right has become more self-conscious within the camp - thus analysing the weak role of the CSU in Bajora.
The sharks are ready for Austria's government to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German newsmagazine on the left, Franz Walter, the revolution in Bajora, explains the causes of CSU’s dramatic defeat.
According to the known politician, CSU erosion has begun well before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
For decades, Christian Socialists have renewed Bajoran - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The shift is also a problem of Christian democracy, so Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was likely to be almost ten years ago: a state party's undisputed hegemony of a party.
For ten years now, in 1998 CSU landed at 47.7%, first below 50 percent levels in the 50s.
This has been repeated three years since the 2005 Bundestag elections, so that is what has been mentioned in the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is a consistently implemented modernisation by CSU in the province, which eats parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the pace. However, there could not have been any consequence of CSU's loyalty to the electors of secularization, educational results, the introduction of East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bajora.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are visible.
The camp on the right has only become more self-conscious, critical, self-righteous within the camp.
It is also remarkable that in the last few weeks, the classical civilian groups have just gone away from the CSU mainly; they are free professionals, industrialists, graduate students and those with higher education.
Here, the CSU's support went under 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper "Who, with whom?" in the article by the parties deals with the confusing domestic policy situation after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the O.V.P.
The O.V.P. will prohibit the operation of the SPÖ in your home affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not want to agree on the coalition.
The election took place, now all around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the leaders of the parties have hardly allowed their cards to be viewed.
President of Wener Faymann SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties - this exists in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question is whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - with the current president of the OVP, as well as with an alkalinary - Faymann left it open.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molter course was discussed anyway.
Repeating this direction is not the case.
Molterer was careful to respond to the red bids.
As you said, there will certainly be no effective cooperation if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
To party to the opposition or enter the coalition, the questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider was again open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: Break the devil's circle of poverty, segmentation
Today, in Paris, the European Equal Opportunities Summit was launched, with France as the host of the European Union Presidency this year.
Járóka Livia, the Fedesist representative of the European People's Party, called attention to the educational segment in his message to a letter to a major speaker in professional consultation, which is one of the most serious violations of Roma children and also the greatest obstacle to their application.
The High Level Conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of the governments, the European social partners and the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations have been invited to attend the consultation.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, the Roma need to be removed from the labour market, especially in the wake of their low level of education, in addition to discrimination at work.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and as a result of poor quality basic education, they only have an insignificant proportion of them to receive higher education."
Járóka also stressed that, as fundamental human rights, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could mean strengthening the economy of EU Member States.
According to the representative, it is necessary to identify these links in the broadest area, including the Roma and not the Roma.
At the same time, the Roma student begins school as early as possible, with the possibility of becoming productive members of the labour market; through taxes paid for income and consumption, they contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma must enjoy the right of their EU citizenship to ensure quality education and guarantee the elimination of low-quality and segregated education", said Járóka Livia.
According to the representative, it is essential that the European Union's objective and action-orientated approach to speed up early school desegregation processes is correctly respected by the existing and planned anti-discrimination options.
"The evil circle of poverty, segmentation, unemployment, Roma children must be given opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen", said Járóka.
The objective of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held in Berlin since last year, is to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a Temporary Time
At the end of October they will decide on the duo fate of the lepered Huber-Beckstein
Despite the gross electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the discussions on personal issues have yet to be held at the summits of the Bajor CSU.
Prime Minister Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein remain in place, question how long the grace lasts.
The fate of the 17-percent catharbolic vex draw will be decided by an extraordinary duel on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the many judges of the couple have sensed: they do not stick to their chair.
They tried to relax the members of the group and the angry members of the base, who, one day after the 'bajor tsunami', demanded personal consensus because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, he obtained 60.7 percent of the Christian social union, even with Edmund Stoiber at the top of his course, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, he only ran 43.4 percent of their power.
For 46 years CSU had been a 'one-man' in Bajora, which paid 18 percent of German GDP.
At the same time, conservatives continue to expect a high degree of coalition in a key southern province for the Hungarian economy, in the future.
As one of the first signs of the transition within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister for Agriculture will also be located in the narrow detection team that will start to relax with Free Elections organised along liberal FDP and right-wing values on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange fintor of fate is that the Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber, was used as a double opportunity by Huber-Beckstein, will be allowed to enter the law on the list of Free Elections, and then treated unfavorablely with the big-breaking municipal politician.
CSU leaders are turning all their energy into some sort of stabilisation of Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber, the former head of state and former CSU, who is based on the background, will have an active role to play so far, called September 28, as the most bitter day of his political career.
Huber gave a few points to the CDU on Monday, according to him, they would have deserved much more support from the Brotherhood Party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the choice of Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel cannot be a Chancellor if the CSU, which played a major role in national success in 2005, is somehow not formed by a joint effort.
According to Merkel, the loss of CSU's soil will not have a negative impact on Berlin's large coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: it will not be easier to deal with the wounded CSU, and the crisis of social Democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved its weakest score since 1946 in Bajoran.
Lukashenko equation: 110-0
There was no opposition to the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this Aleksandr Lukashenko led the country with welfare and stability, but according to the European Organisation for Security and Cooperation (EBESZ), it can be explained by the illegalities of the vote counting.
The OSCE sending 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although hundreds of ten citizens in the ten million countries have been unanswered for a long decade, the opposition, as the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), before yesterday's elections, was seriously hoping that, following the amendment of the Constitution, Lukashenko, who will renew his presidency's mandate for the 2006 clean elections four times as well, will "reform" some opposition representatives in Parliament.
The ODSZ also stopped from having a pre-arranged ankle.
In the background of the opposition expectations, Belarus, which has borrowed from Russia, which is economically increasingly dependent on Russia, to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas, and has also contributed to the delivery of Beltranszgaz, which has passed through the country, wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive a travel authorisation because of the political settlement of addemocratic Belarus.
It was a preliminary relief that the OSCE focused more on positive moves in the evaluation of the election campaign, not on shortcomings, such as banning the third start of opposition candidates.
However, the rapid report of the OSCE on Monday has already objected to the campaign - during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press in essence - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present in the calculation of the votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners were released, and Minsk was willing to negotiate with Moscow on a minor basis, and continues to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia - which forms a federal state on paper - has been considered independent of two areas a month ago.
- We have taken two steps forward, one step behind, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said Aleksandr Millinkevics to our tab.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that "the power was afraid to let in any opposition to the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest against the results, rather the message of the need for economic reforms to be sent to the voters.
Of course, we have a lot of problems, we need to print opposition cards in Russia, create obstacles to the presentation by the local authorities, but I see that more and more people are supporting change, including the elderly - said Mirlinkevics, referring to Lukashenko's regime, which considers the main result of creating social security, not even the layer of officially supported pensioners.
Because of the country's indebtedness, the increase in trade deficit, it's a matter of time before the social security of the "muggler" - said Millinkevics.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the United States of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novostyi: "no words, but people believe in actions", so the lack of opposition is a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Reggel only before working hours"
In the history of Chigi Palace, doorways were uniquely set up for the exit and entry of workers.
From today on, this new measure will come into effect against the operators, to filter those who block, and then go get a coffee at work.
The anti-cloping novelty was introduced today to the Secretary-General of the State of Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, the Prime Minister's Office.
"The coil gate," said Brunetta - for better and more efficient work, for reducing gaps and increasing services."
"There will be a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is the real reform," emphasised Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete the equipment of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says it's also symbolicly important to install the screws.
We have not experienced any resistance from the employees - the Secretary-General has confirmed: "The workers have approved the measure, everyone has cooperated."
So the breakfast's over at work, no more coffee and no brios.
Brunetta smiles: "a nice capuccino can do wonders at seven o'clock in the morning"
In the Roman Public Administration College
At the meeting, the Minister announced: "In three months, the public sector's deficiencies in the cause of disease have been reduced by 50 per cent, which in one year means six hundred thousand people have more jobs".
At the same time, he added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
" whose wage dynamics, according to the Minister, were twice as high as the private sector in the last eight to ten years and well exceeded the rate of inflation."
At the same time, thousands of public officials gathered, joining the submission supported by the Italian Organisation for Environment and Consumer Protection, to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Administration is proud of the data used to support the reduction of disease deficiencies, the "unsatisfiable suns" war is constantly increasing," says the Consumer Protection Association.
All over Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff gathered together to send out a war of illegal regulations."
The Regional Administrative Court shall, inter alia, challenge the abolition of supplementary nutrition funds for diseases that can be returned to service, the extension of the stay of workers on sick leave at home, a period within which the patient may appear and a number of other aspects included in the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Occupational accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
In Italy, there are 2.500 accidents at work each day, of which 3 deaths and 27 sustained disability occur.
According to the occupational accident insurance data, nearly 1.200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and requires almost twice as many victims as manslaughter.
Today, Anmil will organise the day of the victims of accidents at work in all countys of Italy, the traditional second Sunday of October, to draw attention to this dramatic problem of institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the recent days, confirm that in the event of accidents at work, prevention is of outstanding importance", said Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic of Pietro Mercandelli, in his message to the President of the National Association of Baleseti Rokkantak.
The Head of State has sincerely praised the 'responsive commitment of the community to preventing at work, protecting the interests of the workers affected by the accident, helping the family of victims and putting public opinion into captivity'.
"It is natural and truly shared by everyone that this kind of confusion is created, by their size, by the tragedy of media and public interest, but in reality we must face day-to-day dramatic, repeated and repeated cases."
Napolitano openly confesses: "We are fighting without resources, funding education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at direct education for young people who enter the world of work are of particular importance.
We have a duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be paid to the social importance of the issue, and to improve legislation that needs to be applied.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the lower house, stressed that "the serious social importance of the accidents at work, all of us, is required of the institutions to put an end to it as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still incredibly high", noted Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We don't want this decreasing trend to mate, with a reduction of attention, because the worst tragedy in the fall of attention is happening."
"We believe that, at general level, we still do not do everything we can to overcome the phenomenon, which could be resolved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, it would be necessary to monitor and monitor more closely - he stressed Mercandelli - as well as a more robust intervention in the field of labour training, from school education."
He added that "more efforts are needed to inform and make public aware of public opinion".
What is most necessary, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that is a social problem".
Mr Mercandelli then criticised "the gradual deterioration of the network of compensation for victims of accidents at work" and the "aid direction towards which the system is drifting in recent years".
"So the goal is to return the insurance provided to the workers, because the fate of the victims of the accident must not depend on the self-evident and where the measures taken by the legislators."
Can cause hearing damage to MP3 players
The remaining hearing damage may result in longer and high sound levels of portable players such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the scientific committee for new and newly identified health risks (SCENIHR), informed the European Commission, referring to the opinion published today.
"The opinion shows that people who for five years for more than an hour a day listen to hearing losses of 5-10 per cent, with high volume, can be read in the explanation.
"It is worrying that young people who use portable music players and mobile phones operating in large numbers and in practice are not aware of the fact that they can irreversibly damage their hearing", says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk, which we urgently need to respond to", the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate them widely.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing systems of control so that they can function effectively and keep pace with the latest technologies".
Brussels invited the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people who are exposed to noise.
"The researchers confirm that there is cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people who are exposed to the noise caused by portable players and similar instruments", said the Committee member.
The current European safety standards set out maximum noise levels for portable music players in 100 dB, although there is growing concern about the damage to hearing resulting from excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing defects.
The Scientific Committee of the EU explains in its opinion that users who listen to music (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week are using portable player, the sound level exceeds the current maximum level for workplace noise.
If someone listens to music for a longer period of time in similar circumstances, there will be a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of users of portable devices, which could mean 2.5 to 10 million in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today begins, until March, the results are expected in June.
This timetable was set up by the Capital Authority for the operation of the Committee called "The Future of the capital of Rome", which was held this morning at the new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 Commission members will draw up Rome's guidelines.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the general meeting and the municipal committee in order to be able to submit the strategic plan officially approved by the Prime Minister of Local Government and Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a fully independent committee, in which it represents all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas, emphasised Alemanno, and stressed the task of drawing up proposals for Rome's development ideas for which political decision-makers, the General Assembly and the Government Committee can rely.
There is no conflict of competence, but we wanted only a platform where big plans for Rome could be created.
In March, after you've done your job, the committee will be disbanded because it has a fixed term mandate.
In June we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the capital of Romania - the Mayor said.
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, referring to the fact that the advice it sets out is not binding, Alemanno answers: "All depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of proposals it makes on the table.
If the quality is proven to be appropriate, as will the Attali Commission in France, which I am sure for Rome, it will play an important role in its contribution.
The strength of politics is often fragmented in the day-to-day affairs and in the handling of urgent cases that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further in the long term, and we plan for a longer period, and we are committed to working towards Rome's development and future".
The Mayor of Rome wishes to state that "this Commission cannot be regarded as useless "waterhead", as it will not be completely free of charge to any of the Roman citizens, but it will serve as an incentive to think and be involved in the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump on the quality that it needs so much, thinking about its future in a single spirit".
Regarding the future of Rome, the mayor of Rome stresses: "He will not only be limited to the current municipal framework but rather look further away", we see not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital city, but also "the role that he can play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region, and which he must fill in".
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician who is independent of himself wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first one was Jimmy Carter, who destroyed the American economy with his decisions and maintained close relationships (as he does as a private man today) with the hostile Islam."
As soon as the election comes, the attacks on Obama are becoming more frequent.
A lady in Miami wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama's faceless belief that he could gain the highest public rights of a nation whose two governors and five senators were black until now!"
These attacks are really nothing; they are racist, of course, but do not answer the voters' question of whether they will be a good president. Then here are the public opinion polls: they indicate that Obama will win with a significant advantage.
In this case, there is one who will listen to his emotions and not to his mind.
In the south of the United States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in its guide piece: we know well that in the polling aid, the real American patriot will vote for who.
There's a side of American thinking that remains hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk about what you want, and then we'll know where we'll put it, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
They never said such words until now, when the black candidate’s success was almost certain.
At the same time, despite all this cleverness, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked about the mistakes that were made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent responded to Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation has lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and has been set to the bottom of his flight home.
In Iraq, 45,000 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
But most people still think Iraq was Bush's weakness.
There's a huge task for the person who's in George W's place.
U.S.: the economic collapse has been felt by journalists, the time of restrictions in editors has come. Many people blame the Internet for the "dead" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists how they felt about their future situation and their spiritual power.
Well, at the moment, almost every journalist's nest about his own future.
However, it was not clearly stated that their concerns regarding authenticity were reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
American journalists have a problem with money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failure of a forceless economic model.
Further, there are serious problems with the newsroom, i.e. restrictions on the editors of the newspaper.
If we do not want the traditional journalism, in the sense of what the great public understands, to go down to a minimum, we need to solve this problem - say the asked journalists.
Today, there is a visible and complex pessimism characterized by American journalism.
Sixty percent of the journalists and senior leaders working in the printed press are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in upper leadership position.
It's printed against the electronic press.
Press staff don't make it difficult to see where the world net is going.
The biggest publishers break their way to the Internet, which many say is the "killer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 asked journalists admitted that he would put down a box next to technology, in the hope that it might be in the interest of journalism.
Today, in the American press, there's a gap between the editors, the directors, and the reporters that work for them.
At national level, 56% of managers are sure that their scientists share their information with others, while at local level this ratio can only be made to 23%.
Some of them put this safe place of work in the context.
At national level, 47% of managers fear that they can lose their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this rate is 30%.
In America, the question of 'safe work' is constantly on the agenda at team level (for our editors, tool.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
For a huge nation like the United States of 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers operate, employers usually recommend as much as they want, so the thing works on the basis of "kell or do not".
Directors generally receive high pay, and editors can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month, in addition to paying pensions and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, however, is a rather complicated principle: in the first year x days, in the third too, until after a certain period it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own statement, often "sick me up" during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMANIA BREAKDOM: DANIO COPPOLA GROTTAERRABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Court of the Roman Court, rejected Danilo Coppola's request in the real estate business, who wanted to travel from his place of residence to a Roman apartment from Grotttiferrata.
There is an economic bankruptcy investigation against Coppola in the context of an agreement on the exchange of shares in Unipol - BNL.
Last week, in the proceedings against him, the house arrest was removed and turned it into a housing ban on Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetono Pecorella, have requested that the real estate specialist be able to travel from the rural town to the capital city.
However, according to the Court, these gases (which the prosecutor proposed were rejected) would enable the company to influence and access the evidence it brought against them.
In danger, the elite
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the 700 billion-dollar rescue package presented by the White House: a large number of Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is supported by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis has caused a break within the Republican Party, which shows an increasing division between the traditional, restored, federal and business lines of the Eastern Coastal attitude that supports the federal institutions and business circles and the ever-growing new direction of anti- Washington and finance in the Central and South states.
This trend was expressed in a critical way in the vote in the House of Representatives referred to in the introduction.
However, the event above is only one of the major changes which even today's economic transformation can predict or present, and not only in the United States, but in the whole Western world, or perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, even in the USA and Europe, is only speeding up the very long-standing phenomena that are solid in this new atmosphere and are finally being brought to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-activeisation, the return of the double category of state sovereignty to public awareness, the re-statement of a kind of economy.
The crisis affects banking-financial institutions that are also closely connected with abroad, but mainly, and quite widely, with people and families living in a single country.
This, however, is a direct political challenge for those in the government: what to respond to the difficulties and objections of people who are also a matter of choice.
So, in economic terms, the crisis seems to be of the same global size, but in a political sense, it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internacionalism is essentially out of the coast: the European Union's clear evidence of this is not able to define a uniform policy line, which is drawn between different interests and national strategies.
So everyone expects intervention from individual national governments, the rescue package, the resurgence and the new rules, but above all, the opening of the funds: since only individual states have economic resources in an emergency, a financial set that can make things right.
They have the means and the authorisation to use them: in certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that are likely to never have any other market or international organisation to such an extent.
In addition, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nation state is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times is increasingly a factor that is closely linked to this body: it is territorial.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the world of network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was ordered to rule the world, once we had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were less and less abstract than water, crop and oil.
Things that can be moved from one half of the planet to another, yet entirely linked to a certain location, can be linked to an area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more punch cards than someone who was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I would also turn to the second novelty that suggests a kind of breakline.
Anyone who says territory, state, government, is also saying, "policy," in other words, driving.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two congested phenomena:
On the one hand, an objective recognition of the need for credible leadership is required for those who can handle events.
On the other hand, current leadership, in particular economic leaders, is making a total loss of credit, who have proved to be totally inappropriate and proven that many areas of darkness are still ahead of them.
Together, the two have even deeper importance and in a certain way are more worrying: the feeling of loss of credit, patience, incompetence and isolation, which affects the entire elite of leaders in an increasing number of Western countries.
So it seems that the growing population is becoming convinced that the time of social elite at the top of the world has passed. Before they did their actions, their experiences, their lifestyles, their culture, their culture, the complex of the word, they would have made themselves. This would make social elite increasingly evasive from the opinion of the majority.
This was not expected by the voters in their "representation" or in the recent sudden changes to the public voice. For example, the entry of conservatives into power in Austria and Bajora, the collapse of the Labour Party unit in Great Britain, or the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right-hand side may be included).
It seems that the traditional elite, parties, programs, and even those of the Western society can say that in college, with its customs, press, and ridiculous intelligence, you can understand less and less and less, and that you can represent what is going on in the deeper layers of Western society for some time. Furthermore, the economic crisis is becoming stronger, spread and potentially able to create increasingly insoluble emotions.
Despite all this, "the imminent rebellion of the masses" would be an outrage to speak frankly.
But it's no use walking around with an open eye.
We can go with super-strong glue on the wall.
Using a super-strong glue, beat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions is nearing the solution.
With only a 2.5 square centimetre glue piece, researchers managed to attach a 100 kilos body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal TANULMÁNY - A Science published the discovery of some of the researchers of Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the scientific group has already been developed from the further development of existing specific substances, i.e. carbon nano-circuit structures.
"The principle of action of glue must be imagined as a set of pipe systems similar to spaghetti," says zhong Lin Wang, researcher at the Atlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
The researchers drew the idea from the foot of the gecko microscopic ladder, which provides perfect touch to the animal.
The tests with different materials, such as glass, teflon and teflon, supported that the new adhesive was ten times more effective than those of these reptiles, while "the wall is lightly removed" explains the researcher of the engineering arm of Liming Dai, of the University of Dayton.
- "This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive" - adds Liming Dai.
We can walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Perhaps, but researchers are more concerned with a less impressive use than the interconnection of electronic devices, because carbon nanopipes are a good driver of heat and electrical power.
You can find more applications in space research.
Superheroes can wait.
THE OTHER COURSE - University of Berkeley, California, is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive.
According to the article published in American Chemical Society c., Californian scientists presented a hair-like microfibrous fabric that goes through self-cleaning during the movement on the surface, so it always provides perfect grips.
No medicine, no fruit.
You need to watch out for Grapefruit, orange and alkaloids.
These high-vitamin drinks, which are mainly popular in summer, if taken together with certain life-saving medicines, change their absorption, reinforced or reduced, depending on the case, and may have serious health consequences.
At the 236 national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, the professor of London University of Ontario announced that a glass of Grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering patient health.
Grapefruit juice has already gone to the defendant's bench before it turned out to be able to increase the effect of some antibiotics, antihistamine, anxiety-responsive, heart rhythm control and nerve medication to a toxic level.
KOCKÁZÁS EDUCATION - Two years ago, the Italian Pharmaceutical Institute itself published the news in the official press, and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks of such co-administration and to watch what they drink when they take medicines such as Diizepam or Metadon.
NO CREAK GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A list of active substances that interfere with the absorption of Grapefruit and other fruit juices could be included.
To this end, Michele Carruba, professor of the medical department of the University of Milan: "In general, such discoveries are reported immediately to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutions, who, if necessary, will ensure that the information contained in this medicinal product is changed.
That is why you should always read the leaflet for the medicinal product you intend to take, and if something is not understandable, let us not be influenced, but let us clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist" - stressed the expert at the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Economic Prize
The U.S. Paul Krugman received the Nobel Economic Prize for the analysis of territorial relations between commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neokeynesian Krugman, teaches at Princeton University, and is a well-known publicist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the weakest critics of the Bush government's economic and foreign policy measures.
After the September 2001 terrorist attack, a few months when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman, in his lead story published in the New York Times, predicted that the latter event would have more disastrous consequences for the history of the United States than for the collapse of twin towers.
This forecast was not a few debates, but it has been pointed out several times to the public, but today we know that it was accurate.
"I am surprised, and I am also a little shocked to see how quickly public interest has gone through the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom", Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "perfect economist", but at the same time spreads his criticisms against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government in a rather aggressive way."
Open Office, third edition was also worth the "Crosoft Anti-Mrosoft" package.
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is released today, an open program-code application package that increases personal productivity, which aims at increasing levels as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from freelancers to administrations.
After almost a year of work carried out by SUN Microsystem and voluntary developers, the new Open Office enters the public with a number of novelties: on a welcome screen and a re-thinked, less spartate user interface, it offers more important novelties. For example, the compatibility with Apple Mac OS X operational system and supports the new ISO-standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to the compatibility with Office 2007 so Open Office can open new extension Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting even some modules have specific features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful if you send a file via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphical module by retaining the site layout.
We can also create "hybrid PDF" documents on this same interface, which combines typical Adobe format with the desktop management or text editor elements.
The distribution of applications has also gone through a number of improvements: the table manager supports the common use of workbooks, but it prevents over-working. Each employee's contribution is marked with different colors, which will help you to identify more easily at the inspection phase.
Some companies already work to make some of the features of OpenOffice available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version will probably be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after you have been on the terrorist sites since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openOffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can either take the installation CD at our home or at our workplace on request.
With regard to the spread of home application, freeness is probably the biggest attraction, but the Open Office programme package is now trying to kick the business sector into the ball, as it can count on many administrative and school projects.
Neither are small and medium-sized enterprises ideal education, advisory and service services, which can open up new business horizons.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, the Word editor; Calc, a table manager to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is like the most well-known, Access database manager; and, finally, Draw is the graphic module.
The 2008 target is to reach 5 million downloads. However, if you take into account that the new version has been released for over 3.600.000, this figure will probably be higher than the expected number.
The result is positive, it's the fourth Dopping case.
At the most recent stage of Tour de France, one of the participants once again produced a positive sample, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, competing in the Gerolsteiner team, who also won the best tip for the bronzérem.
The news is on the Equipe website.
The 26-year-old Koll is the fourth contestant after the Italian Riccardo Riccę and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German, Gerolsteiner contestant Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the third generation of the EPO test.
As in recent weeks, Kohl blood samples have been studied in labs in Lausanne and Chatenay-malabry.
If the checks confirm the positive Cera results, Austria loses its third position and, according to the rules, prohibits competition for two years.
Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, confirmed the positive outcome of the third generation EPO test in Kohl, and the Associated Press announced the positive result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians managed to set up a podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and won the best mountain-leading trick.
RECOGNISING: IS THE NEW YORK PROPOSALS ON THE CERTAIN, ORASIA?
Italy's migrant country has only recently become one of the popular targets of the migratory migrants who have been admitted to it.
This is the question of the New York Times, which, based on the case of Abdul William Guibre, young Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan because he stole a box of biscuits - a long article devoted to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well marked by what the New York Times calls "the paradox of the scientists": in the northern regions "the strongest is integration and the highest employment", however, "the anti-tourism and the support of the North League" is also the strongest in the country.
The NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno to support increasing tension between immigrants.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would bring the lawn closer to immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, were introduced as an example of changing the mood in Italy.
This trend was highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. Benedi met in Quirinale Palace and raised the argument that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students can pay up to 900 euros for expensive rentals.
The market for accommodation issued to universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the Locator Trade Association, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already reached an amazing extent, which, in view of the total cost for families, closes the wide ranges of students from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office of Sunia. "In these cities, high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general reduction process has been launched against local people."
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts, non-registered contracts, linked sub-loans.
According to Sunia, there is a need for an exceptional measure that allows prices to be maximised by reviewing the tax system.
The details of the survey show that there are 450 euros per bed in Milan, around Brianza; the price of a single room is from 650 euros (Bande Nere neighbourhood) to 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) on average, but it can reach 900 euros (Vitoria neighbourhood).
In Florence, a bed space costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room of about 700.
In Bologna, where students live in a large area close to the university, a bed space costs 250/280 euros when it comes to doubles and 370-500 euros when it comes to single rooms.
In Rome, San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna, about 600 euros for a single person and 450 for a bed in a two-person room.
Something cheaper (550 euros in a single room) is prices around other universities (Ostientse and Cinecità).
In the suburbs, you can save all: 300 euros a bed and 450 single rooms in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they're asking for 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for one room. The highest parking place is around Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bari has to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are at an absolute lower value, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, another disorder can be seen: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good old Cinema Paradiso, the old cinema halls have been sacrificed in the cities
Traditional movies close for the Multiplexes.
"A city where there are no movies, a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The images taken by the director Giuseppe Tornatore provide an effective presentation of everything that goes on in Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The reduction of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-tier cinemas in the suburbs and, as a result, the persuasion of one-tiers in the city centres - is an inevitable and reversible process, but at the same time it carries all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend goes away, a friend with whom we shared our street and many experiences", says Cinema Paradiso director. The film, which reported to Tornatore, the grand prize of the Cannes festival, the Irish story of a small-town cinema, after a death row, after a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data provided by Anec, is clearly spoken: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed. The biggest losses were recorded in cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is one of the most affected regions, which has lost 82 single-tier movies, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that for their disappearance, the volume of multiplexes is not better proven by us than Italy's highest number of newly opened multi-tier movies in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of rooms increased by 195 in Lombardia, with 81 in Tuscany and the same amount in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy increased irrationally," says the President of Anec Paolo Protti. "It is high that we are building new facilities, but we also need to ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when a city cinema is closed, not all walkers are willing to go through multiple problems.
Not to mention unsolicited financial funds intended to support operators: the State's debt can be committed to approximately EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is disgraceful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
It would require 16-18 million euros per year to maintain the market".
This is the first Italian city that has decided to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and boost one-sided movies in foreign and downtown.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators, as well as benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers may enter restricted zones and parking in certain parking areas with preferential tariffs.
'I like this initiative' - says Giuseppe Tornatore - 'and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna, even with other measures.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas will be able to fight the rule of multiplexes, that they will have to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of the traditional cinema was always an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the heart rate which, after all, made me do Cinema Paradiso, although I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to via Nazionale in front of the locked Rialto or Quirinale, so I don't see the blackboards covered by powder, I'd rather turn my head around.
He was arrested for the mayor of Gioia Tauro, a close link between politics and 'ndrangheta'.
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromodel clan in municipal decisions."
Serious accusations were made against the Mayor and Vice-President of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrio and Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning in criminal proceedings.
Blincs was also taken into the hands of a senior intermediary between Gioacchino Piromodel, the clan and the Administration, and a lawyer named the boss, who had previously been convicted of being involved in a mob crime, and was sued for EUR 10 million.
"The absence of all legal and moral rules, what is more, good taste", is written by state attorneys.
"So the clan would have been officially introduced to the city hall, which would have provided additional opportunities for the control and control of the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the Assembly of the Calabrian Region, does not hide that the region has "a number of matches between the local institutions and the organized sub-world": There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere where the collusive is likely to be inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of the 'ndrangtheta, they are heroes who remain clean'.
This morning's arrests continue to take place in July, when the police announced that they had managed to eliminate the Pyromodel clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were released from their mandate for the administration of the municipality. In 1991, Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved, even because of the suspected conflicts between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Christian Democratic Mayor of the Age of Distribution, took the lead in the second round of 2006 of the right-wing coalition.
Botrány cried out when County ordered the disunity of the municipal committee.
The former Minister of Home Affairs referred Marco Minnini to the Court and accused him of planning everything with a political purpose. However, the court stated in the arrest warrant signed this morning that until then, the Pyromodel clan had failed to demand that the A3 project be changed.
The hearing he ordered against Dal Torrion is revealed by the state attorneys - that "it was necessary to comply with the demands of an entrepreneur representing a large group known to the Piromus family, to submit the decisions of the municipality to the clan's interest."
The energy comes from the waves, and the big ones are coming.
An unsatisfiable energy source that accounts for 70 percent of the planet's surface, and which is still being discovered by big international energy companies
Hullams, sea currents, floods, renewable energy sources, such as Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on it.
They've been searching for the possibility of gaining energy from the sea's movements for hundreds of years.
Around 1980, when the price of oil fell, the idea of using marine energy has been put aside, but today the need for environmental protection and the renewed rise in oil prices give the sector a new impetus.
According to the 2007 London World Energy Council (WEC) estimates that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea wave recovery facilities.
This quantity is twice what is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and the floods would still be there.
The giants are flying.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a plant to be set up in Northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
It has been two years since then, and more and more companies have made a drop in sea energy, including those who have so far been committed to traditional energy.
"Chevron study ocean energy technologies and consider the possibility of co-operation with us," said the speaker of one of the associated companies in the American oil industry, Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of the authorisation for the launch of a sub-project for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the US Energy Committee.
It is not a small matter, especially if we consider that the US is carrying out oil extraction in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
Besides Chevron, the New York Verdant Power Inc. and the New Jersey Ocean Power are on the way to energy from the sea.
Technology is about to be developed.
According to the experts, this is still an initial technology, not only because the energy obtained from the sea does not dispel environmental concerns.
Currently existing facilities similar to Portugal or Scotland are both small and therefore no major problems arise in the ecosystem.
However, in order to generate energy in a larger scale, installations that have a greater environmental impact are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power uses, for example, a connected billiard system.
The thrustes created by the waves and moving up and down the bows are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure is turning a turbine, which feeds a generator.
The electrical power reaches the land by cables drawn below the sea.
At the same time, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are just waiting for federal permission, and some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, however, has already started energy production for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six sub-sea turbines located in the East River, New York.
At the time of the flood, the movement of the water turns the skins of the turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that he had a long list of partners waiting only for the necessary permits to use energy.
It's flooding after drugs.
At present, there is a need for a distinction between opportunities that can be exploited through price caps.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the price gap is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, so it can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent 7.5 million dollars in 2008, just using the energy provided by the price range, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
