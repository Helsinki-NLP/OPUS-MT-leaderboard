The victory of right-wing populists in Austria, 29 percent in total
According to the first preliminary results, the marked weakening of the two parties of the previous major coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties were the Sunday parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the other hand, President of the Alliance for Austria's Future (BZÖ), head of Karintia Province, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
Based on the preliminary results, the country's strongest party will remain 29.8% of the votes, but it has lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
The OVP has even worse, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results achieved so far in the post-war history of both big parties and, in particular, the disastrous outcome of the People's Party that has given rise to the elections.
At the beginning of July, at the departure of the OVP coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage before the SPÖ according to public opinion polls.
However, the voters evidently punished him for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been expressed about the possible resignation of Wilhelm Molterer and of the current alkalinary.
The observers believe that this may take place on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party.
This development would probably make it easier for the result of the election to be a more likely way out, i.e. the revitalisation of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populists - 18% of the votes in advance by the Austrian Party for Freedom (FPÖ) and 11% by BZÖ - however, the Socialists expressed their fear of repeated the year 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united, which became a member of the BZÖ in 2005), which even made sanctions on the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna for national policy, is obviously the solution.
The Greens Party came to Parliament, which, however, fell from a somewhat lost popularity, and between the Austrian political parties fell from the third place to the fifth.
None of the other parties exceeded the four-percent limit and did not get to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Interreg with India
If we did not manage to solve the problem of Czech scientists reporting for illegal bug collection, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be some coldness in the Czech-India relations.
This was published by the Minister in New York after his meeting with Pranab Mukherji, Indian partner today.
"If this had not been resolved, yes, there would be some coldness," he stated after the meeting, which was made of Czech incentive.
After the trial, Mukherji said that in court, executive power could be hard to intervene.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who has been released and punished, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the case belongs.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
However, according to Mukherji, it would be best for Emil Kučera to appeal to the Supreme Court for three years.
Then you could apply for parole against bail and wait for the sentence freely, you explained.
Schwarzenberg proved that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, so it would be possible to rescue him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is by providing the sentenced with "competent legal support", mentioned the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side already provides them with such help.
"Our primary interest in India is to maintain the best relations with India many years ago.
This is acknowledged by Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČKT, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We find it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The question whether the Indian party has received a promise to deal with the matter is whether the Minister has excluded the answer.
"I've received relatively many promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
Steps up to the wall electronic map, on which Australia and neighbouring maritime areas are visible.
But you don't care about the continent, but you're an outstanding point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, along with it is the neighboring seabed.
In the course of the area, he is the continent itself," says Luigi Santosuoso, Italian lawyer, who is part of 30 members of the UN Division Ocean and Maritime Law Working Group.
His boss, the Czech lawyer Vaclav Mikulka, director of the division, will monitor the explanation that is sometimes supplemented.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm here.
The bottom of the sea is rich in natural resources, barely known to the world.
It is possible here that oil, nickel and other minerals are found, but also existing living organisms are also unknown, which, for example, can be the key to developing a cancer medicine.
Seabeds greater than dry land
The coastal states are today in an intensive way looking for new sub-maritime areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, their rights are being enforced, which was agreed in 1982 at the Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is primarily about the area of the so-called continental foundation, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coasts of that country.
Such a country has exclusive rights under the Convention to all sources of the Continental Charter.
"Simplified, we hold the part of the continental foundation of the seabed and the lower layer, which is the natural continuation of the underground part of the sea.
On the shores of the sea, often two hundred miles [200 km] above the border of the exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission designating the external borders of the Continental Charter should be supplemented by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many annual preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Committee has so far negotiated five applications for Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three countries mentioned have succeeded," added Mikulka.
In the world, the success of Australia has recently been a success, first of all, a major expansion of its sub-maritime country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of seabeds awarded to the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometres, that is, six times larger in the territory of the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed will hopefully be invaluable.
Other countries continue to submit their applications.
This can be done within ten years of the moment of the ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental foundation ends, the Convention begins with the area of oceanbeds declared by the "common heritage of humanity".
There's no one country here that's got a situation here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says overed Director Mikulka, saying, "some areas are legally clearly defined and their regime laid down in contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern Block is divided into other countries within the framework of the Joint "Interocean" organization.
In 1991, as with investors in some other countries, this organisation received the status of so-called ‘invasion investor’ under the Convention.
It is entitled to produce in the Pacific Ocean in the zone of ClarionClipton between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area examined by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
It's a copy of Tatra under the sea.
"A total of 75 000 square kilometres can be produced in this area.
The area is a rich deposits of nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the Division Macedonian, presents another example of concrécy.
With a potato or some fantasy, it reminds me of the parchment with the magic words of Golemet's life.
German special forces in hostage release
The Egyptian government requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became a commotion, the special units were ready, but they did not receive their deployment.
The release of eleven European tourists who have been kidnapped in Egypt is becoming more and more detail.
German special forces were involved in the rescue action, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
According to this, in addition to the experts of the Federal Army of Germany, GSG 9, the flight of the Federal Police of Germany, and the staff of the Federal Crime Agency, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were on the scene of the release.
According to the information provided by the ministers of the Ministry on Monday evening, however, German forces did not need to be allowed to run their prisoners and then fled when they recognized signs of violent hostage.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a ground support force.
"We're lucky it didn't happen" said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers were abducted from five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman, and eight of their Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on September 19th.
After the kidnapping in the desert of South Egypt, the hostages were dragged here in the border area of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until now, as well as details of the release of hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the refugees arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier told me that the liberated hostages were protected by the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin, they did not yet provide any information as to when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and the special forces arrive on the Airbus aircraft of the German Air Force on Tuesday.
The U.S. Assembly rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress's lower house has failed the 700 billion-dollar rescue package proposed for the money markets with a small majority.
The Dow Jones fell deep.
The U.S. Assembly rejected the government's rescue package for the money markets by 227 votes against.
Despite the calls of President Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, George W. Bush did not receive a majority of the program to contain the chaos on the money markets.
The supporters were desperate to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called on representatives to support it, even if the plan was even unpopular.
"You've got to get political support to avoid something that hasn't even come in."
Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote and then fell again after the failure to publish.
Experts report further serious turbulence on the international money markets.
It is necessary to approve both the Assembly and the Senate in order to bring this programme into force.
The directors are registering more and more reservations.
It's a good winter promise for German tour operators.
According to a study, road reservations for the following months have increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season by more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the Germans’ travel advantage was not reduced according to the study.
For the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded 31 per cent traffic growth compared to the previous year, announced the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of autumn months' reservations is higher.
The turnover of the travel agencies was rounded by 11 per cent from October 2007, reported DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agents and then extrapolates them to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the travels booked by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate of travel to the U.S. in particular, DRV reported.
Here the volume of reservations has risen by a third.
The Germans are particularly fond of their journeys in addition to Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as their domestic landscapes.
They were looking for the most organized roads - said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Because of the rising energy and food costs, the costs for organised roads can be "a lot more calculated for passengers than for journeys organised individually."
Among other things, passengers can save money by booking discounts or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to re-book traffic growth from the previous year - although another study shows that fewer German tourists undertake their journey compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Without a stop, repeated Ballermann hits, literical rites and famous dirndlits.
Debutation of Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are actually not much alike.
She's a blonde, television programmer, and she's wearing a customized dirnd.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the shaker.
But one thing connects us: We're barely three minutes away from Wiesnen, we've already been attacked by photographers and filled with memory cards - very flattered, and all this at my first visit to Wiesnen.
So we can make friends.
Looks like the cheap dindli's gonna do the job.
As a national tourist from the white sausage to the north of Wiesn, my comfort field has yet to be limited.
But when Theresienwies arrived, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears couches or leather pants; no one looks up or embarrassed - everything's all right.
Strange sightings at the chocolate stand just for my dindl bandage.
A woman in Munich calls my attention that I made a bad tie, "You're free, you're in the middle of a virgin, you're on the right, you're widowed in the back."
I secretly tied the masnit from behind to left.
"That's good," he says, and he laughs.
Others are making less money around fine flirting techniques, and they're just wearing "I'm too drunk to dress up" and without asking for their naked butt.
The young man showing exhibionistic traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest in the first time.
What you find very fantastic is long-ranged "aaaaaaaa".
He's telling me all this after getting rid of the contents of his presiding corpus.
Right next to one of the fire traps everyone thinks is garbage.
So, Bob's one of the famous 'squeakers'.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the ambulances are going through the scene and taking care of the poor couples.
Patient nurses always appear on the team - four of them carry a covered barrel at the same time from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival is empty, departure is duplicated.
The fact that she's lying in the liquor cake underneath her ponyva doesn't seem to be.
"These are the ones who are completely ready" he said to me, one of the Sanicts asked my question, and then in the Forgatag.
The police named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who hit a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, happened on Friday afternoon.
She was transported to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romaford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released against bail ever since.
Turkish diplomatic horizon
Before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers burned the desire to penetrate the Turkish background deeply.
On the east side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of failed empire ambition.
The Hydropasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what travel books write.
The building surrounded the end of the perons, with one or two towers at each front corner, and it looks like some German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little dwindling.
However, it is clear from the inside of the shopping notebook that this large enterprise had the westernest gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the late future of the conquests, through this railway leading to today's Saudi Arabia from Damascus to Baghdad, wanted to achieve its ambitions to capture the Middle East.
Germany's efforts to conquer went down during World War I.
The railway lines were attacked by the parties of Lawrence and Arabic in Arabia.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British Georgian army withdrew from Egypt and squeezed out the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station didn't go any better.
In 1917, a ammunition transport train exploded and destroyed the well-made roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, sabotage has occurred.
Since then, it's been getting a little worse, and history's gone a long way.
At the same time today, as the gate of the Anastrian and the entire eastern region - at least symbolicly - it serves as a diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The government Party for Justice and Development - the ACP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, Iraq, Iran, and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded up the night train to the capital city of Turkey, Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts in the ACP, the Turkish parliament representative, Suat Kiniklu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours, I arrived in the Turkish capital, a famous documentary about the old world, the "The Night Mail" rhythm. The new city is designed for the symbol of the new world state, which turned its back on the past.
However, the ACP, known as Islamic roots, represents a paradigma change in Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
I went with Taxi to the AKP Cathedral, an ultra-modern, stone and steel building, specifically designed for this purpose, which is located in a developing district, between semi-prepared shopping malls and coffee houses, and in the latter case, the suits meet the middle-leaders - both men and women - to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kinikoliglu would have included a better-orientated politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to assist Turkey's reintegration into its immediate environment.
The Cold War covered the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from the country of back.
He had to turn east and west at the same time today.
He couldn't have chosen one of the two.
He had to open both directions.
"But it's possible he's going to make a choice sooner or later?" I asked him.
Turkey never wanted to get ahead of it.
He then stressed what almost everyone I was talking to here, almost automatically again: Turkey's relations with the Middle East, not only with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea, will benefit Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
It is as if the message was to be sent to Asia and the Middle East, together with Turkey, on those railways to the east.
When I was back at the Hydropasha station, after a new, largely awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the reconstruction of this fine building 100 years ago.
That they would have wondered if they found out that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I expected the ferry in the port to take me back to Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was then called "a sick man of Europe".
At least at that time there was no question of which continent needs this exciting country.
Lifespan: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as director of Guildford's music, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, Sept. 11) has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Hospital.
Based on the musical plans for the part of the city, Proteus created his wonderful youth choir next year.
In principle, only under 21 years of age could have been the singing box, but when Proteus was singing his account in 1979, many of us were already in our 20s - we simply refused to remove the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer's name) was in line with the determination and ability of the choir to deal with any bag they put before - be the Madrid or a Messiaen piece; without escort or with the help of the great orchestra.
The diversity of music in such a young choir was often amazing and always exciting, and we were able to thank the man whose inspiration for the music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it."
The conductor's technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but it's never dictatorial or excessive.
As much as the quality of music was, he always did.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If you've ever lived a conductor who was supposed to be a knight, that was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted with the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
I've written criticism about more than 100 concerts in the last forty years, but never, never, ever, have disappointed them and often confronted them.
In Tod Handley, there was both greatness and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated those conductors who, living with his words, simply "with one or two well-known chastals, were galloping all over the world."
Many of us will miss you.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
According to your William Woodruff (September 25), "in 1946 he continued his economic history studies in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Institute of Research... while constantly preparing for his basic diploma, master's diploma and PhD title."
It comes from the authors of Woodruff's work called Beyond Nab End, but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he completed his PhD discussion of the British rubber industry under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers at Nottingham University, which was then released in 1958 under the title "The British rubber industry".
Indeed, in 1950-51, he was in the USA with a Houblon-Norma scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
I don't know why Woodruff made his career better.
J. Vicente Resino on the Warp
I recommend the exhibition "J. Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because they are black and white, documentary-style photographers.
The simplicity, strength and respect of the people in the photographs were a source of attention.
This exhibition is passed by emotions.
Resino's got it to celebrate the magic moments."
Second sale record at Honda
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation jazz.
True, his predecessor has been quite high, but the development of the new model in the internal sphere is even more extensive.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics, making driving more comfortable and increasing fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolvation.
That's how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although the new jazz is very similar to the predecessor, many internal changes were made.
For example, these include innovative design, new carosseria, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we switch to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz has been released six years after the first generation was thrown into the market.
So, first of all, we can say that in a shorter time Honda managed to renew this model than other producers.
The same Jazz is less known in Europe, but it is making sales records on other markets.
Such a market, for example, Japan, where Jazz was the most visited car brand in 2002 and then this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since the market took place.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million examples sold over six years.
However, Honda would like to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
While in 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazzs, with estimates of 100,000 cars in 2009, which would lead to an increase of 17% in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz on the Spanish market, which accounts for 6.7% of Honda's total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary calculate with an example sold during a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda’s traffic in Spain.
The company's representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4000 less than the 2007 data, i.e. a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% last year compared to 1.6%.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
According to Honda's hope, this can be achieved through the introduction of a new model.
This would be Insight, a five door and compact - 4370 mm long - hybrid, from which the Japanese company would sell 20,000 pieces a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of the Insight market distribution would be carried out by the United States, while the remaining proportion would be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The introduction of Insight's commercialisation after the official presentation of valence scheduled for January is due in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in all respects.
The length reaches 3900 mm (five centimetres longer), 1690 mm wide (two cents wider) and five centimetres of axle length, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has become more spacious.
The greater internal space is guaranteed by the new carosseria and, on the other hand, the central fuel tank - we can already know this solution from the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, the double - floored - trunk full load, which is now 399 litres, is 19 litres higher than the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes that these sizes apply to the type with engines of 1.4, since the trunk of Honda Jazz 1,2 is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be found, such as rear-floor lamps or optional panorama glass roofs, as well as rear seats with easier access.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the first Jazz 67 degrees arrow angle.
The engines of the second generation Jazz are new.
At the beginning of its rotation, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
As a result of i-VTEC technology, both resources consumption are more favourable than previous models, with lower carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine provides high engine power in all respects.
The 1,2-litre resource power is 90 horsepower at 6000 speed and maximum torque on 114 Nm 4900.
This engine - which was 78 horses in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
Jazz is 100 strong, on average, consumes 5.4 litres, and its emissions are 128 grams CO2.
The impacting "mufacturer"
For the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan, this time from nature, is exactly the inspiration for a new invention drawn from the world of bees.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that will prevent accidents from being imitated by flying bees.
The Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C will be the first step to develop impact prevention technologies.
Engineers of Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center in collaboration with the scientific and technological research centre of the renowned University of Tokyo, built this little robot in Japan.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, Director-General for Technology PR and Research, BR23C is a further extension of Nissan's four-tier safety shield.
The robot will make the company's products more complete with its ability to crash.
During flight each bee will create its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
However, it is much more important to have a complex eye of the bee, which is seen in more than 300 degrees in every direction.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers have designed a so-called laser diameter (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument detects obstacles in the 180° field of vision prior to BR23C within a distance of up to 2 m, calculate their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into an action to avoid impact.
"As a result of the perception of the obstacle, a small robot changes the motion of the uterus immediately by moving the wheels to a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is mostly distinguished from the currently available instruments, so that in this case the avoidative maneuver is completely automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" – explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of Mobility Laboratory and project chief engineer.
In a way other than bees, the avoiding manoeuvring shall not aim upwards or downwards, and shall not pass through, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels, i.e. in an infinite direction and in the manner that happens in the case of the bees.
That's why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot in addition to acceleration and deceleration to avoid collisions.
"This structure only needs to process data every few seconds and respond to them.
There is no need to store data, nor to operate with a few dozen KB memorys without interruption.
It may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but we don't even talk about memory of the size of aabyte.
This is the first step to develop an immediate impact prevention technology that, according to Nissan's estimates, can involve serial cars within ten years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries, which are easier and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In future, additional applications may be used to bring the unit into line with the GPS satellite navigation system to the end, avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury's Department, in addition to having a lot of investmentable cash, has no common sense.
Because of the crisis on their necks and the fact that the Americans did not question the drivers of paid-up mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's the hotel of bad loans... which means the pigeons.
The accommodation and especially the representation of the reception búskomor suggest, think again, twice, and, more than three times, is the time for taking credit.
And especially where to apply for credit, because it's probably the purpose of this thing.
Information on the website is really useful, but little detail.
It's more of a mess than an audience.
But what would happen if we complete the game?
For example, our room of dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, that's something, because we don't even dare dream about buying a home...
Morgan Stanley opens up capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that he provided equity to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank pays $9 billion for 21% of the capital of the company after the Morgan Stanley stock exchange went down on the stock market.
One week after the publication of the preliminary agreement, the two banks reported that MUFG purchased 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock shares at a unit price of 25,25 dollars, i.e. a total of 3 billion dollars.
The agreed price will remain above 19% of the value of the securities in the August 31st book.
The MUFG will invest another 6 billion dollars in the purchase of transferable securities, which will provide a 10% return and their exchange rate will be 31,25 dollars.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average price of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's share price was reduced by 17 hours at around 6.79% on average, and it ended up at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate the transformation into a banking holding company," explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its activities, while being controlled by Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the corporates on Wall Street.
According to the terms announced on Monday, it can be seen that the agreement has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan announced only 20% of his shares were sold to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"One week ago, we thought that the share would be entirely stocked", explains Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"But because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect potential risks."
According to the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on one share decreases by about 20%.
On the basis of the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its priority shares into shares if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley will ensure that funds from MUFG can make use of its investment potential, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not wish to provide accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the entry of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its solvency rate by around 15% according to Tier I, which will be one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said that his balance had improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, there has been a great struggle for the group, as the exchange rate of its shares has fallen to half, while the cost of non-payment risk insurance has escaped into the sky.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
Of the large investor banks, there was another "overliving" after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is the Goldman Sachs, announced last week that it cost 15 billion dollars: part of it comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa Monday declaration, Quito
The reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism of the 21st century.
This joint plan is for Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Correa in Ecuador.
On Sunday, following the pattern of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa developed his ideas about the new constitution.
His mission was successful, as 64% of the voters did yes at the referendum according to official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted by gender, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were put to the vote.
The draft Constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two surveys at the exit of the polls and the calculation carried out by a civil society have shown a huge surplus of 'yes' votes by 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke of the victory of his draft constitution on Sundays to Monday.
"The Constitution has given its first victory," he said, and he thanked the people of the EGs at the headquarters of Guayaquil, which is 280 kilometers south of Quitó.
As well as the well-known, Mr. Chávez, Mr Morales and the President of Chile congratulated Michelle Bachele.
According to the report of the Watching Mission of the Organisation of the United States of America (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444 accurate text, which brought together the principles of the new socialism protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution confers state power on the economy, maintaining the right of the State to "design" the development of a country that essentially lives from oil production by foreign companies and from the exchange sent by migrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also confirms the power of the Head of State, who can obtain mandates for a maximum of two consecutive periods, and is entitled to subtract the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that she wishes to live with this opportunity and is re-competitive for the Head of State in February 2009.
The Constitution also included freedom of health services and education.The President has already begun to introduce this in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half the population lives below the minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of the ECU facility in the framework of US anti-drug measures.
Released in the 19 hostages in Chad
Egypt's commando has hit him on the kidnappers who have taken 11 tourists hostage ten days ago and their eight escorts.
The hostages are in Cairo now.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported intactly to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released during the morning in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, around 4:30 p.m., aircraft arrived at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the international airport in Cairo.
The hostages were banned to report to the press and immediately moved to a hospital in the district of Cairo, near Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers were "not paid ransom" - said Zoheir Garanna, Egyptian tourist minister at the airport.
The hostages were arrested on September 19, 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in the field safari.
There were 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour leaders, four drivers, a border guard and a Safari travel office in Aegeptous.
According to an Egyptian security officer, a special team of 30 members arrived on two helicopters at the scene where they were hit right before the flood on the hostages.
"There was a firefight between the troops. Half the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said the leader who asked for his name's silence.
He also stated that a total of 150 members had been sent from the Villam of Egypt to Sudan, where German and Italian commanders were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We need to know that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective involvement of our secret service men and action groups", he said, without any further details.
He also denied paying ransom for hostages.
On the day before, the Sudanese army announced that during the patrol, they arrested an outposter on which the kidnappers were traveling. Six were killed (including the Czech leader) and two were arrested.
According to the army, the hostages were in contact with a rebel organization in Darfur, the SLA-U, who was immediately disapproved by the organization concerned.
Lettres - The "Current Most" of culture
There is currently a debate on the financing of culture at the heart of newspapers and the current election campaign.
We're just happy for that.
But they're still forgetting a piece of our cultural life.
Who will lift his word to illustrate the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archeological monuments and national historical monuments at the edge of the famine?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings forming part of his cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government only spent three and a half million euros to restore the Castle Chinon in the Loire Valley?
And the Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Federation of Québec Historical Societys (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40 000 volunteers from the company dealing with history, cultural heritage, archeology and genetics are working to preserve a large number of private archive and archeological findings, with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our heritage with teeth and protest with the final power of the drowning when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeterys.
When are you going to stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
They're cleaning up part of Fortis's bank in Benelux governments
By partial nationalisation, the Benelux Member States have been in trouble as the first European institution in Belgium, the Fortison, with a total amount of EUR 11,2 billion in support of the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed on the case at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s responsible for competition.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis over a period of more than one year in the wave, and the decisions taken on the bank can therefore be considered to be of some precision.
According to the decision adopted on Sunday night, all three states purchase their existing assets in nearly half (49 percent) of them.
The bank will certainly sell part of its interest, including, above all, insurance activities purchased from the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
In the last week, Fortis's shares began to fall steeply, and in the second half of the week, there have already been serious crises at the Institute.
However, they agree with the fact that with 85 thousand employees the bank is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The company's papers fell only on Friday by about 12 percent, to a 14-year-old point.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to corporate managers this is not realistic.
By the way, management has caused market uncertainties over the overseas market relating to the adoption of the $700 billion US package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers rose slightly.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx appointed a new CEO to the head of the bank.
The financial institution was looking for private buyers, but no one's ever made any offers.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, do not lose their money.
There was no panic among the clients of the bank, and the accounts were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and has also purchased leasing companies.
Roka in the Henkol
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of their drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme which binds to the consent of the person concerned in all cases the use of prescription data.
It's supposed to be independent, or we're going to put the hen bag on the fox," quotes Richard Dick, the developer of the drug prescription program, Washington Post.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance premium and the amount in the event of damages dependent on the health status of the applicant customer, and if the risk is too high, they shall not be insured.
They used to send the person to a medical exam, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Dick has been a much cheaper procedure for ten years: from pharmacists, he easily acquires from his client’s identification number what his or her medications were purchased in the last year and a result of his or her medical condition.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol lowering, it suggests that your blood fat level is virtually untreated, which is classified in a higher risk category immediately.
Several versions of the programme are available in the market, some of which also defines risk coefficients, so the insurance company will not be able to do anything outside the paper work, although there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages include that some medicines may be used for several purposes, such as certain compounds may be used against migraines or heat waves, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is a risk increase factor that is relevant to business insurance companies, and the latter is not.
The data were collected and processed by special companies, and before I could obtain the necessary information from the pharmacists, they ask for the patient's consent.
They are now bound by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are now working on the results of laboratory tests and connecting them to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of the use is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a special health data protection law, but it applies only to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Before the convention, there is a proposal for a law that gives the authorities control over companies specialising in the provision of information.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his programme, which would contribute to the express consent of the concerned to the transmission of the data.
Another question is that the sex concerned may refuse the contribution, otherwise the insurance undertakings do not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are all referenced to the benevolence of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
Double trade between the European Union and India
As the European Union and India's mutually leading trading partners, the agenda for the ninth summit was also dominated by this issue, with the rest, largely, of the global problem.
Today it will also be the French-India summit, where it will mainly be about nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union acknowledges that India is a rising democratic power which should be given greater input in international matters, but Member States have not yet succeeded in reaching a common denominator to support its permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was thus not addressed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
Mr Sarkozy, French President of the Union, Mr Sarkozy, and Mr Barroso, President of the Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs of Javier Solarana, accepted Mr Manmohan Szingh, Indian Prime Minister, with whom they agreed to double the trade turnover over five years, i.e. to a large amount of EUR 100 billion.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious objective.
In this respect, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions with India have been brought together in a legal sense, i.e. air traffic may flow in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the settlement.
The aim is to balance that, while the EU is India's first trading partner, Newdelhi is only in the ninth place in the line of EU partners.
The summit has devoted attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - the latter from both parts have been condemned in all forms and have called for the United Nations Conference to be convened.
They also called for the completion of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large part of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will maintain its energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce harmful emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
It also agreed, as was the case with India, that a global agreement should be concluded at the climate conference for the future, and that the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 % by 2050.
I would also like to prevent food prices from rising and have supported the international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where he is about to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In Paris, they trust that French companies will receive an order to build Indian nuclear reactors of €20 billion.
According to intelligence reports, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers represent themselves in a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the most significant international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair has 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, in a square area of 171.790, where more than 403,000 books are presented.
At the opening ceremony in Italy, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of Ministry of Culture javak and Activities: Italy, through the establishment of a single Italian Point, will include a field of exhibition of 264 square meters.
The ceremony will be followed by a press conference to be held in the room of the Pávilón of Buchmesse 5.0 "Rom Struktur", where data, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian book publishing will also be presented.
According to the data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
They found Steve Fosset's plane, a billionaire missing a year ago.
The remains of Steve Fossett's billionaire plane were found, which disappeared on September 3, 2007 over the Nevada desert.
The wrecks were found on a 3,000-metre high plain, near Mammoth Lakes, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains along the California and Nevada border.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Madeira County Sheriff, all the remaining doubts have been removed: "We sent a team after the flight position was established, and now we can be sure that it was about the plane that Steve Fosset was flying on the day of his disappearance", said a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billion-year-old was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (NSTSB) reported that a few hours after the wreck was discovered, an examination committee was requested to identify the machine and to establish that it was indeed about the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on 3 September 2007 on the day Fosset started a three-hour flight from Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday he also found some of Fosset's personal things near the border of Nevada, near the home of Mammoth Lakes.
Two IDs for Fosset's name, issued by the Federal Aviation Inspectorate of Illinois, some cash and a sweater.
His search for Fosset was handed up a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks, through which he added himself to history.
In 2002, for the sixth try, he was first able to fly around the ground with a balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he was on a plane to land without landing.
Many of his records include the flight above the Andes, at a height of 15.445 m, performed by a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
It's an unusual, but original and determined hobby with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, Mercedes-Benz is the newest "compatible road stopper" that the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
This makes the introduction campaign for SUV GLK in Mercedes-Benz presentation rooms surprising and unusual as of October 17 due to its traditional content.
The same commercial campaign accompanying the introduction of a new vehicle is using a media-communication tool that has so far been unknown, including by means of post-sympathic 3D posters that have not been used in Italy by car brand.
The giant plakat action, which consists of three stages, will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, the Corso Como, by 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins by presenting the car with a space effect, whereby the new SUV, the special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be almost in real shape and in three-dimensional form.
The person who looks at the picture will feel like the car's getting out of the poster.
Then, through the innovative Lifemina8 technology, each detail of the new GLK becomes visible, and then it becomes a single way.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry with this promotion.
Is it possible to get interested in future customers?
We'll show you who are the Italian football players.
They're probably out of orbit.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who are now ashamed of all Italy? Members of the Ultras Italy group, which has been following the selection for years, and which, according to truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never got into a fight with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right.
The majors are coming from Trivento.
And Verona, Padova, Trieste, and Udina.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller groups of sores from Campania and Puglia (of course only a few units).
Italian flags were flying, on which the home town of the fans had been identified: on Saturday they were removed so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, you've faced a real Nazi cheerleading team with the Levski drukkers.
The Italian football industry made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These were tickets to name, making it easier to check the Surcolo team.
The Ministry of the Interior also controlled everyone: there was no one in between those preparing for Sofia to intervene, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a record of football have refused tickets and departures.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior is waiting for protocols from the Sofia Police Department and then takes the necessary measures: the fans who have been arrested or identified in the course of the riots may also be killed by a five-year ban.
This is an international ban, which covers not only the visit of Italy, but also all of Europe's stadiums.
So our football leagues can't put their feet on any football field.
Lucky for me.
But we must also fear that the Huligans will find followers, that is, that only one hundred and fifty people will join.
"There's no need to excuse anyone who behaves like this," said the Ministry of Home Affairs.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since we're approaching Wednesday's selected match day in Lecce.
In Puglia, a smaller cell supporting Italian ultretres is working.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and on Tuesday, the Safety of Sports Events will be discussed by the Committee, which may also be expected to be part of a department of Internal Security, to provide secret services for the activities of the Surcolo.
"Duce-Duce's scant arm under the Italian hymn? "It's not a crime in Bulgaria."
This thought was expressed in a rather unfortunate way by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to the attention service of the Ministry of Interior (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was former chief police commander of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting Ultras Italy has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true is not allowed to feed the Duce in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of that 150-200 smuggler was a shame.
I'm not a sociology, he's the first person in the observation service, but the crimes need to be judged in the country where the crime is committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems, and we need to examine exactly what happened and consider how further.
But let's also talk a little bit about the Italian hymnism: it's not a crime, but, if I may say that, it can't be called well-being."
