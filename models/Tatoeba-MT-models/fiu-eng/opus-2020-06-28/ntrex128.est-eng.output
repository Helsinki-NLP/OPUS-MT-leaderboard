Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are divided from the recommendation to make their appointments MWP (member of the Welsh Parliament of the Wales Parliament).
The theme has begun to turn the name of the National Assembly into the Wales Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this may lead to ridicule.
One member of the National Assembly of Leipzignists said that his groupmates are concerned, as it is conjureed with the words “Twp and Pwp”.
To explain to readers outside Wales: The word daft in millenish means bourgeois and pwp means kaka.
A member of the platform said that the whole group “is not happy” and has proposed other names.
A member of the Wales Conservatory Party said that his group views the change of name "responsively", but noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "Muppet".
To explain: The star's w pronunciation is similar to the English language of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drawing up a draft law on change of name, said: "The final decision on all the names of which the members of the National Assembly are invited, of course, is made by the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry on proposals for name, which widely supports the idea of the National Assembly to refer to Wales as Parliament.
As regards the appointment of members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the term ‘WMP’, or ‘WMP’, but the most favoured option ‘MWP’ was the public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge to President Elin Jones, who should submit a draft law on changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee System.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly shall remain to the members at the hearing of the legislative act.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on the appointment of their country as the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is organised with the aim of resolving for decades a dispute with Greece, a neighbouring country with its province of Macedonia.
Athens has long said that the name of her northern neighbour represents the requirement in that territory and has repeatedly objected to the application of the EU and NATO as a member.
The Macedonian President, Mr Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the name change, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, the parties to the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, claim that the change in name is only a price that the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's watches are quiet because the churches of Harlem are in trouble.
"The older people I've talked to, they've said that there was an old bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"I'm not one of them."
He said the loss of bars is understandable.
“Mans communicate differently these days, ” he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighbourhood living rooms where people are present every day."
As far as churches are concerned, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last for as long as the leaders hope, and “earlier or later they will be back at the beginning”.
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings full of people who do not pass assistance to the remaining saints of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he added, "who are therefore speeding up the day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white churches before Harlemis became a black metropolis — the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the Holy Martin Church ten years later.
The original White Methodists congregation left in the 1930 ’ s.
A congregation of black people who had worshiped God so far took over the property of the building.
A congregation of African Americans in the tribe of St. Martin's Church with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against the 125th Street store of Harlem, who refused to hire or promote the black people.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the members of the Father Johnson congregation planned to restore the building, they put in place a cartel or clock game.
Father Johnson's son and co-author at St Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson named the charilion with pride "the clocks of the poor people".
However, the expert who played the charilion in jurisprudence gave another name: "cultural value" and "unreplaceable historical tool".
He also noted from the University of Tiffany Ng Michigan that it was the world's first charilion, played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a bigger charlion at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said the Holy Martin Church didn't replace him.
In recent months in St Martin's church, there has been a respect for architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by the secular leaders of the church, other bishops.
In July, the congregation’s governing body of secular leaders complained in writing to the Bishop that the Bishop “will seek to pass on expenses,” although the office did not even involve hiring architects and contractors sent by the Bishop.
Some members complained about the poor transparency of the bishop’s actions.
In California, the shark injured a boy who had fallen for a 13-year-old lobster.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived in California on the opening day of the lobster season for the lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that his friends had been diving around half an hour this Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help and then swam around with the others to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought at first that the boy expressed his encouragement at the reception of the lobster, but “he realized that the boy shouted “I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
The whole of his shoulderbone was undressed," Hammel described the sight he saw when he got to the boy.
"I told everyone they would come out of the water, "There is a shark in the water," added Hammel.
In a life-threatening situation, the boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of sharks attacked is unknown to date.
At the press conference Captain Larry Giles said that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours from Casablad to Swamini for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that more than 135 shark species exist in the region, but most of them are not considered to be hazardous.
Sainsbury's plans to take power of the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' chains, creating super-marketed beauty intermediates, where experts also work.
As part of an important entrant to the UK’s GBP 2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to increase in sales of fashion and home goods, the wider ranges of beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country, taking them, if successful, also in other shops next year.
Beauty products are invested because supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the previously isolated shelf space for televisions, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said that it plans to double up to 3000 products, including for the first time also trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing product options from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also provide more room in brand areas, which are currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-market its makeup series Boutique, where most products are suitable for Vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test the exclusive sales license in the two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and switching to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets must try more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, has said that sales sites are starting to look more and more like supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against cheap sales chains like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitats' sales sites since Sainsbury bought both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food goods and made acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier Supermarket attempt to upgrade its beauty and medical products departments ended with failure.
Sainsbury experimented with Boots at the beginning of the 2000 ’ s, but it ended with a dispute about how to share the income from selling pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
A new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281 son to the pharmaceutical business three years ago for 125 million pounds for Celesio, which includes the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds, adding its four shops to the product range of luxury leather care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury's, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty intermediates to improve the environment around our customers.
We have also spent money on special training workers who are always ready to advise.
Our trade mark selection meets all the needs. The lushing environment and comfortable locations mean, however, that we are now a competitive destination for beauty trade, which can change old ways of buying."
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up on 11 million pounds of deal.
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones left “indiscreetly” when the TV driver Holly Willoughby gave up his 11 million-dollar deal in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's trademark of domestic goods and clothing.
A couple of business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old director of the TV show "This Morning" reported his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den in the middle of Peter Jones's anger by stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source said that Jones was a "maruvihane" when the star girl of television admitted at an intense meeting held on Tuesday at the Man's Business Empire headquarters at Marlows Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts at the value of GBP 1.5 million mean that she no longer had enough time to commit herself to the trademark of domestic clothing and clothing.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated value of GBP 11 million.
When a 37-year-old Willoughby reported on Instagram leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for his vacation home.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main priority.
It had to ensure his distant future, so she thought she was doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything in full confusion.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
There's a warehouse in Marlow headquarters full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the departure of the leader of the television show "This Morning", one of the highest paid fames in Britain, can pay millions of dollars to the company, because products with a choice of sofas and candles and clothing from the sofas and the home clothes have been invested in a rich amount of money, and this could also lead to the subsequent placing of the product on the market.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
Couples go on holiday trips and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's teleproduction company.
Willoughby will be M&S branded and he will replace Ant McPartlin's ITV series in "I'm A Celebraty".
One of Jones' close sources said last night: “I do not want to comment on his business matters.”
It's hard to talk, "because what we fell in love"
Trump was joking about the criticism that was directed in news to him for comments that some considered "the President worthless" and excessive positive about the North Korean Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, "with the sound of his mocking "renewing screw":
"I have not given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting since Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the surrender of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
But the negotiations on the surrender of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea said to the leaders of the world of Ri Yong Ho on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see the US "an appropriate response" to the original disarmament steps of North Korea.
It noted that the US would continue with pressure restrictions.
Trump's cheering angle was a lot more exciting.
"We're going very well with North Korea," he said.
“The war with North Korea was about to start.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now we're all very good."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced good results: finished rocket tests, were designed to release hostages and have been organised to bring American servants' remains home.
He also protected his unusual communication with Kim.
"It's very easy to be a president, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get to that filled stadium, it's better if we have nearly 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd before him.
Tsunam and earthquake destroy Indonesian island, kill hundreds of people
When the consequences of the Lombok earthquake were eliminated, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboki population had to be relocated, a national disaster was not declared a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
“In Kahjuk they have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international aid, so that the stories are a little complicated,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the organization Save the Children sets up a team to go to Palusse, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the area.
Pressman of the National Disaster Office, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palus in order to decide whether international authorities are allowed to contribute.
Given the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has been surprisingly low in preparation to deal with the natural force.
Although they have been built in Aceh for the tsunami, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given to the tsunami, the apparent absence of a sirene of tsunami was likely to increase the number of those who died.
Traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging during the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that stopped in Lomboki to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed to Paluss, but it takes at least three days to arrive at the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure into a central part of its election campaign and has allocated money to roads and railways.
However, the budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government to the extent that new elections will be held next year.
Mr Jokot’s tensions in Indonesia are also being pressured by the dissidents, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to a more ancient form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fight between Christian and Muslim forces in the streets where machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons were used.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge beats the violin gate in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Chelsea from Liverpool's loss in Premier League, cutting off the 89th game mound in Stamford Bridge, a Saturday-station game in London.
Sturridge received a feed from Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 meters away from Chelsea Gate when his team led 1 : 0.
He hit the ball to the left before he hit it in a further direction.
The ball flew high across the penalty zone and hit the top right corner of the net.
It fell over with the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I just wanted to get a position like this, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much forward as possible, so I just tried to win for myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge on the page of LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made one touch, and gave me a longer thought without thinking."
At the end of the first semester, Chelsea 1 :0 thanks to the 25th playback, Belgian star Eden Toord led to the gate.
Blues' attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovac before he turned around on the middle field and swung to Liverpool.
Kovac gave me a quick meal on the middle field.
Then he created a beautiful air-tight, leading him to the punishment area of Toord.
Homer got through the defense and hit the net with his left foot from Liverpool player Alison Becker in the direction of a mail in the distance.

The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
In Indonesia, the earthquake and tsunami deaths rose to 832, said the National Disaster Office on Sunday morning.
The Hulk people were trapped on Friday and the giant waves of 18 metres brought under the fists of the collapsed buildings due to the earthquake of 7.5-magnetics, said pressman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the press conference.

The body of a woman 44 years old was found at 07:55 in the morning at Grayson Mewsis John Street.
Police are calling to contact people in the area who might have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The fall is only quite early, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw something suspicious, to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially the cab drivers, who could have recorded something, to contact us because they may have essential information for our investigation."
The police spokesperson confirmed that a woman found in one of the buildings was Birkenhead's local resident.
This afternoon, the woman’s alleged friends asked questions about where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said they're now informing her of her close relatives.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was impressed when he heard about the case.

The shape of Parliament's Cromwell is the last monument that is the cause of the "rewrote of history" dispute
To eliminate it would be a credible justice for the devastation of so many English cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style that man’s inhumans followers did.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate on the elimination of images, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to lose the memorial before Westminster’s palace.
Cromwell didn't rob pictures of himself in the British Civil War or tell others to do so.
Maybe they sacrificed the wrong Cromwell man for the actions of Thomas in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history description of the person who, in the opinion of many people, should continue to pay tribute to."
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people were considered to be the defender of the Cromwell Parliament at the end of the 19th century, and in this case, of course, from the royal authorities.
Whether this is a precise reflection is an infinite historical dispute.
It is certain that the battle in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents this gap on one side.
His achievements as Lord Kaputs also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
The killer was knocked dead by a Chinese farmer.
According to local media records, in Edela-China, a farmer was attacked by a pig who killed the man.
A man identified only by his last name, Yuan, was found dead and covered with blood from the village of Liupanhui near the market in Guizhou, reported the South Chinese newspaper Morning Post on Sunday.
Manufacture of pigs in China on 30 May 2005 at Xiningis Qinghai Province, China for vaccination of pigs in his desk.
Apparently, on Wednesday, he had come from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the man’s cousin found him dead and discovered that the next block was open.
He said the inside was a big, bloody sore.
The investigation of forensics confirmed that the 249,47 kilograms [249,47 kg] of sorcery had reportedly destroyed the farmer.
“My stupid feet were all bloody and shot,” reported the witch Wu’s words in the victim’s “Guiyang Evening News. ”
Security footage showed that Yuan entered the market Thursday morning at 04:40 a.m. to feed his pig.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The man killed neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he wouldn't be able to attack anyone else until he collected evidence at the police scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly discussing the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rare, it has been observed earlier that pigs attack people.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a 294,83 kg pig nailed the tractor of the Wales farmer until the man's wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, when one of the farmers ate his own pigs, Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs would not normally be attacked, but because of the taste of blood, it might be bad for their heads.
"They're just playing games.
They're very curious maracrats, whose aim is not to hurt them.
They just need to be respected enough," said the man.
The after-winds of the Orcan Rosa bring large rainfalls in the south-east of the United States
According to the predictions, Rosa will weaken the hurricane, moving across Mexico towards cooler waters.
Still, Rosa will bring rainstorms that are floating across North Mehiko and the U.S.A. in the near future.
On Sunday morning at 05:00, the time of the East Coast, Rosa was classified as the first category of hurricane with winds of 136.78 km per hour, ranging from 619.59 km east to Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure on the Pacific is emerging, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm Baja California peninsula on Monday, it begins to direct a deep tropical moisture towards the south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will reach Mexico, where it will rain up to 25,4 centimetres.
Thereafter, the tropical humidity that reacts to the approaching low-pressure will produce extensive strong rain lights in the south-east of the country in the coming days.
At times, between 2.54 and 10.16 centimetres are caused by dangerous rainfalls, floodwater and possible paints in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall from five to about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that between 5,08 and 10,16 centimetres of rain in certain parts of the U.S.A., particularly in Arizona.
There is a potential for sudden deterioration of tropical rains.
Certainly should not move on foot in the desert in the event of the risk of tropical rainfalls.
Strong rain can cause canyons to become fast-flowed rivers and thunderstorms with at times explosive winds and floating dust.
A close low-pressure environment will lead to acute rainfalls in the southern California coasts.
It is possible to have a total rainfall of more than 1.27 centimetres and may cause lower flood water and a slipper of you.
This would be the first rainfall of the region during the rainy season.
The broken tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, the rainfalls become extensive on Monday night and Tuesday.
Strong rainfalls reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, large variations in temperature are predicted in the US due to the cooling of the Arctic, while the temperature in tropical areas remains high.
Sometimes this leads to large changes in temperature in small areas.
The Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant differences in temperature in central U.S.
The differences in temperature between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omara (Nebraska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) reach almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he's trying to recover from long summer heat.
A large part of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with large temperatures of 80 degrees ranging from the south to the north-east part of the country.
In New York, 26.6 degrees of heat are expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that there is a likelihood of high average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial looked at over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched, on Thursday, six television channels, the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who allegedly accused of sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
At the same time, the political impasse continued, where broadcasters interrupted the presentation of traditional broadcasts to reflect last minute rounds on Friday: Senator Jeff Flake signed an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate to the Legal Commission that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh scratched him with his head and tried to tear his clothes off at the high school prom.
Kavanaugh said in his church confession that it was absolutely certain that it didn't happen.
On Friday, more than 20.4 million people were likely to watch the transfer, according to Nielsen’s report.
The company calculated the average viewer population on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems with the calculation of the number of people who look at transfers at the authorities.
In comparison, it is about the same large audience as football final tournament games or Oscars.
The Fox News Channel opinion leaders, who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day session, said Nielsen.
ABC 3,26 million viewers left behind.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
The interest remained great after the trial.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After a statement by the moderate Republican Bureau that he was voting for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit the man Friday morning when he had been caught in the guise of protesters, trying to go with the elevator to the trial of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
He stood his eyes on the ground for several minutes when he was accused and directly transferred to CNN.
"I'm standing right here, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are totally under control.”
Flake said that his department issued an application and added before closing the elevator that he had more to say at the sitting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks reflected a direct transmission several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to send Kavanaugh to the Senate for voting.
But Flake said that he only does this in his understanding that the FBI will investigate next week's allegations against the candidate, which have been demanded by the democrats in the minority.
Flake convinced some of the conversation with a friend of the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with the Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact because it was obvious that the Republicans would not get the votes of Kavanaugh without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation in connection with Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit's critics for political action
The Prime Minister accused those who criticize his plans to leave the European Union, the "political game" of the future of Britain and the damage to national interest in the interview given to the Sunday Times.
Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conference of the Conservatory Party in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper Theresa May with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson put pressure on his attack on May so to speak about the Brexit strategy, saying that the proposal that Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs is "fully free of brain".
Shots fired by Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
The police arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims killed.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison under second degree murder, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, informed the CBS on the TV channel WAFB.
After Simpson's questioning, the police said that he confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
The lawyer reported that a man's bail was set at USD 350 000 (308 600.30).
On Friday, East Baton Rouge's coronator issued a preliminary report saying that death was caused by a gunshot wound in the head of the neck.
The department thanks the State Police Task Force of Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and the people living in the region for their assistance in the investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
The director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the district's law enforcement agencies for "care and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A man of 1,98 metres grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
His last season of games averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 tables.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball director Will Wade said that the whole team was "stamped" and "scraped" because of Wayde's death.
"That's something you worry about all the time," said Wade.
There's ash in the volcano over Mexico City.
The volcano-breaking ash of Popotepetl has reached the southernmost parts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans, telling them to stay away from the volcano, as another activity began in the crate, resulting in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash destruction recorded in the course of 24 hours.
The center has a number of myriads and tremors.
In social media, the shared images represented the front of a ash-coated car in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilcos.
Geophysics noticed an increase in volcanic activity of 72 km from the capital after a 7,1-magnetic earthquake shaking the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano named Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police have collisions with Catalonia separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after a conflict of independent protestors with the mountain police. Thousands joined the protests to celebrate the opposing vote against Catalonia on exit.
A group of masqueraded fighters who were held back by the mountain police attacked the latter with eggs and powder paint, creating a thick dust cloud on streets that are usually full of tourists.
There were also attacks later when the police had to use the waffles to control the fights.
Several hours of “No neglect, no forgiveness,” sang the supporters of independence collided with those who supported the unity of the state, who called “Elagu Spain!".
According to the local press, 14 people who received minor injuries received medical attention.
In the area which supports independence, the EU’s efforts continue to play a role one year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which were still marked by the Catalans in favour of the separation.
The voters decided in favour of independence, although voting activity was low, because those who opposed the suspension were largely ignoring the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote from being held in front of the polls in the region, which led to violent conflicts.
The supporters of independence had been staying in front of the polls on Friday night to avoid protests that supported the national police.
However, the reminders took place, but they had to take another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in a divorce protest with his wife, said that he no longer had the chance to see Catalonia as independent.
“One of the best moments of our lives took place last year.
I saw my parents crying out for the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite important but small elections in December of the previous year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting the independence of Catalan to maintain this year, since many of the most well-known leaders have either gone into exile or have been held up and are waiting for their part in the holding of a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who record a demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the fight was driven by politicians from behind.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junquera, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who has been in the pre-investigation prison from the previous year, announced that he will take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The candidate for elections in the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the restoration of democratic values and the Spanish Government's statements of pressure," he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car was hit by a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car in Londonderry had been repeatedly bombed.
The incident took place at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. on British time.
Detective Bob Blemmmmings said the damage was committed to the gates and the building.
They might also have let the vibunol in the direction of the car at some point.
Menga blows Livingston 1-0 wins in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gate for Livingston was behind winning
The promoted Livingston kidnapped the Rangers to take Steven Gerrard to second loss in 18 games when the man has been the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's blow proved to be decisive when Gary Holt raised the level in seconds to Hiberni.
Gerrard will win this season in the first league of strangers and will meet the leading Hearts on Sunday, eight points in the ground.
Before that, the Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euroliga.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his undefeated attack to seven games, while the head coach Holt still felt the taste of losing from the month before Kenny Miler changed.
Livingston loses opportunity for the Nüri visitors
The Holt team should have led long before they hit the gate, since their direct style of play caused any problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts ran out in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made his efforts to hit Craig Halkett's headlines across the gate.
Visitors calmly let Rangers play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors in certain places.
And that's also the way they hit the defining gate.
Rangers gave up the free shot and Livingston had a chance to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in doing it in the middle of the penalty.
By this time the Rangers were mainly in the ball, but were unable to penetrate the defense, so the gater was mostly calm on Liam Kelly's side.
The same pattern continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the gate one time.
The Rangers gater Allan McGregor rejected Scott Pittsburgh's blow and Lithgow shined brightly in another team job in Livingston.
The attacks were constantly reached the criminal area of Livingston and were repeatedly thrown away, and two were also directed away, one by Halketti Glenn Middleton's attempt to replace him and one by touching the ball.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland at the Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaron Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, crossing the ladder upwards, moving fully to expectations.
Their style of play and players have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt needs to be respected for how he has escaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, organising excellently organized protection while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time in the back legs.
But the Rangers got inspired.
Notwithstanding their intermediate good level under Gerrard’s leadership, this was limited in the light of the examples here.
Their final possession proved to be incomplete: there was only one time to reach the home side that could function as a alarm clock for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Contradictive reception of Erdogan in Köln
In Berlin, on Saturday (29 September), both smiles and troubleshoots were met when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been set aside for issues concerning human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan Köln headed to open a new giant moose.
The largest Turkish community outside Turkey is in the city.
The police referred to security by banning the gathering of 25 000 members in front of the moshe, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
hundreds of people opposed Erdogan, a large part of whom is deaf, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to host the Turkish President in their country.
The competing demonstrations show that the attitude toward the guest is divided: some of the Turks in Germany greet him as a hero, while others despise the man as self - control.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: a bicycle killed as a result of a car crash
In London, a motorcyclist was killed.
The collision took place on a quick road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, about 10:15 in the southeast of the city according to British summer time.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to give the ambulances, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred a few months after the other biker died in the crash about two kilometers from Saturday’s crash on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the bike ran off the scene.
The police in London said the authorities are working on identifying a man and informing him of his loved ones.
The traffic is closed and buses are redirected, drivers of motor vehicles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six prison officials were injured in disturbances
The prison office reported that six prison officials were injured in the riots in a very secure man's prison.
The riots broke out at his Majesty Long Lartin prison at Worcestershire at 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, after the British summer season, and haven't finished yet.
The concentration of unrest in one wing, involving eight prisoners, is involved in the work of experts in mountain police.
The prison officials were treated with milder facial injuries at the scene.
The spokesperson of the prison service said: “Various prison staff are invited to resolve an ongoing case in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, it is transferred to the police, and their imprisonment may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was informed that he was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, we were invited to go to prison to silence the serious disturbances that were attacked by prison officials with pool balls.
Oran Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden shocks (can be useful for the main areas)
The tropical low pressure is not often hit by Arizona, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the shaking hurricane Rosa moves across the U.S. Southeast desert, bringing about a sudden threat.
The National Air Service has already organised a follow-up on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, in the southern and eastern part of Nevada, in California and Utah districts, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the prophecy, Rosa will head for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region with rainfalls on Monday.
The Phoenix National Air Service states that “only ten tropical cyclones have been stored in Phoenix at a radius of 321,86 km [31,86 km] of tropical storm or low pressure level since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane which passed 64,37 miles from the border of Arizona."
The latest National Orcan Centre models predict rainfalls of between 5,08 and 10,16 centimetres, which can range from 15,24 centimetres in the limited areas of Arizona Mogollon Rim.
In other desert areas of the U.S. Eden, including the central part of the Rock Mountains and the large body, the number of rainfalls is likely to be between 2.54 and 5.08 centimetres, extending in limited areas to 10.16 centimetres.
Rosa’s rainfalls may be a blessing to the problem of drought areas.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfalls are likely to be beneficial as droughts exist in South-East America.
According to the U.S. lawn monitor, at least 40% of Arizona's extreme or second-larged droughts are reported by Weather.com.
First of all, Rosa Baja's California half-saar in Mexico's land.
Rosa, which was still on Sunday morning with the largest windmills of 6,43 km per hour, is now 619,95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at a speed of 19,31 kilometers north of Mexico.
The storm is in contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific, which is why it's a little slowing down.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will reach Mexico with the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rains in certain Mexican regions may be high, bringing about a significant risk of flooding.
“Baja from California to Sonora’s north-east part can be expected for rainfalls of between 7,62 and 15,24 centimetres, at locations up to 25,4 centimetres,” informed Weather.com.
Next, Rosa is heading north of the tropical storm in Mexico, reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low-pressure family moving across Arizona and reaching the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main threat that follows or follows Rosa is very strong rainstorms in Baja California, the north of Sonora and the south of the United States,” said the National Oran Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden and flooding in the deserts and paints in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area at Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British Summer Time.
The victim was taken to a hospital in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials are asking for contact with anyone who might have a case of cell phone recordings.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered" the Democratic Party under “of evil and anger”
“The support of the President Kavanaugh is the voice of the Democratic Party against the merciless and unacceptable tactics,” said Trump in his speech on the cheering speech of Wheelingus in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “took” during the process of appointment of the Democratic Party under “the influence of evil and anger”.
Kavanaugh made statements before Congress on Thursday, queezing sharply and emotionally back Christine Blasey Ford's accusations, according to which the man attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that "America saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day".
The vote given for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is to appoint one of the most valuable legal experts of our time who have an impeccable background in public service," he said to the people in favour of Western Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the electoral activity of the Republic in the interim elections.
Five weeks have remained one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not running for you, but actually I'm running for you," he said.
"That is why I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission designed to "severe and prevent".
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor on the application of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, said the senior relief of the heads of the Republics' party to CNN.
Thousands have been killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of deaths is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, and many were proud to hear, after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Sulawes island in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered together on Friday at the beach festival in Palu, when at the right time, they created six - foot waves on the beach, killed a lot of people and destroyed everything that remained on the road.
Tsunam was followed by 7.5 Magnitural earthquakes.
“When the tsunami began yesterday, people were still on the beach doing their own thing, not running away from it as soon as they became victims,” said BNB pressman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the press conference in Jakarta, Indonesia.
“Tsunam did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses, sweeping everything from the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved on the high seas at 800 km per hour before it reached the shore.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 headquarters.
Air photos published by the Disaster Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and crushed bridges and water-based mossies.
The conclusions of the coastal city continued on Saturday.
In a region with 2.4 million inhabitants there was a wave of earthquakes.
In its statement BPPT, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released after a strong earthquake was nearly 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb that fell into Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city at the far and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “sensory” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that some of the victims' bodies were found under the roofs of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the dead may be larger in the coastal area north of Palus 300 km north called Donggala, which was closer to the summer of the earthquake.
The announcements from Donggala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300 000 inhabitants in the region," said the Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
"This is already a tragedy that could get worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in Palu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach while the alert was issued.
The amateur cabinets in social media show a man on the top floor of a building, warning panicously moving people about the tsunami approaching the street.
A few minutes later, the waterwall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars.
Reuters failed to confirm the accuracy of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major electrical failure which prevented the communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue work.
The military has started sending transport planes to help Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities, but the evacuations still need food and other essentials.
The airport in town was reopened for rescue work, remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of those killed by the Indonesian tsunami rose by more than 800.
That's really bad.
Although the workers of the World Vision arrived safely from Donggala in the City of Palu, where they were hidden in the presentations set up in their office’s courtyard, they saw the gloomy views on their way, said Mr. Dosheba.
"They said you saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's really bad.
Although the aid forces began to operate forcefully to mitigate the disaster, some of the workers with great experience from foreign aid organisations were prevented from travelling to Paluss.
According to the Indonesian rules, foreign funding, supplies and aid forces can only be sent if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This continues to be a disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, press spokesperson for the Red Cross, Indonesia.
"When the government says, "Okay, it's a national disaster," we can start to receive international aid, but that position hasn't yet been announced."
When the second night came upon prayer after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends of the lost people and families were still full of hope that their loved ones would be the wonderful events that ease the fall of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was raised out of the sewer well.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped two days outside her mother's body under fists.
In Indonesia, the National Liquors team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing sliders for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of us trapped in Roa Roa's hotel are his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
“I have a personal burden as a senior slipper, ” he said.
Mr Gendon talked about how, following the spread of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the liblaglers' community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the citizens of Palu who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think that means that the messages did not reach," he said.
Vargas took 23 585.88 euros at the time of the ATM on Newport at the Levees
On Friday morning, the thieves stole Newport from the British staff who filled the Levees ATM, €23 585.88, published in the Newport Police Department press release.
The driver emptyed the ATM in the entertainment establishment and produced more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in press release.
When the man acted, “the other man behind the British employee” and stole the bag for delivery, full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, writing a press release, but police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All persons with information on early persons are invited to contact the Newport Police by phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will call his new name Ye
Räppar Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
On Saturday's Twitter change, the man wrote: "Previously Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye with a nickname for a while, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change takes place before his performance at the Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to publish his new album in Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grandet, who cancelled his concert with "the sense of feeling", said the author.
In addition to the shortcoming of the man’s current nickname, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance to him.
"I think that "yes" is one of the most used words in the Bible, which means "I" there," said West earlier, discussing the name of the radio broadcaster Big Boy with his album.
"That's where I am you, I'm us, it's us.
I changed my name from Kanya, meaning “one” to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
Album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West isn't the only rapper playing his name.
Sean Combs is known mainly as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician reported that he preferred names of Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also used his name with a sense of thought and without it, with big and small stars.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military forces against civilians
At a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of blood attacks against students, the Mexican presidential candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use force against civilians.
On Sunday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plazas that “will never use military force to control the Mexicans”.
On October 2, 1968, the military attacked a peaceful protest on the field, killing 300 people while the whole of Latin America was carrying the left-hand movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and by opening up more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people towards criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount to be allocated to research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and a professional with artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after the various parts of the US Government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an overall formal artificial intelligence strategy.
At the same time, China presented its plan last year to be a player of industrial intelligence renewal by 2030.
"The duplication of the telecommunications research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US, and we are acting on behalf of the next industrial intelligence breakthrough," said Lee.
Double funding would double the probability that the next major technological intelligence was achieved in the United States, said Lee CNBC in the interview given this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the best American Othello player. Later, he was the president of Microsoft Research and Google's Chinese branch.
Lee recognised the US Government's technology contests such as the US Department of Defence Research Office's Robotics Challenge (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge) and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the following dreamers.
“US researchers have to work hard to get funding from the government, ” said Lee.
“The Chinese are not the ones who take over the Harans, but they are companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Mr Lee said that the changes to immigration policy could help the US to support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think that people who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” said the man.
The NGA announced the NGA development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Research Fund and other government agencies allocate funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint artificial intelligence centre aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions.
This month, DARPA announced that she began to finance a $2 million initiative AI Next.
But the state research fund now finances over $100 million a year in technology-related research.
At the same time, the US legislation has not been amended, with the aim of establishing a National Committee on the National Intelligence of Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendums on changing the name of the state
The Macedonians voted in Sunday's referendum on whether to turn the country's name into the Republic of North Macedonia, a step which would also resolve a tens of long-term dispute with Greece, which has prevented the confirmation of applications for membership of Macedonia to the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour’s name constitutes a requirement for that territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments of two countries agreed on a new name for Macedonia, but opponents of nationalities claim that the name would damage the national identity of the Slavic peoples of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to take part in the referendum and that the campaign has caused doubts as to whether the voting activity will reach the level of 50% necessary for the referendum to apply.
The referendum asks: "Do you support the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU by agreeing with the agreement reached with Greece?"
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price paid by Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for Macedonia’s young people so that they can live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to change the name.
The National Election Commission said that there are no reports of irregularities at 1:00.
However, the election activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
Macedonia Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son, Dushko, gave his vote on 30 September 2018 on the amendment of the country's name, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small stage for those who did not vote.
“We want to be a part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join together, not through the servants’ door,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not wish to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get Europe-Asia into integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring more than 20 percent of the investment needed in Macedonia with unemployment rates.
“I believe that a large majority will support the change of name, as more than 80 % of citizens are in favour of EU membership and NATO,” said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said "yes-word" would be "a confirmation of our future".
The results of the poll published on Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43% of the voters were planning to take part in the referendum, which is below the necessary electoral activity.
The survey conducted by the Macedonia Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said you would answer "yes".
The success rate of the referendum is 50 per cent plus one vote.
Failure to vote would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policy after the government took over last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through Brighton defense in the name of the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling penetrated Brighton defense by ensuring Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero gave the impression that the gate he hit on his 65th game minutes became ridiculously easy.
The Argentine attacker passed through the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before he got to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He penetrated another defender before running past several players at the Brighton border of the penalty area.
Then he hit the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the right side of the network with the Mathew Ryan gater.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” said Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, reporters.
"We were talking about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit the gate at that time."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the original success of Premier League.
The gate was hit in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly on Brighton territory.
He sent the ball nicely to Leroy Sane, on the left side of the air.
Sane hit the ball a few times before he led Sterling further away.
Sky Blues kicked the ball out of the grid just before it slipped out of the borders.
Manchester City plays Masters League with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckari Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a happy guy against Rockies.
When the Nationals were excluded from the games of the final tournament, there was no reason to start again.
However, the competitive Scherzer hopes to make his country's Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockyis, who runs a game in NL West with one of the Los Angeles Dodgers, still has hope of getting to the finals.
Rockies guaranteed at least 5 to 2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure its first division status.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least try knowing that playing in Denver with this audience and the second team is probably higher than any other game I can expect this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight here?"
The nations have not yet called the Sunday opening player, but they are allegedly inclined towards Scherzer's feed in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it's 34th feeding, did a warm-up session on Thursday and fed it normally on Sunday.
This Washington-right-hand player is led by 18-7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of outlets 300 and the favourable possibilities of their 220 2/3 this season.
Trump's got a Western Virginia cheering call.
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the electoral activity of the Republic in arbitration.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
It's a big event I'm not running for, but I'm actually running for, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You will see this terrible, extremely terrible extreme group of Democrats, and you will see this happening in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're gonna have to drive over for power and control, the only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we're not giving them it."
The Democrats are, in his opinion, on a mission aimed at “to resist and prevent”.
"And you have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "creating, noble, humble, and false."
He referred, by name, to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, who was loudly called down among the audience.
"Do you see his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait – it was one of the worst body language examples, in fact the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leiborist Party is no longer a big connection.
This is unacceptable for those who express their opinion
When the activists of my local party Momentum voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last person to be told that you are not welcome, and this is all for the publication of your opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because he was strongly anti-Jewish.
As far as I'm concerned, the critics condemned me for not consulting Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are in a somewhat similar way to those on which Jeremy was also in disagreement with previous leaders.
Nottingham, a party in East, said: “We would like meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, the experience of my eight-year local Labourist Member with the meetings of the General Assembly of Friday evenings is exactly this.
Unfortunately, today, this is no longer true for most meetings, and the promise to be “lighter and more generous” in politics has long since been forgotten when it was ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the different aspects are not acceptable in the Leiborist Party, and for each opinion it is assessed who is acceptable to the board of the Party.
This started just after Jeremy became leader, and the co-worker I thought about sharing similar political views with him now waited for me to change my mind and take the positions I would never have accepted, regardless of whether it was national security or EU single market issues.
Whenever I stand up publicly somewhere, regardless of what I'm actually saying, it is followed by a judgment in social media, encouraging my resignation, ignoring party politics and saying that I should not be part of the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have more luck than some of my fellow workers, because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and determination of those fellow workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a great community and that any "reliability" initiative or amendment of electoral rules will make the party more narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years to keep my head down, talk less, and "it'll be okay here."
But it wasn't what I came to do in politics.
From the moment I joined the Leiborist Party 32 years ago, motivated by the care of the Thatcher Government, which had left my high school classroom literally on the edge of collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who need it most, acting as a member of the local council and as minister of the government.
I have never hid my policy, including in recent elections.
There is no way that someone in Nottingham East was confused with my political views or with my local leadership in the areas of non-consultation.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which harms households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the head of the Leiborist party.
But in fact, not the only message I have, meant for Nottingham's Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Leiborist Party or not: I am proud that I will serve you, and I promise that not one threat of retreat or political consideration will stop me from doing what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr moves to the top
Two of the late events may have been somewhat biased, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully fun Tennent's first league game.
They're now the only unbeatable team in the top ten of the table.
After all, it was a team of high-level protection and better risk taking that way for the crew to win and coach Peter Murchiel is fully entitled to be satisfied.
“We have been put into games all the time trying and we are still undefeated, so, of course, I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said: “Pean Ayris story, they used their chances better than ours.”
Grant Anderson's 14th play minutes, which was taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri the way forward, but to the captain of the Scottishs, Rory Hughes, who gave up the game at Warriors, the yellow card gave Melros a chance where Jason Baggot took a failed test.
Climo increased Ayri's successes with a penalty strike just before the end of the half-time, reaching a single auction at the end of the half-life in favour of 17-5 Ayri.
But Melrose began his second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's trial, taken over Baggoto, reduced the difference by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of the Ruardh Knott, after which the man was removed on the carrier frame. As the game continued, Ayr eduland increased further thanks to the Stafford McDowall test, which was transmitted by Climo.
Ayri's active captain Blair Macpherson was then with a yellow card, but again Melrose's player paid for Bruce Colvine's attempt to pass after a strong pressure.
However, the team on the way home gathered again strength, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball of punishment on the line, MacPherson put the ball behind the Ayrids who were going down.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's saucer and sent sideguard Gregor Henry to go home to play the team on the fifth test.
Still Game Star wants to begin a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems ready to enter the field of hosting services after it was discovered that the man was appointed director of a recognized restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a known BBC TV series, which he writes and shows with a long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
A couple have announced that the ninth season ahead will be the last of the series and it seems that Kiernan will make life after Craiglang's new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but Scottish Sun’s source suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the “sucking restaurant business” of Glasgow.
“We’re ours”: Without the sea border Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way for them to the Pacific Ocean again
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags lie above the offices of the Office.
For marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the reference is: “Our right is ours.
It is our duty to restore it."
In Bolivia, with no sea borders, there is a memory of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, still alive.
These expectations are sometimes the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and the country naturally expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The Hulk Bolivian people across the country look at the decision of the international court from large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia after decades of bitter discussions to give the last independent way to the sea.
The charismatic Hungarian President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial fight for re-election next year, is much at stake in the Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court is unlikely to vote in favour of Bolivia, or, if so, it would become very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands has no power to give up Chile's territory and has provided that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court is only taken six months after hearing the final statements indicates that it was not a ‘ruly case’, said the expert on international law in Chile, Paz Zárate.
And away from the additional causes of Bolivia, the last four years may have weakened the situation.
“The problem of access to merele has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities,” said Zárate.
Morales' warrior beauty speech has lost all the remaining Chilen charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not exchanged their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia's Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unnecessaryly urgent.
On Monday, Bolivia will give “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the possibility of “remaining the gaps of 139 years with mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known presidents in Latin America, is using the question of the sea to express political passion.
"Bolivia never gave up her right to access the Pacific," she added.
"There is a chance to see that we have to get over the past."
North Korea said that nuclear weapons will not be released until the country can not trust the United States of America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by the competitors during the Singapore Summit.
He commented at the time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seemed to be starting again as a nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, it is air leases that the U.S. continues to be restrictive and a refusal to terminate the war with Korea will put North Korea down.
Washington is cautious about such a statement when Pyongyang does not take first important steps towards armamenting.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon the weaponry that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree another Kim and Trump summit.
Paris fashions bring a series of massive covers to the viewers, which are brought to buyers in their neighborhoods.
If you want to increase your cybarac collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you will no longer have to look for it.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of weird headgears to the stage during their summer season 2019 that blinded Paris' fashion week.
High and impractical hats will be in fashion via Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their foot-to-mouthed works to those in the way they do.
Valentino's top work was a superimposed beige hat covering the heads of models, which had been decorated with a similar wide edge.
Other extremely large garments included jewels, magic hats, and even pineapples, but their purpose is not to heat.
Thom Brown also showed us the choice of strange masks, doing it exactly at the right time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had crushed their mouths, so they reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than of the high standard.
One part of the creation reminded of the dive suit, along with the air pipe and glasses, while the other reminded of the melted ice cream plant.
And if you're going to carry on with the giant moss, you're lucky.
Moegurus predict that super-sized headgears can reach the roadways near you.
The super-sized hats are coming right after La Bomba, a shoulder hat with a width of 60 centimetres, which has been seen on the head of all the celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cult brand that created a highly impractical hat in the social media sent another big work to the public — a beach bag of straws, almost as large as the model of bikinis that carry it.
The dark orange raffiado, which has a rapper with Narmas and a white leather cover, was the top work of the summer collection of Jacquemus La Riviera 2019 in Paris on the fashion week.
Luke Armitage of the sounds told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags in the next summer. Since the designer has had such a big influence, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extremely large items of clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The private schools in Scotland have remained at the top of the academic excellence table and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exams, which will strengthen personal and shared success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where more than 30 000 students learn more than the whole of Scotland, are represented by the Scottish private school council (SCIS), are seeking to offer their students and their parents the best service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a learning programme adapted to circumstances, we see that modern languages are still known in schools and desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak to a person in a language that is understood to him, it reaches his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will reach his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's fresh exam results show that the front of the tables are languages with the highest levels of examination among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages had a high score of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students were awarded the Mandarin grade A, the same price was obtained from German students 72 percent, French learners 69 percent and Spanish students 63 percent.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as vital skills for life, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages that are now among the choice of subjects are in the curriculum of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The study carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, among the reasons why it is difficult for employers to find workers for job vacancies, 17% of respondents were deprived of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future jobs.
To the extent that more desirable job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in the world of globalisation.
Regardless of the career choice made, the acquisition of another language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens is immediately a competitive advantage for a multilingual person.
According to a survey conducted in more than 4000 UK adults, 75 percent of respondents speak no foreign language well enough to hold this conversation. The only language with a double-digit percentage of participants was French by 15 percent.
The funding of language learning for children today is therefore important.
Multilingual languages, especially those with an emerging economy, provide children with better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at every school.
The Hulk school is more focused on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the United Kingdom in the light of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their fields of expertise.
The private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future will bring them.
It is no longer possible to deny that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, which is why they must also reflect education.
It is just modern languages that should really be viewed as "international communication skills".
Private schools continue to offer young Scots choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday at San Diego
I don't have to expect any more of the eager respectrs to see LeBron James do his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Luke Walton reported James playing the Denver Nuggets against San Diego at the opening game before Sunday season.
But the number of his playmates still needs to be determined.
“It’s over one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell's conviction that James is likely to play the read number of minutes.
After last week's training, James was asked about his plans regarding the six-game pre-season schedule of Lakers.
“I don’t need my career at this stage of the pre-season games to warm myself up,” he said.
Trumpi Western Virginia election campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch his election campaign series tonight in Wheelingus West Virginia.
It is a campaign event designed for Trump's first week of the next five, including suspensions in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the vote of confirmation stands until Trump elects who will be appointed to the Supreme Court's seat, he will try to increase his support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatening the abolition of control in Congress following the November vote.
What time is Trump taking place tonight at the campaign event in West Virginia and how to watch it on the Internet?
The Trumpi campaign event in Wheelingus West Virginia is taking place on Saturday evening 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m. on the eastern coast.
The Trump Western Virginia campaign event can be viewed on the Internet through YouTube flow transfer.
Trump is likely to speak to the candidate for Supreme Court about the meetings of Brett Kavanaugh this week, which became tense about the charges of sexual abuse, while the Senate's confirmation is suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the case.
However, the main aim of the series of campaign events is to help the Republicans face difficult elections in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign manager said that their next five weeks' event aims to “examine volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Governors,” said Reuters.
"The control of the Congo is so important for the President's agenda that Trump is heading for the election campaign season as soon as possible to a large number of states," told Reuters, a campaign press representative who did not want to mention his name.
This evening's campaign event, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheelingus, can be attended by supporters of “Ohios and Pennsylvania, and can also be reflected in the Pittsburgh media,” reported West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday is another time when Trump visits Western Virginia over the past month. It is a state where he received more than 40 percent of the voters' votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Republic of West Virginia senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is conducting polls on the basis of the charts.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has come to encourage his results,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, reported Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the nerve to compete, keeping hopes ahead of Sunday alone games high
After three unilateral sessions, the games held on Saturday afternoon were sometimes just what Ryder Cup needed.
A constant turning point pen is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players believe it really, especially in competitions like this one here.
So, where do they think it would be a turning point right now?
“They led by six points, which have now become four, so I think I can consider this to be a small turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, because four points are being led and there are 12 other points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they do not have enough wind in the sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points in four.
Spieth has been a jalust for both tii and grin and an example.
These sacraments became more and more loud with each circle, concealing a designated wooden that would have led to the fourth match after he and Thomas were on the ground with two.
His bag, which won the match on 15th, sent a similar call that showed a man's faith that the Americans are not out of the competition yet.
"You just have to play more focus and worry about your match," said Spieth.
It's the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have the undisputed stars of Ryder Cup on Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but loved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the bugy on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into the loud crowd, as it goes back, strengthens the opinion that players, with whom they will compete on Sunday, and that if the sun sets over Le Golf National, there is no possible European victory to confirm the most famous player as Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both to different holes.
However, it is premature to say so about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia with four-ball hero this morning, a quick job when a man was put in a couple with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine dug such a deep hole between the Spaniard and the Swedes that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out in August.
Four-balls and two-games are extremely attractive to look close to each other’s communication, advice to each other, missed advice and how the way things can change in the moment.
Europe has been playing better as a team and has been leading a strong lead for the last day, but this four-way session has shown that the U.S. team shares the nerve with some Americans, especially the Americans, to fight.
Europe is the leader of Ryder Cup on the last day 10-6
Europe is getting a good success on the last day of Ryder Cup, starting with Saturdays after four-balls and double games in front of the United States 10-6.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinar led two winnings in front of the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed two years ago to maintaining the chandelier lost in Hazeltine, reigned after the failure of the American side in the morning of the four-ball, winning a series of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the double game, winning two games, but they could not replace the deficit.
Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games of Sunday to preserve the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who, after this weekend, is called Molliwood, they are the second couple who have won four points in their fourth opening game in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they continued in the same spirit by subjugating Woods and the American beginner, Bryson Dechambeauvee, with a certainty: 5-4.
Woods, who drags himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shine, but now he's lost 29 of his four-balls and a pair game of 19 getting seven losses on a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested for four-balls in the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson, winning a 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is in the world order in the first and third positions.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was considered pleasant and windy in the weather south of Paris.
The three-time great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points as a reference point for the Americans on Saturday.
They won 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter in four-ball, returning later and winning two openings in the double game Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history has the team returned from a four-point deficit, going to single games, although as owner Furyk needs only five to preserve the cup.
Although being in second place for two days, it seems after the Sunday counter attack that they will not succeed.
North Korea says, "no way", they're not arming themselves on a unilateral basis because of lack of trust.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continuing restrictions on their mistrust against the United States and that the country did not intend to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that during the last year, North Korea has taken "markable charity measures", such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the destruction of the nuclear testing site and the promise of nuclear weapons and not to spread nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the United States answering it, ” he said.
"Without confidence in the US, our country lacks security security and, in such circumstances, we do not agree to make ourselves unilateral first weapon-in-arms."
Although Ri reiterated the familiar complaints of North Korea regarding the Washington resistance to the "strip" approach to the nuclear non-nuclearisation, which would be awarded to North Korea when it took gradual steps, his statement considered it important that he did not reject the unilateral nuclear ceasefire, as it has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between the President of the United States of America on 12 June and the North Korean leader in Singapore, where Kim agreed to move towards the “rejection of the DPRK” and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has requested the official closure of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
"USA calls for "prevention of nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure of restrictions to achieve their objective coercively, even against the declaration of war's end," Ri said.
“I find that our limitations on our knees are a dream for people who do not know us at all.
However, the problem is that our distrust will be deepened by the continuing limitations."
Ri did not mention the plans of Kim and Trump's second summit, which was emphasised earlier by the United States leader this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If South Korea, not the United States, would not have reached such a deadlock on the subject of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula."
However, Ri's speech was sharply different from that of last year when he told the UN General Assembly that turning North Korea's missiles to the US continent was inevitable after Trump called Kim's suicide mission "a rocket man".
Last year, last year, Trump, threatened to completely destroy North Korea, from the United Nations to Kim, for his courage to take steps towards being armed, but added that there is still much to be done and that restrictions must remain in force until North Korea is abandoned from nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump said that he did not have a timetable for this, saying: “Is it going to take two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward the measures taken by Pjongjangjang.
At the same time, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's restrictions must continue to be strong and unpunished until we can fully and permanently confirm the waiver of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea, trying to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Riga next to the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After his meeting with Piongyang Juulika, he said that progress had been made since he was condemned by North Korea for "gangsterlike demands" in just a few hours.
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to demolish missiles and nuclear complexes if the United States were to implement “corresponding measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that under "consistency measures" he meant security guarantees at Trump Singapore and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to rest enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight for a growing aggressive culture where they are studying in caffeine-rich night-to-night learning Marathons.
Students who love academics at the world’s best university are often helpless when dealing with the basics of self-care.
In the opinion of Professor Charles Czeisler, a dream doctor at Harvard Medical School and professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, this is the first one in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of the course after he spoke about how sleep disorders affect learning.
"At the end of this, a girl came to me and asked, "Why is it just now, in my last year of school?"
He said that no one's ever told him the importance of a dream - it created me to be a bear," he explained to Telegraph.
The course that came in this year's curriculum will explain to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting results and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health at the University, said that the university decided to take the course program after it was found that students were in serious sleep failure during the week of work.
The hourly course includes a number of interaction tasks.
In one section, a picture of a common flat is presented. There students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports footwear and books and explain the effects of caffeine and light on how sleeplessness affects sports results and the importance of sleeping practices.
The second section explains how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the University City with contrasting symbols encourages participants to think about their daily practice.
“We know that this does not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, modern techniques and increasing pressure for students are still proud of the night’s learning marathons, adding that sleeplessness is still a growing problem.
"The guarantee of sufficient quality sleep should be a student's "salary arm" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety," he added. "This helps even to fight weight gain, because sleeplessness puts the brain in a hunger regime, making a person hungry constantly."
19 years of chemical and physical biology student Raymond So, from California, helped Professor Czeisler to create a course, having participated in one of his classes in the previous Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to a university-wide course.
In the next step, he wants all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up alarm clocks for both sleep and wake-up, and be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lighting on "blue light", as this could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga gate defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bad guest game in the hands of the Dolly Menga hit by Steven Gerrard, bringing 1-0 victory to Livingston.
Ibrox side hoped to win his first guest victory from February when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a leader, remaining eight points behind the leader of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga created his gate seven minutes before the halftime, and the poor preparedness of the Rangers couldn't recover from it.
The Rangers therefore fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place, remaining on Hibernian with only one gate.
For the Rangers, problems may not be over yet, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound treatment after he was probably hit by an object that was probably being robbed.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that passed Ayris and Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, however, went on to the same Liv 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been much more dominant than the village, but Livingston did much more than that with his ball.
They should've hit the gate in the second opening, when the first exchange with Men sent Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor Gate, but the half guard didn't take advantage of his opportunity.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs release was then found Captain Craig Halketti, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-scale hit in the back of the post.
The Rangers did get control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he bumped into Steven Lawless at the 15th playback, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy Columbiaian player's complaint.
In the first half of the Rangers managed to target only two shots, but the former Ibrox Gater Liam Kelly was not concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's headline or the Ovie Ejaria event.
Although Liv's opening for 34 minutes may have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Again, the Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deeply heavy performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson, who maintained peace and selected Menga, who just took the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted during the break-in, changing against Coulibaly Ryan Kent, and that exchange almost paid off when the periphery split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly smuggled her place.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt side could have promoted its leadership at the end of the day, but McGregor stood firm to stop Jacobs before he hit Lithgow at a big corner.
The Rangers substitute, Glenn Middleton, once again applied for punishment when he and Jacobs went up, which Thomson again failed.
Almanahh: Geiger counter inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and LOTENDE... the day when German future physicist Johannes Wilhelm was born “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity. It was an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science, Geiger also became the foundation of populist culture, as in the 1950 film "Coronado watches", where in the main sections they were apparently unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that all about?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these headphones are carried, it is possible to hear a pod of atoms released from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, it's not going to work!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system "seeing" pettur cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" pettur cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches you the immune system as part of the treatment of traitor cells
The method involves the taking of immune cells from the patient and the modification of these cells in the laboratory.
Then, for many cancers, they can have a common protein and they will be injected back.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine to teach the immune system to the detection of pettur cells lost her ovarian cancer by more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory to obtain a ‘skin’ protein that is common in the case of different HER2 cancers and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Maryland explained: “Our results indicate that we have a highly promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads the growth of many cancer types”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia in patients who are taking immune cells and are instructed to target cancer cells.
Kanye West started with Trump's supporting tribe, bearing a MAGA hat in the direct transmission of SNL.
It didn't go very well.
You can receive Saturday Night Live in the studio at the home of the homicidal wool in the direction of Kanye West, after his mixed speech, in which he congratulated President Donald Trump of the United States and announced his application for the same post in 2020.
After that night in his third song, which was named Ghost Town, and where he was wearing a hat letter from Make America Great, he began to play the same against the Democrats and repeat his support for Trump.
“I’ve spoken to so many white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, is he race? ’
“If I was so worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, ” she said.
SNL started a device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's fame made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Committee of Judges regarding the alleged sexual violence against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this part of the show didn't go into the air, West's break-in cabinets were loaded into Chris Rock's social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to blink with West's mail.
West also complained to the audience that he had a pretty difficult time behind the scenes about his hat.
"They made fun of me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go there, hat in the head.
They made fun of me!
And then they say that I've drowned in the place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the drowned place? I put my Superman’s toilet on my back, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments were triggered at least two times by the audience and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person said: “All the studio became mortal.”
West was introduced to the last minute to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, was dead a few days earlier.
West amazed many of the songs “I Love It”, which at the time of his presentation he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, leader of a conservative group of TPUSA, who stated: “To one of the brave souls: TO BE RECOVERED BY THE JULGES FOR RIHVAMS.”
But accompanying director Karen Hunter's spark that West was just “the one who he is, and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I decided to reward MITTE (purchase my music or clothing or supporting her “arts”) someone who, in my opinion, believes and distributes a harmful world view to my community.
He's free.
As did we," he added.
Before the show, a rapper reported on Twitter that he'd changed his name by saying that he's now "old Kanye West."
He's not the first singer to change his performer's name, following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dog has also been named Snoop Lion and, of course, a recent music legend Prince who turned his name into a symbol.

The glory of the Thrones game Kit Harington does not approve of the highly masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword's flashing role in the violent medieval fantasy series of Thrones game by Jon Snowina HBO.
But an actor (31) puts down an aggressive hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “anything has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve a highly masculine problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31), admitted that she felt "very strongly" that this problem needs attention.
“I feel very strongly at present that we have gone wrong with manhood somewhere, ” he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that partly television is responsible for the increase in masculinity, as it shows extreme performances.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they must be just like those they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the bigger questions of our time - how to change it?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for young men."
He also admitted that, after the end of the series, he would never participate in any of the Throne Games in line, saying that he was “one of his battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard is part of the revitalization of True West, a story about the film maker and his kidnapper brother.
An actor recently announced that he considered meeting with his wife Rose the best thing about the Thrones game.
"I was in this series with my wife, so it gave me my future family and my future life," she said.
Rose played with Emmy the award-winning fantasy show at Ygritte, Kit's playbook Jon Snow.
In June 2018, a couple married Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reporting 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
About 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been caused by sex, changing the past.
The spread of HIV in some parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had fallen to almost zero, the Chinese health officials confirmed at the conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was regulated in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly high.
Research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married to women.
Many transmissions of disease relate to insufficient sexual protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has allowed general access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaking of GOP senator data by saying that it is "dangerous lies" and "consistency theory"
On Saturday, the US representative, Maxine Waters, condemned the allegations that his employee had posted personal data from three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by "ultra-right" trolls and their websites.
"Women, lies, and more despicable lies," said Waters in his Twitter application.
The information reported included home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utahs).
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday. It had been posted by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill at the time of hearing the Senate Panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Judges of the Supreme Court against Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked just after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
The old-fashioned websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the post, was connected to the Waters office and issued membership information by a member of Waters, reported Hill.
“This unjustified statement is a complete and absolute lie,” continued Waters.
“My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety are threatened by these fraudulent and false claims, are in no way liable for this information form.
This unjustified statement is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly reviewed on the Internet, including one of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial comes from anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that he has a kind of feeling that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not become angry.
They can't be troubling.
They must not question the motives of the accused.
They must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of being too angry when he was listening to Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running over Waters during the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"When it comes to the truth," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant office and law enforcement authorities about their petitions.”
"We all do to find out the criminals," he continued, "and to make them legally responsible for all their actions that are destroyed and dangerous to all my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again Overview - Sub-arranged Rowan Atkinson Spion Party
It is now common to look for Brexit’s meaning in all new British films, and it seems particularly appropriate for Johnny English’s rumid parodiaeraria, which began with Johnny English in 2003, and was restored to Johnny English in 2011.
Are humorous jokes about yourself when we are obviously stupid in the new export possibilities of the country?
In any case, incompetence with a twilight rubber, Johnny English has once again obtained permission to do things in his dwarve way - and that broad comical creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it is a secret agent who, despite his strange demonstrational smuggler-glamur, resembles little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a little character who gave to the Chariots of Fire in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on a traveler and international mystery Atkinson, once played in forgotten Barclaycard TV advertising, who is leaving only chaos behind.
There are only one or two pleasant moments in this recent JE film.
I liked the approach to Johnny English helicopter when he was wearing a medieval cuff and the helicopter's winged him against the helmet for a second.
The Atkinson gift is shown to make a physical comedy, but the humor appears to be less important and strangely superfluous, especially when “real” spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer self-sufficient comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than for adults, and for me Johnny English's clever adventures are not as resourceful and concentrated as Atkinson's dark movies as Beanina.
Today, there is forever an actual assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber-cracker has penetrated the British network of highly secret spies, revealing the personalities of all British secret police officers, thereby making a great disappointment to an on-site agent - with unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a party and in distress, who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this great work on Teresa-May, but the manuscript does not have much to do about it.
His intelligence advisors recommend that, since all active spies are threatened, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a school teacher in a proud institution, giving secret lessons about how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers a school of Rock spy school.
English is flying back to Whitehall for emergency information and is reunited with its former long-term partner Bough, who is again playing Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talent of actress Vicki Pepperdine has been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service is about to act again, meeting Olga Kurolenko's encased, beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullettova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister dangerously falls under the hands of a charismatic tech billionaire.
English and Bough begin with their sensual odyssey: by hiding themselves as rapporteurs, they set fire to the French restaurant; they create chaos, falling on the board of Volta's luxury yacht; and English launches a real mess when trying to use the virtual reality set to meet the interior of Volta's house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as sweet and stormy as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV mask on it.
It's pretty medieval stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I was thinking: does the British film industry really have no place to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would be fair to his talent?
The working party denies drawing up a plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a turning plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
The parties would like the company's executives to pass on the savings received through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers by giving them an additional day off.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but they'll get the same salary.
According to the Alliance, this idea would fit in with the party's economic agenda, and this is how the country is going to tilt for the benefit of the workers.
The Thursday's week of work has been approved at the Trade Union Congress so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
The source of the work party told The Sunday Times: “It is said that the revision of the draft will be announced before the end of the year.
"This is not overnight, but Thursday's working week is an effort that is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy, both in the interests of workers and with the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The working party is not the first to support such ideas, because during its 2017 election campaign, Green Party also promised Thursday working week.
At present, however, the Labour Party does not support this effort as a whole.
Pressman of the Labour Party stated: “The four-day working week is not a party’s policy and it is not discussed.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to clarify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to take back power from the "perfect leaders" and "companies" of public utility companies.
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover all their participation, as the Labour Party could do "debt" with the perceived wrongdoing.
He confirmed his plan to put employees into company boards and to create equity funds to provide 10% of the equity of private sector companies instead of giving annual bonuses up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in "60 minutes" about whether an FBI study of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court for a period of at least one week and raises the question whether the Bureau's conclusions could affect the end of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday interview, you'll be receiving a 60 minutes escort from Scott Pelley's Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham to see if the FBI could reveal something that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Obviously," said Kennedy.
“I said I would go to the interrogation. I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after he got charged, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, firm and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems to be on the rocks.
“I am sure of my decision as to Brett Kavanaugh and can only be changed in a bomb Changer,” he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he mentioned could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the Global Citizen Festival of the Global Civil Society Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, an annual music event will be organised by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has a hugely impressive presence and the same impressive goal: to lose poverty from the world.
Now, the seventh time Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn, not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real goal of the event, namely ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which is a group of international lawyers who hope to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To obtain a free ticket for the event (if you do not wish to pay for the VIP ticket), the concerters had to perform a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to a world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if it has been another 12 years to reach their goal?
Does the idea of giving people a free concert is a real way of convincing them to act or is it just another click joke where people feel they're doing something important by signing a statement online or by making a spell?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “actions” for its supporters, trying to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than 37 billion dollars of commitments and policies that affect more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and the notification resulting from their activities and of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or financed.
The group appreciates that the guaranteed funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the partnership between investors and implementrs in the United Kingdom The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “encouraging all children’s capabilities” by allowing Rwanda to pay 35 million dollars to help the country stop malnutrition after having received more than 4700 smokes from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as you, we can transform malnutrition into an historic footnote in social injustice,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 activities in the UK called for improved nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding project The Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children in need of dietary intervention.
In response to a KKK on their website, which asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult road - sometimes falling and we fail.
However, as we face great civil rights and anti-partheid movements, we are sure of our success because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Momae is just a few performers who will take up this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use a Marine "intrusion" to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may use its Navy if necessary to prevent Russia's energy market being hit, including the Middle East, has been released by US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, particularly if it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for the investigation of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to exchange energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of southern Europe,” he said.
And the officer said there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States of America has this opportunity to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, prevented in order to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit company, which represents the US "energy consumer voice".
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, indicating that they were essentially the same.
“Iran and Russia’s economic choice is more or less, amplifying and replacing fuels,” he said, referring to Russia at the same time as the “one trick ponie” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is responsible for increasing the export of LNG to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials at Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, seek to discourage Germany from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, transformed Berlin to Moscow as a prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of USD 11 billion, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kreml claims that Washington's acute response to the project has simply been driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure publication tool and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, at a meeting in Moscow in September with US Minister for Energy Rick Perry.
The United States' attitude has come back from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Lead Industrial Organization, the German Industrial Union (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and Berlin and Moscow's bilateral agreements.
“I have a major problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Union (BDI) after the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren seriously weighs as president in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that during the interim elections he seriously considered the nomination as president.
In Holyoke Raekoja, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his application.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government and it also includes the first lady, ” said The Hill.
"From 6 November, I seriously consider running for President."
Warren also gave an assessment of President Donald Trump’s activities in the raehouse, saying that he ‘ will lead the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy, ” he said.
Warren has expressed criticism towards Trump and its High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren stated: "We naturally need the FBI before we vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think that he should apply in 2020.
According to the political research centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe polls, 58% of the "possibly" voters of Massachusetts thought that the senator should not be nominated.
32% supported this application.
The survey showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidate, 38% supported possible application and 48% opposed it.
The other high profile democratic names discussed in connection with the possible application for 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that she officially decided by January, informed the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump when gathering Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent a year recruiting from Iraq in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and was charged
“What my son lives through what he is experiencing when he comes back, I can associate myself with other families who know the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers will return to,” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s gathering in Tulsa, Oktham.
Palin called in his son's arrest “the living room” and said, in connection with his son and other war veterans, “they come back a little differently, they come back as carats, they come back to think of whether there has been enough respect for what soldiers and airmen and all other militarymen have given to the state.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasillas Alaska and Wasilla Police Department pressman Dan Bennett said that he was accused of domestic violence against women, domestic violence in an intervention report and of having a gun in a drunk state.
18 states and Columbia are challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge for a new US policy that prohibits victims of asylum from fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday at Washington, 18 national and regional representatives made a brief statement to support the applicant’s call for policies, according to NBC News.
The applicant's full name Grace v Sessions is not published in the Official Journal of the United States of America against Union policy in August.
She said that her fellow "and her violent sons of gang members" abuse her, but U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing a large number of US asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence as a major problem.
The new US asylum policy revolved the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeal of Migrants, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to submit asylum applications.
General Prosecutor Karl Racine of Columbia stated in Friday that the new policy "is not being implemented for decades by state, Union and international law".
"The Federal Law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that requirement violates this principle," said a brief statement of the judges.
In a brief statement, the lawyers also argued that banning immigrants' entry would harm the US economy by saying that they would likely start to be entrepreneurs and "offload the necessary labour".
In June, the High Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration courts to no longer give asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The application for asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or certain social groups or political opinions,” said Sessions in its communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day.
Emotional rescue operations Prayer where deaths have doubled in the fight against survival
The situation for the survivors was increasingly threatening.
"The situation is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever at the city evacuation center in the town of Palu, a little boy.
“In every minute, new people arrive with an ambulance.
There's not enough fresh water."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting things out and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals that had been damaged by 7.5-magnetic earthquakes were overburdened.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris in broken back and upper arms, were rested outside the Palu army hospital, where patients were continued to be treated on the outside because of severe postpartums.
The tears filled her eyes when she recalled the strong earthquake shaking her fifth floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“There was time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed in the ruins of the wall," said Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
The US Ambassador blames China for “the temptation to bully commercials”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four pages of advertising under daily U.S. daily reform regarding the mutual benefit of US-China trade, the US ambassador accused Beijing of using American press to promote propaganda.
President of the United States Donald Trump referred to the supplement paid by China Daily last Wednesday in Des Moines Register - the biggest tour of the country of Iowa - after the prosecution of China for the US Congress elections on 6 November in intervention against China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in US elections marked what US officials described to Reuters as the new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently growing in the war of trade, where import tariffs are adjusted among others.
Chinese countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to hit States such as Iowa's exporters, as they supported the parties to the Trump Republics, the Chinese and US experts have explained.
Ambassador of the United States in China and former governor of Iowa, as well as the largest exporter of agricultural products in China, Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his article of the Des Moines Register on Sunday: “China has now doubled its temptation by publishing a publication in our free press.”
“The Chinese Government, when it distributes its propaganda, uses the American expensive freedom of expression and free press practice, putting its paid advertising in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“However, there are only limited votes in Beijing's street competition and there is no real difference in opinion that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media is in the firm hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding Chinese newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that the Republicans are moving female voters before the interim elections with Kavanaugh's fiasco
While many Republicans await and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of many sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the forthcoming interim elections, especially women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go on voting.
These things cannot be taken back," said the professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse, Grant Reeher, on his Saturday, published an article to The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last minute of the FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arzona) was sufficient to reassure those who were angry.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said MoveOn’s Senior Adviser and National Representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC.
On Friday morning the protestors repeated their statement in the Senate corridor, because the Republicans, who control the judges' committees, decided to move forward with the candidateship of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, informed Mickey.
“Democratic indemocracy and internal tension are beginning to be excluded from the schedule,” said the informal political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"Man says it's already high, it's true.
But this may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not like and abstain from voting by the President."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a setback when the Republicans moved on with confirmation.
"It has become very confusing for GOP," said former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to Michael Steele NBC News.
“It does not only concern the vote of the Commission, the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh, it also concerns how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated him,” led the US (group that will help to choose the Democrats) to draw Guy Cecil’s attention to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, believing after the testimony of Ford and who was Kavanaugh, but a little more supporting the first.
YouGov's new survey showed that 41% of respondents believed surely or probably Ford's testimony, while 35% said they sure or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford confessed to the Senate's Committee of Judges last week by swornly that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed him his family life when they attended a party in Yale during the 1980s.
The World Wide Web explorer intends to launch a new Internet that would put the breast on Google and Facebook
The World Wide Web explorer Tim Berners-Lee launched a start-up company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The final project of the technology legend Inrupt is a company that builds Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and to which people have access to information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun of the fact that Inrupt's goal is "world rule".
"We have to do this now," he said about the starter company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their "personal online database" or POD.
It may include contact lists, list of tasks, calendars, collection of music and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and simultaneously.
This personal online database makes it unique that the user can choose who can access this information.
The company shall refer to it as “the granting of individual powers by means of data”.
According to John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company will bring sources, process and relevant skills to help Solid make available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of a Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project under contract, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week forward technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google, whether to introduce a complete change if all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
On Saturday’s Medium published post, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s aim is to offer commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an effective vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee World Wide Web consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will remain the founder and director.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next age of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Memorial of a clergyman who was baptized in World War I was opened
During World War I only, Victoria’s baptized Church of England celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home city.
Lieutenant General Bernard Vann fought his mark on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper bullet and didn't know he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons opened a monument in Rushden at Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "genically symbolic" if the stone were to open just 100 years after his grandfather's award.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his Battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentini on 29 September 1918 “by means of a very thick fog japs and a bullet burden for machine guns.”
Later, he hurried into the line of attack and carried it on with the greatest galance before he rushed himself to one of the shooters and three of the opponents turned out to be otter.
Colonel Vanni killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918 when the war had only been completed for a little more than a month.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's action was “anything I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a parade led by Brentwood's religious youth band.
Michael Vann said that he had “a great honour to take part in this parade” and added that“so many people’s presence and support show that the true hero is well valued.”
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 all night looking up, but only saw Peppa in Põrsa
Imagine you've been up all night to watch Bellator 206, but this main event is not shown to you.
The San Jose match contained 13 fights, including six main cards, and it was shown in the UK on 5th channel direct transfer throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald prepared to put their breasts in the chest, UK viewers had a bullet in their mouths because Põrsas Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not impressed, especially those who had remained awake until early hours to see this battle.
One fan described a Twitter switch to children's comics as "a joke that hurts so much".
“This is the government regulation that at 6:00, the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the children’s programme,” explained Dave Schwartz, Vice-President Bellatori on marketing and communication issues when the transfer was asked.
"Sweet Peppa, yes."
Bellatori President Scott Coker said that they intend to work towards drawing up their schedule in order to take more account of UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about the presentation now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. Sunday morning, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of text back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical alarm.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're showing a reference instead of six fights - as we usually do - to try to offer more fans, and we just went over time.
It's a strange situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt sexually "low-valued"
The Olympic winner, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling he was inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until he left high school that "one is not like him".
In participating in Lauren Laverne Radio 4, Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
Being a parent also changed his attitude towards winning the Olympics, giving him the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You will receive a normal long-term escort from Kirsty Young to take a few months off due to his illness.
In Laverne's first broadcast, Daley said that he felt less valuable when he grew up than others because it wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, gave me power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worthy of something, and he didn't let others down when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double-pronk Olympic winner has become the lead driver of the LGBT campaign, using his appearance at the Community Games of this year in Australia to turn to more countries for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he's lucky he can live openly without consequences and he wants to give hope to others too.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - “took him as a surprise.”
Daley married Oscar last year, who was 20 years older than he was, but he said that the difference between age was never a problem.
“If you live so much when you’re young,” he went to his first Olympic games at the age of 14 and his father died three years later - it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar rises and swords.
A couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all prospect" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold medal," he said.
“But, you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son got his name after his father Robert, who died when he was 40 years old in 2011.
Daley said that his father did not agree to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that "Father, you can't sit in the front row because by that time you're gone", he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not undefeated,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the pronex.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive in front of the home population at the Olympic Games, that there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 on Friday at 11:15 BST.
The form was removed from the game on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson makes record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to fix his form to avoid unfortunate verstapost.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years at the event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's partner and four-ball.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner divided his day into two, being an incentive and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hiter, even at the peak of his career, is a 48-year-old especially suitable to play in the narrow Le Golf National Golf Golf Course, where the long tough track is constantly punishing the lost punch.
And if the square itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, at his ninth race to face the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinar, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four competitions this week.
If the Americans, who are 12 at the beginning of the single game with four points, start a hot start, Mickelson's competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he didn't have much else to add.
“He fully understood his role today; he put his hand around my shoulder, and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
"He's very confident.
He's famous, and he's given so many of our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more, but that's how it went, and we had to choose this way.
He wants to be out like everybody else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most part of Ryder Cup games.
It can be celebrated at the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven strokes, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team a complementary spiritual contribution.
“He’s funny, ridiculed, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he’s just great in the team room,” he explained.
“I think younger players had a lot of fun going up against him this week, and it was nice to see it.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great country of progress could soon disappear.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup in the last day can easily turn into an unpleasant experience at the beginning of individual games.
At the 1997 competition in Valderram, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, five-point countries of progress were held before the Americans, but it had fallen dramatically in reaching the finish line, only the victory was obtained with the result 141⁄2 : 131⁄2.
“You even realize that we had a great leadership position in Valderram; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and Valderram, where we won, this victory came very little,” said Bjorn in the picture after Class of 2018 winning 5 : 3 Friday and yesterday with success 10 : 6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have points in it.
We have a goal that is to win the cup, and so let's focus on it.
I've always said, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world."
Having been satisfied with the fact that his players have played in this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I will not get involved in things.
Tomorrow we will be dealing with new obstacles.
Tomorrow, personal favors are being read, and so this is something else.
It's nice to be with a opponent when things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be tested as a golf player.
That's the message you have to send to the players - give yourself the best of you tomorrow.
"Now that you leave your partner behind, you have to go and do it yourself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to act in person better than with the opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both of them in these last days, being part of the team of Brookline's victory before being part of the defeat when Europe defeated the 'Medinah miracle'.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all their games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start with a fire like Brookline and like Medinahi.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the average competitions.
We set up our crew according to this and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel like it's gonna be a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas's task is to try the race and he is the best match with Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in that order because I think that’s how we’re covered,” said Bjorn of the choice of my single game.
Germany's new warship has been slowed down again
The German Navy's latest high-speed sail should have been in place in 2014, replacing the obsolete Cold War-time warships, but this will not happen until the next year due to the malfunctioning systems and the increased costs of snowballs, the local media reported.
The introduction of the new ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalzi’ in the Baden-Wuertemberg class has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying post-transfer problems did not make it easy to obtain this ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 replace the old-fashioned Bremen class with fast sailboats.
It is understood that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some concealment technologies such as radar, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important opportunities include longer periods of care - the latest quick-tracks should be able to be sent out from home for up to two years.
Long delays, however, mean that high-level warships, which allow German powers to be strengthened abroad, are already getting older when they enter the service.
The failed F125 high-speed sail showed up last year when the German Navy officially refused to take up the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Vossi shipyard.
It was the first time that the Navy has returned the ship after it was received to the shipbuilder.
There was little to know about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of important “software and hardware deficiencies” that made the warship inoperable if they had been used on the battle mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are operated by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the older Bremen class's fast sail crew.
It also found that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Navy to include future innovations.
The 7,000 tonnes “Rheinland-Pfalz” is probably twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the team, becomes a problem.
It has been said that it amounts to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest high-speed fleets will become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's Navy capacity will fall.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Committee on Defence, admitted that the Marines had actually ended "the ships eligible for departure".
The official said that this theme has grown as a snowball over time because old ships were removed, but the replacement ships did not come.
He regretted that none of Baden-Wuerttember's fast sailboats could join the Navy.
National Trust examines the secret life of bats
The purpose of the new study on Scotland’s mountainous land is to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light to their unique flying mammals’ behaviour and help guide future protective measures.
A study of the National Trustists in Scotland monitors the usual and soprano wings in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, as well as the brown long-haired and Daubenton bats.
Special recordings are placed in the main areas of the area to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting field studies using handholding sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency and species of skin mice.
Then a map and report of habitats will be created to create a detailed landscape view of their behaviour.
The NTS conservation advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for leather mice and other associated species.
In Scotland and the UK as a whole, the mortality rate of bats has fallen significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their place of life and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and chemical treatment of some construction materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Skin mice aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful to catch prey than their eyes.
They use complex echo-dwelling techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
More than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares NTS responsible for maintenance of land are taking skin mice very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, surveys, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even created the first and the only special bat reserve in the Thrareve area of Scotland in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight categories of bats live in Scotland.
Real estate manager David Thompson says this area is an ideal territory for them.
"We have a large area for bats in Thrave," he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there's still a lot more to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us to understand what they need."
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before the start of maintenance activities on real estate, as the undesirable destruction of one place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Skin mice are protected and the killing, harassment or destruction of them is illegal.
Mr Ferrell, Officer of the Scottish Defence League, has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their mortals feed.”
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape while lawyers plan to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the rape charges against him as a “created” saying that people are“ willing to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the accused German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape by Americanman Kathryn Mayorga at the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
He has claimed to have paid the woman EUR 330 643,10 to ensure that the incident was not mentioned, Mr Spiegel announced on Friday.
By returning to Instagram's direct video of 142 million followers after an hour of prosecution, Ronaldo (33) announced that this was a "debt reform".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's talk is in the false mood," said the five times Ballon d'Or winner of the news.
They want to promote themselves with my name.
It's common.
They want my name to be famous, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and I'm fine," added a player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the court regarding the ‘unauthorised suspicion of privacy’.
Advokat Christian Schertz said that the player claims compensation “for the damage caused by moral damage, which corresponds to the difficulty of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After the night club, Ronaldo and Mayor were supposed to go back to the player’s hotel room, where they allegedly were raped according to the documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99 percent good man", of whom "one percent is wrong".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual intercourses, but it wasn't unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photos of injuries in the hospital, but later he agreed with an extrajudicial solution because he was afraid of “the payment” and was concerned about “public humiliation”.
Now, 34-year-old women say that they are now trying to reverse the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumatize them.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid and, this summer, he moved to Italy with a huge deal of EUR 100 million in Juve.
Brexit: The UK can start to regret the departure of car manufacturers forever.
The United Kingdom "for ever and ever", if he lost his position as head of the world car industry after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that the Tokyo UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop their production at a factory close to Derby in Burnaston.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of crossing stops without Brex's agreement can pay for jobs.
In the Burnaston plant, where cars are manufactured in the Tokyo Auri and Avens, nearly 150 000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain is to leave the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop to the production process in its factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston's Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared that they would leave the EU without an agreement, with concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says he's closing down the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of the Brexit Agreement.
Toyota production line works as necessary where spare parts arrive from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, may cause delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more than one day’s stock at her Derbyshire factory, which means that production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan in relation to the future EU relations is “specifyly calibrated to avoid such controls at the border.”
"We are looking for an agreement: we want the best solution that will enable what we want, and not just to use the success of today, but to take advantage of the opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 on Today.
"The evidence, not only about Mr Toby, but also about other producers, shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production was stopped, but in the long term he warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually also pay for jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members are more and more concerned: “We know that if jobs are lost, they will not return.
The government pressman said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed by another week, as the fight against the highest candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, announced on Sunday.
Mr Rosenstein will monitor the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who will investigate the intervention of the Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the prevention of possible justice by the President.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General and thus endangers Mueller's independence, Washington has been making rumors for several months now.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of eavesdropping tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing President 25 through amendment.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, reporting he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate's jury of judges, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave lessons.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate's vote.
Trump's spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at the news channel Fox News.
When he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press informed, as always."
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders had not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
The messenger, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information lessons was not due to the disillusionment of TV journalists, although he added: “I do not object to the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president will do more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
The hours of information continue, assured Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States straight questions, then it’s much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this a lot, and you've seen how we've been doing this over the last few weeks, so it's happening during a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo's press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president, perhaps, demonstrated why, being gathered up before journalists took off on a free trip and sometimes with a strange look.
Health minister wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland NHS to express their gratitude and wish to be present after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months have passed since the UK exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of a well-established status for EU citizens working in their public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations have continued on the return between the United Kingdom and the EU, heading towards the expected decisions in autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each worker, regardless of his nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service work and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed after the main trauma of emergency surgery
Tennessee State Tigers' support player Christion Abercrombie went through an extraordinary surgery after Saturday's head injury and defeat from 31 : 27 Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury happened just before the half-life.
"He fell on his side and just collapsed," said Reed.
Teachers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen while they were on the side before they were placed on the carrier frame for further inspection from the field.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harrise (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details of the type/satellite of the injury yet, and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
The second year of the red shirt student Abercrombie was in Tennessee State during his first season after his transition from Illinois.
On Saturday, before he left the game, he had five battles that made a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign purchasers must pay higher temple fees when purchasing real estate in Great Britain
External purchasers must pay higher temple fees than they buy real estate in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist homeless people on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will undermine Corby's ambition to attract young voters
Customs duties shall be levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to GBP 120 million per year to assist homeless people.
Foreign buyers must pay higher rates of stamp duty than they buy real estate in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The move is considered to be an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corby’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to offer them affordable living space and to target people with high incomes.
The Templar is taxed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, placing additional money on the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to this temple tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for purchases related to the other home and trend - can be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to GBP 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's immovable property is purchased to non-UK residents, which raise prices and make it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down when purchasing housing.
Many of the wealthy regions of the country - especially the capital - have become 'dwelling cities' thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices when they bought land but did not use it, and Mayd called off affordable home quotas to improve the British "life-related shame".
Corbyn has announced the reform of a smuggled residential economy, including rent control and the termination of the repression of innocent people.
It also wishes to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “This year I promised, as Prime Minister, that I would commit myself to restoring British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
It is, however, right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies abroad, can buy homes as hard work for British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away and the harsh conditions of sleeping are a normal reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is the management of Scotland"
Sunderlan's leader Jack Ross says that his ultimate goal is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge of revitalizing the North-Eesti club that is currently in League One's third place, with only 3 points behind it.
He moved to the stadium this summer after he had taken St Mirren back to Scotland's Masters League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B, and this thing was limited," said Ross BBC Scotland, Sport Sound.
“But I grew up with my father, watching Scotland in Hampden, and it’s always something that has drawn me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I'm successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland have been Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear of such large and well-known names, having previously endured both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, success is at the moment I can take this club to the League of Masters."
Because of its structure and facilities, it belongs to the League of Masters," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get here, but I can only see myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only worked as a leader for three years, before being one of Dumbarton's assistant generals and 15 months of leading Hearts staff.
He then helped Allo recover from falling to level three and turned St Mirreen's lowest position into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Fallkirk, St Mirrene and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real crossroads," he recalled the takeover of Allo.
“I really believed that leadership was more suitable for me than playing games.
It seems strange, because I did it, I got a reasonable income, and I enjoyed some top moments.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do on a weekly basis.
I still experience this in terms of the stress and pressure of my work, but the management just seems more appropriate.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it.

According to the survey, the best time for a stack on Saturday at 17.30 a.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of British pubs in distress, but the pressure has been increased on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that pubs and bars’ turnover rose by 2.7% in July, but restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA company, who compiled these figures, said: “The longer the expected participation in world championships of sunshine and England meant that July was similar to June when pubs’ turnover grew by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants became even more difficult.
In June, 1.8% of restaurant trade declined further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars were the most successful, and restaurants are the least liked.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, while the sale of food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, analyst for free time and hospitality, said: “These results will continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and large social or sports events remains the greatest factor in selling outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the fall in sales by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.

One of the five children has secret social media accounts they hide for their parents
The study resulted in one of the five children, some of whom are 11 years old, having secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents and teachers
A study of 20 000 gymnasts found an increase in “sold Insta” leaves
In the new heightened fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic account" designed to show their parents
The study resulted in one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creating secret social media accounts that they hide for adults.
A study carried out among the 20 000 gymnasts found a significant increase in the “student Insta” accounts (visa image sharing page Instagram).
In the new heightened fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a "basic account" designed to show their parents and made it acceptable for themselves.
One discoverer of his 13 - year - old daughter's secret page saw that the teenager invited others to rape himself.
The Digital Academy UK and the organisation connecting private schools Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half recognized the existence of private accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing to see that so many teenagers are tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the spokesperson of athletes at Scottish Athletics' board
At the annual meeting of the Executive Board of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive manager of the management.
Doyle is Scotland's most respected light powerist and Chairman Ian Beattie described what had happened as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, the U.K. and elsewhere in sports communities, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will reap the benefits of inviting his leadership,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesperson for athletes and I hope that I can contribute to the development of Scotland’s sport in real terms.”
The American who won four Olympics at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996 at 200 metres and 400 metres, and now often shares his opinion in the BBC, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I recover and, if so, to what extent, only time would show.
I've done a lot of hard work, but I completely restored, I learned to walk again, and I'm already doing speed trainings!
Thank you for encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising that compares women to cows divides the Internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two camps of advertising comparing the nursing mother to milking cows.
According to the reports, a technology company for consumers to mark the world's first silent breast pump presented similar advertising to Elvie's ironic music video to present the freedom this new pump gives to the mothers who want to live.
Four real mothers dance in a table filled with hay with cows and sing: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see me in the tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, they’re not breasts, they’re my breasts.”
It says: “Pump, pump, feeding children, pump, pump, filling my ladies with milk.”
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has given rise to conflicting opinions on the Internet.
77,000 video viewers with thousands of comments disagree, and many of them say that it illuminates the tents of the dairy industry.
“The use of softs for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
As we do, they must become pregnant and born to produce milk, but the difference is that they are being stolen from children in read days after birth," wrote one.
Elvie’s breast pump does not stick the breast-feeding breast-feeding eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “It is very traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these children to keep the mothers' breast pumping?"
Someone added: a completely inefficiencies of advertising."
One woman thought the story was super fun.
“Leian that this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy myself one of those if I was still breast-feeding.
The pumping of milk made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another remarked: “This is a fun advertising for mothers who are often in their workplaces or in their bathrooms and who are known as cows.
This promotion does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they have all danced into bras, not with eye-to-face pumps.
The campaign idea is based on saying that many breast - pumping women feel like a cow.
But Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires or pipes and does not appear in the breast-feeding chest, giving women freedom to move, keeping children and even walking outside during pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and annoying introduction.
Compared with women's expression opportunities and milk industry cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting entertainment and a familiar key to extraordinary freedom, which the new pump creates.
It's not the first time the news has reflected Elvie's pump.
At London’s fashion week, the mother of two children bearing Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared on the screen.
Thousands of migranates' children went quietly along the Texas border to camping camp.
The number of children of arrested migrants has risen sharply, although the monthly cross-border crossings remain pretty similar. Partly, because the tough rhetoric and policy of the Trump administrator has made it difficult to set up children with the help of sponsors.
Usually most sponsors are immigrants with documents and are afraid to violate their country’s possibility to remain, requiring the child’s right to care.
The risk increased in June when the national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household could provide fingerprints and data sharing with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs officer, admitted to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people who requested financial support for the minors who were not present.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were missing the criminal past.
‘Almost 80 percent of sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion are in criminal background.
So let's keep tracking them," said Mr. Albence.
To deal with children more quickly, officials enforced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest.
Many defend their legal content to the judge by videoconferencing, to come in.
Unfits are sent out of the country quickly.
According to asylum staff, and based on the reports published in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they will become nervous or depressed, which may lead to violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more active in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulty may be missed by the size of two eyes.
They added that moving children to the tentlands without giving enough time to get used to feeling or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many are already in difficulty.
Syria calls for the immediate departure of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home in the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been in war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces on the Syrian surface were and are treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally," he said in the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria’s “war against terrorism is almost over”. Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions have left its homes.
He said that Damascus will continue “to fight in this sacrificial war until we have cleaned the entire Syrian territory” both from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign force.”
The United States has about 2,000 forces in Syria, mainly training and consulting Kurd units as well as Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In France, there are more than 1,000 forces in the war-roasted country.
Speaking of the war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are appropriate and he accused of the misunderstandings of the unwitting fears that prevent refugees from coming, spreading some of the Western countries.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their neighbors," he said.
"They are politicizing something that is merely a humanitarian problem."
The United States of America and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted recovery aid until the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to United Nations diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates Idlib's buffer for the last rebel reference point, has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Türg agreement prevented the widespread raid of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed the fact that the treaty had "explicit deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be hit by gjihadists, including Nusra Front warriors associated with Al-Qaida, who would "be destroyed".
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura of the United Nations is about to persuade the first meetings of the new Committee of Government and opposition members to design the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for election.
Moualem made demands for the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the current articles of the Constitution and warned of intervention.
Why Trump is also chosen for another term of office
According to this logic, Trump could win in the next elections in 2020 if the withdrawal of office and the scandal had not previously completed his presidential office, as it is likely to be requested by liberal viewers.
What would undoubtedly be the most exciting end of the President's Office?
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, top class ratings have doubled in CNN to more than 1,05 million and MSNBC almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak hour. Compared to four-year membership 1.7 million viewers, their number has risen. MSNBC is receiving the Rachel Maddow Show 3.5 million cable viewers to keep this rating high during the main evening news.
“This is the tension we have been involved in because we do not understand it,” ABC said the Head of Government Secretary, who will be president when the attack destroys Parliament’s building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced comedy writing and book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneating Into the Hollywood Boys Club,” author, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride before the 2016 elections in Boston.
The driver told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked
"He said he was making me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell to me.
All of this chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, not like the rest of the TV show, Washington's rumors can be fatal to the future of Roe v Wade and re-coup from wanted immigrants to families and to the global economy.
To avoid doing so is simply the luxury of the viewers.
However, the six-hour discussion of Bob Woodward’s “ fundamental background” of his book “Fear” and Paul Manafort 13 225,73€ paying jaanalinnahast Bomber jakki (Washington Post said that it was “extremely self-confident in the clothing”) and the behinds of Stormy Daniels regarding Mr Trumpi anatomy’s butter description, the viewer is more than a trained citizen.
I, for example, never see Super Mariod feel the same way again.
“One of his activities, which may seem to be a real life series, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the author of the series “Brent Montgomery Trump” with interim performances and daily plans (i.e. nodding with NFL, praiseing Kim Jong-uni).

On the other hand, the cash flows go into the most acute White House snacks.
It is no wonder that the 17th district of Pennsylvania will receive cash flow due to the restructuring of the Congress Area by receiving two dominant companies on the same site.
As a result, Conor Lamb, from the Democratic Republic of Pittsburgh, who won the place in the second district in the extraordinary elections last spring, was again elected.
The opposite candidate for the Lamb is Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the previous 12th district of Pennsylvania, which in the larger section overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were converted after the January decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, so the old districts were divided into anti-derivative electoral regions, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th elections have launched a campaign that undermines the financial departments of the largest political parties - the Congress Committee on Democracy's campaign (DCCC) and the People's Committee of the Republics' campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after the button won a lot of viewed March in Pennsylvania on the 18th Congress District during extraordinary elections.
This is where the Republican has taken place several decades and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the region.
Political speakers have given the Democrats a small advantage.
USA El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognised Beijing, which was a small setback to Washington.
Mr Trump met in June 2017 in a friendly atmosphere with President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw Trump out the management team.
The Foreign Ministry officials decided to call on the American leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, as the Minister's spokesperson Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had not recently supported Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, who received 140 million dollars of aid from America in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic impetus, was planned to be punished.
The recommended penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American State and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organise the waste at a similar meeting last year, seen as a development of efforts to prevent the movement of settlers to the United States.
But in the middle of September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue consulting and to end the debate on any El Salvadoran penalties.
According to the diplomats, the Vice-President, Mike Pence, is now being criticised for speaking at the mid-October meeting to talk about government positions.
And three American ambassadors returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new tough notices or punishments from Washington.
The White House, Mr Bolton's spokesperson, refused to comment on the spoken details of three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national debates at the request of anonymity.
These discussions were confirmed by a close analyst to the government, who also spoke at the request of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen is that special prosecutor Robert Mueller publishes a report on the possible jurisdiction of Trump, which has a lot of evidence in the public archives.
Mueller claims to investigate in his study whether Trump's campaign relates to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change the party, Trump would have to understand in this institution the way he would go back to the voters and perhaps even his elderly judges.
There are many buts here, and I do not want to point out that the guarantee of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all need to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the sustainability of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to turn against Hitler if only Lääs had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Münichi.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-annual slaughters.
History moves around the jealous march of such turning points and democracy is closer or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires the prosecutor's assistant director Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a boiling water since he was announced that last year he proposed a presidential secret recording and was speculating the incompatibility of that post.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
“How to react if the investigation of Brett Kavanaugh, justly requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, above all, are we voting for Congress in central elections if Trump is to be held responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter vacation.
But I don't think we're gonna fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Jew in Czechoslovakia who was taken over by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz, who once took over and used our ambassador home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me the light of the tails on a table with a hammer.
With such a legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans is Rapid Vienna pre-optimistic
In the Rangers, Rapid Vienna will organise Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which was followed earlier this month in Spain against Villarreal, will put them in a strong position to get the Group of the European League G.
The knee injury did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans to use this result as a jump table before the first show of season 2 : 2 video games against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use it as a jump table for better results.
“This was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went into the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair result.
They were better during the first half of the game, and we were in the second half again.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it's gonna be a hard game because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was difficult, because of this, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move on now, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few of their family members discussed it.
About half of the Nationwide researchers said they were talking to their husbands about long-term care expenses.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“The people want family members to take care of them, but they do not talk about it,” explained Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
However, this should begin.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare for your family if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family, discussing where and how to get care, as these choices may be extremely important in terms of costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid financial policies for life insurance to help cover these costs, or early self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop any possible legal battles already in the process.
Get yourself a healthcare license to identify a client who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes while you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the trust in your finance.
Choose a reliable person who would make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid even if you are ineffective.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so you'll be ready if you need them.
"This is not just a financial side, but is also important, who would be doctors?" Martin explained.
‘What are the medicines needed?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Place it all."

Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, former governor of Alaska and senior son of Vice-President Sarah Palin have been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasillas, Alaska, in respect of suspicions of domestic violence, in the report on domestic violence, in relation to intervention and opposition to arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to inform the police about the alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palini is held at Mat-Su's pre-investigation facility and is held against a $500 bail guarantee, reported U.S.A.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, where he declared that he was “not guilty in any case,” reported the news network.

Federal prosecutors in NYC requesting a suspected rare death penalty in a terrorist attack
The New York federal prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people were killed, and this rare punishment has not been committed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used Home Depot's rental car to attack the bicycle road along West Side's roads in Lower Manhattan, taking both pedestrians and bicycles on their way in October.
According to the death penalty request issued in the southern part of New York City, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed eight victims intentionally and also caused serious injuries.
Both cases constitute a possible death penalty on the basis of court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented a 22-point charge to Saipov, which included eight murder charges with extortion, which are generally used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal offences, and charges against violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack assumed “sufficient planning and planning,” the prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s activities as “consumptioning, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pagnucco’s family and friends,” states the intention.
Five victims were tourists in Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last case of the New York Southern District District District District District Court.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of two drug dealers, but the outcome was that he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The most recent death penalty was executed in New York in 1953 in a federal incident in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when a couple was executed in a conspiracy to carry out a spyage on behalf of the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed at electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, the brute of the worm, showed the absence of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he had told the investigators that he was happy about what he did.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to take the ISIS videos viewed from his phone.
According to the police, he also requested an ISIS flag in his hospital palace.
In a 22-point charge, he hasn't taken the blame.
David Patton, one of Saipov's national defenders, said that they were “really disappointed”.
"In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty will extend the trauma of all those involved, rather than life imprisonment, of being guilty of being released. "
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty.
According to a member of Tory, NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed by Brexit to lead the negotiations.
Mr Farage, during today's protest at the Tory Conference, promised to "mobilise the population army".
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to feel the “hot” of Eurosceptics, as one of the members of Theresa May's own Parliament recommended that they lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative minor member, said March in Birmingham that UK “was already outside by now” when Mr. Farage was Secretary of Brexit.
But Mrs May is faced with the problem of reconciliation her deeply divided lines, which were emphasised by the conservatives who were in favour of staying, joining their protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping his Chequers plan in the middle of the Brexit supporters, the remaining ones and the EU attacks.
The allies requested that it continue the transaction with Brussels despite the conflict and force Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between their own package and "disaster".
Bone said at the gathering of Leaves Leave in Solihull that he wanted to “resist on Chequers’ plan”.
He recommended making Farage a partner and giving him responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
'On his responsibility, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough, a member of Parliament, added: “I am standing outside for Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers’ plan.”
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Andrea Jenkyns, who supported Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told the reporters: “I only want one: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote in favour of it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and even choose us.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening."
He added: “The prime ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that politicians who had been in the meeting should be made to feel “hot” when they plan to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us — a people — and our political class. ”
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let it happen."
He added to the enthusiastic audience: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the side of Brexit’s betrayal, uncomfortable.
"We will mobilise the population army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-government, proud Britain."
At the same time, the remaining ones marched through Birmingham before a two - hour meeting held at the center of the city.
The full-blown activists turned out to be the story of "Theors against Brexit" after the team was set up this weekend.
In Adoni, the Liberal Lord looked at the conservatives for the security issues that were part of their party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who say that IT systems can be established and that all technology can be moved to Canada and more, to a smooth border crossing, to trade without cross-border restrictions in Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
It's like there's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
According to the U.S. Elizabeth Warren, he is seriously considering running for President after the elections in November.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democracy spoke of its future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts raehouse.
Warren, President Donald Trump's frequent critic, will be nominated in November by GOP National Representative against Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
Speculation is that he could be against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at the raehouse after Trump's appointment.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, which means that it's also on the ground."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Cup after a team record gave him victory over Sebastian Vetelt
From that moment it became clear that the Valtter Botta qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Mercedes team's order plays a major role in the race.
Bottas started a good start, and he almost forgot about Hamilton's position on the first two occasions, and he invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went into boxing stops and left the Hamilton Group's back door in close traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after Vetelt, but Hamilton went to lead after the side-by-side state, when Ferrari's leader left the door open to pass the inner courtyard after the third collar tried to protect it with double motion.
Max Verstappen started a competition from the back of the grid and was at seventh place at the end of his 21st birthday.
He then led the contest for most of the time, driving the rubbers to the finish and passing to Kimi Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally drove to the box stop on the 44th round, but he couldn't increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen a fourth place.
Today is a hard day because Valtter worked hard all week and was a real gentleman along with me.
“The honey has done a great job to have one of two,” said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at his meeting on Saturday because of an incident that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused the Supreme Court as a nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking about the Western Virginia assembly, the President was not directly addressed to the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, but, instead, he commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment, showing that people are “evil, evil and lying”.
“The only thing that can happen and is now a beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate for a few days is that you see anger and anger, evil, disgusting, and lying people,” he said.
“ When you look at press releases and leaks that you say: ‘ Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, “Did you leak a document? ” — Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Whether we leaked... no, we didn't leak," he added with the senator's look.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July on charges against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill reported: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s charges or leak his story,” said Feinstein to the Committee.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and, according to his request, I did so."
However, his denial was not appropriate for the president who commented: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
As he continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse of three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would use these charges for their own ends.
‘They have decided to take back the power without selecting the funds.
They are not interested in who they hurt, who they need to drive over to get power and leadership," said the President of the Media.

"Are you ready for this?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, the city of Lomboki, Indonesia, was hit by an earthquake where more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia accident: According to Air Niugin’s airline, one man has disappeared after the crash in the lagoon
Although it was said in the past that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane, now claims that an air carrier led by the Pacific substation in Micronesia has disappeared.
Air Niugin said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon, they couldn't find one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find him.
The airline did not immediately answer the details of the passenger, such as its age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed to the airport of Chuuki Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, but they were stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the air carrier and the United States Marines said that the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the flight path.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very low when it landed.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to take a sinking plane in a ravine height in the water to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that cabin crew had panicking and screaming and that he had a little head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and seamen working on a nearby hill also helped rescue by using full - breathing boats to bring people to the shore before the plane fell about 30 metres below water.
The aviation safety network data show that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered to PNG in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst is preparing a schedule for the evening she was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed the case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert observer in analysing intelligence.
He pointed out to the jury how he used cell phone extracts to re-create the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellise and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers at the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellos was with Chambers the night that his wife died, which was contrary to previous statements by a young man.
When you showed him to have been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which led the police to speak with Sanford.
Sanford stepped into the courtroom on Saturday and admitted he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Order had told the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that he said "sounded because my car was in Nashville".
Another mismatch was that Order said that he had known Chambers before his wife died for about two weeks.
The phone records showed that the Nazis had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, He ordered Chambers messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He deleted her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is about to make its trial call on Sunday.
The judge said he thought that the case would go to the jury at a later date in the same day.

Another black guy?
The New York sitter is suing a racist message for a couple of courts.
The New York sitter is suing a discriminatory dismissal after a couple of family members who had accidentally received a message where Mother complained that the nanny was "seven black".
Couples deny that they're racist compared to blackmailing the situation.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her regret when she learned that their new lasser service provider Giselle Maurice was black when he came to work for the first day of 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying: "EIIIIIIIIIIII, JJJEEKORDNE MUSTANAHALINE."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after his prohmaka's understanding of Miss Maurice, claimed that their social babysitter, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for her instead of a Filipino.
Miss Maurice was paid one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple of courts to get the compensation he wants to receive in a daily amount of 350 dollars for the next six months, and the same work he was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them to look at, so do,” said The Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
A few have rejected the claim that they were racist, saying that ending working with Maurice was a reasonable thing, because they were afraid that they could no longer trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t think about.
He's not racist.
"We are not racist," said the wife's wife to Joel Plasco's newspaper The Post.
“But would you give your children to keep one with whom you have been rude, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison of blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “very difficult”.
“ Would you go against someone like that?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case remains, the public opinion has quickly condemned a couple in social media, where they are severely criticised for their conduct and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the readers would not communicate with the talking bear.
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born just after the book was adopted, said: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who first read it before it was published.
It's very fun now to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He said that his father, given his inspiration to write a children's book about a little gamer, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was with a nucleus shelter because of his father's death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who he described as “a very important member of our family” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was quite a quiet man and was not a proud person, ” he said.
“But since Paddington was so true to him, it was as if your child could achieve something: you are proud of them, though it is not your achievement directly.
I believe he has looked at the success of Paddington in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On the way down, his daughter was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were working in vain to save her life.
“They called regularly to say that the daughter’s condition was very bad and that they did not believe that she would survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nadia, who said that my daughter will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
Soon I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating had started to disappear quietly and leave his system.
He was dead a while before that, and now all the systems started to stop.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't be shy, screaming or crying because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, now grieving her daughter, got on a plane with other passengers who didn't know anything about her experiences.
"No one knew," he said.
“I kept my head down, and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outbreak of compassion on this flight against Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
The lady's postcards prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide, work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have taped the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to support.
Miss Davis' son Tyler was 13, when she suffered depression, and she was 18, when she killed herself.
“I do not want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
A 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“ Everyone knew about his smile.
They always said his smile would make the whole room shine."
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place with them.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said: “I constantly worry that it has a domino effect.”
Ms. Davis created these maps “to let people know that there are people to approach and talk to, even with their friend.
Don't shut up – you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Miss Davis for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner not long after his mother's death.
“He did not say that he felt bad or depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during the first Christmas day – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye bond with them or anything."
Ms. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma to them, but they must cope with it: “It will tear the wound into the entire family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we must go ahead and continue the fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on top of his hair while the FBI starts an investigation
“I believed that if we could actually get what he wanted – a limited time and scope study — we might be able to achieve unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would “buy up” in the middle of the permanent partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their resistance was due to the era.
In just five weeks, November 6, when the Republicans are not expected to go well, they are greatly weakened in their intentions to be the most wanted man in the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators by lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI gives his report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
At the moment, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive voice and to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of military runners "will grow" under Kim's government
South Korean legislation has said that the number of North Korean troops in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seg, quoted by South Korea's merger ministry data, said that compared to the 2011 military runners (2706), their number has fallen last year (1127).
Mr Park said that key factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traders.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of northern drunkards have been offered South Korea citizenship.
According to Journal Seoul, there are more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War to illegally cross the border in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest state border with North Korea, and which is easier to overcome than a heavily protected area between Korea.
China is taking military yoga as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to the country with force.
North and South Korean relations, technically still in the war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of the ceasefire.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uni in Singapore, where they generally allowed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress in sanctions.
"Untrusted by the United States of America, our country has no security security, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to make ourselves unilateral first," said Mr Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said that a man is unfit for referee of the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, opposition leader of the House of Electorals, appointed the Judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical” and said that the man is not technically qualified as Judge of the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, an interview took place in Austin, Texas at Tribune Festival.
“I was bound to point out that if a woman had been so involved, she would have been named hysterical,” said Pelos regarding her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate’s judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied accusations that he had been sexually assaulted by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, describing his family and high school years, at times he almost shouted and was found to be speechless.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party who had been on the Committee, appointing the allegations against him against the loss of the 2016 presidential election of Hillary Clinton as an organised “grotes and coordinated reputation” of the angry Liberals.
According to Pelosi, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man was not a judge of the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was embezzled against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifys himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
The game remained modest when he was asked whether he would try to withdraw him if Kavanaugh was confirmed if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Electorals.
“I say so much – unless he tells the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only fit to judge the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to the court where he is working,” Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of Columbia District Appeal Court.
As a democracy, he added that he was concerned about the decisions against the Affordable Care Act (health law — translator’s comment) or Roe v Wade (a court-lawable for abortion – translator’s comment) because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would cancel some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not a time for a hysterical person to become a judge and wait for us to say that it is not nice,” Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It is a righteous choice of speech, a perennial and overlapping anger, and it cannot escape without crying about it.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was somewhere in charge; he said that she cried as well as when she got angry, but she developed a method in which she got angry and started crying, and she said to someone she was talking to, ‘ You might think I was crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are partly accepted as an output of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most original memories is an early job in the men's office, where I once found myself in an unspeakable rage crying when one of the oldest women – a strict leader I had always been a little afraid – grabbed me from a collar and dragged me into a stairbag.
"Don't ever show them how to cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and it gives them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Democratic Party Congress of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart for the presidential election campaign of the man.
In 1987, when Hart got caught on board a yacht called the Monakey Business and ended the campaign, Schroeder was deeply upset that there was no reason why he should not be thinking about running for office himself.
"It was not a well-designed decision," he said to me, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was someone else's accession."
Someone said it's like "The Snow White and the Seven Thumb boys."
Since the campaign was about to end, he was late to collect money, and he promised not to run unless he could get two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave men 1,000 dollars gave him just 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm gonna get a benefit?" he thought.
When he made a speech that he announced was not running an official campaign, feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him, irritation against the system that made it difficult to turn to voters instead of money collection and delegates, and anger against sex — he was so overcome that he came to tears in his throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the press reaction against him.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my tombstone.
"He cried?"
How the US-China Trade War might be of benefit to Beijing
The opening moments of the US-China trade war were sad and, although the battle is far from over, the interstate gap between Beijing could be beneficial in the long term.
United States President Donald Trump made the first warning notice this year by imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs of USD 200 million (EUR 150 million) in terms of value, with taxes imposed on the parties from China on goods arriving in the USA.
Beijing has answered the same thing every time, with the last five to ten per cent tariffs of USD 60 million for American goods.
China has made a promise to the US to respond to the fire, and the second largest economy in the world is likely not to blink as soon as possible.
Getting back to Washington would mean an agreement, but publicly worshiping the U.S. would be too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing’s cards are correctly issued, trade war with the US can support China in the long term by reducing the interdependencies between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that lead to the loss of control over the economy in another country is in fact much more dangerous than the individuals who have previously acknowledged,” said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on research into Asia at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready to return to volunteer refugees and asks for more than seven years after the war to rebuild the country.
Speaking with the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
"The situation on the territory of the State is even more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore normality to the regions destroyed by terrorists.
Now there are all the conditions that refugees who have left the country on a daily basis and because of unilateral economic measures that have affected their lives and lives could voluntarily return to the country.
According to the United Nations forecast, 55.5 million Syrians have fled since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be pleased to accept aid for the construction of a damaged state.
At the same time, he stressed that the State would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe has won Ryder’s Cup Competitions in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup Competition in 2018 by subjugating in Paris near Le Golf National Golf Course with the final result of the U.S. team 16,5 vs 10.5.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soils and has not won Ryder's Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the Danish team, Captain Thomas Bjorn, received 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
During the whole tournament, the campaign had been the star of the US, Phil Mickelson, hit the bricks on the par-3 track in 16 waters, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinar shined in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who has started the tournament in the current format in 1979 resulting in 5 : 0 : 0.
With a result of 5&4 to the American Jordan Spieth, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen, who is the lowest of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, had 2nd and 1st Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have been the last one in Ryder's cup race.
Of the eight Ryder Cup Competition veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the 25,5 most winning Europeans of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It is about the spirit of the team, and I am glad that I was able to help," said emotional Garcia for Europe's victory.
He gives the torch to his fellow man Jon Rahm, who won the US Golf League Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I feel extraordinary proud that I won Tiger Woods — I grew up looking up,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four fights in France and now he has a career in Ryder's Cup Competitions as a result of 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who have won 14 big competitions, leaving only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was in the middle of finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointment of the team, Captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the guys, they were fireflies.
There was a moment in the morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Put the hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, we'll work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Competition Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to light up the hat.
We were played better."
New information about water smelting: decreased concentration in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasotas
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Lifestyle Commission (FWC) shows a reduction in the overall concentration of flowering algae in the Bay of Tampa region.
According to the FWC, there are reports of lush flowering in the Pellales, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier provinces, which indicate decreasing concentrations.
The water well is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of the Province of Pinellas to the southern part of Lee County.
