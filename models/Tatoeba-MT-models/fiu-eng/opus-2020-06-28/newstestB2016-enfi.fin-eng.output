The 9-year-old boy on leave in Tampere found
Police have had a search mission because of the 9-year-old boy's escape trip to Tampere on Tuesday night.
From West Tampere, with his friend, the missing son report has spread on social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no life- and health hazard.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanom half-night in the knowledge that he was found.
He's fine, and now we're starting a follow-up.
The boy was found in the immediate vicinity of the home. Dad told me.
Ronaldo, again, as a wretched man, tears the difference in paint to Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league during the weekend and continued his work on the Master's league.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo on the league of the Masters turned for at least a moment for the latter's benefit.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time goaling statistics when he shot a visitor into the Shahtar Donetsk network with two hits of penalty matches and one of the play situations.
Ronaldo took his goalboard to 80 when, before Tuesday with him, the Barcelona Mess has 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0.
The Juventus has been koshering in the Italian football league at Serie A since the beginning, but in the Master's league D section it began with a 2-to-1 guest victory from Manchester City.
The victory battle was over ten minutes before the end of the Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city stunned the absence of a knee-stamping Sergei Aguero.
The Aguero who was injured in the weekend election game came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
The second group of Manchester, United, also experienced hard times in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2-tapp.
The 20-year-old ManU wingman Luke Shaw's guest match only lasted 15 minutes.
The dangerous-looking slip of Hector Morenon in PSV hit the paint towards an attacked manu pack so badly that Shaw probably broke the leg.
Shaw slept with Eindhoven's home stadium grass for ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to 1-0th minute, but Manu's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno set off before the break at the extra time.
In the second half of the PSV victory scene, Luciano Narsingh made it.
The Landing season in the Master's league began with Paris Saint-Germain.
The case had been changed by Angel Di Maria, Argentina, the PSG-sniff of Manchester United.
Di Maria broke through the right and pulled the ball into the back corner by Malmo's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for the second half of the PSG.
PSG has been pulled into the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's EUR-longer, is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the PSG starger, met for the first time with his professional career’s departure company Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, Moscow TsSKA, lost the B block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a distinction - the president gave the wrong speech
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has re-introduced the same speech he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently realized that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91 years old in full breath.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants were rushing to say that the confusion had taken place exclusively in Mugabe’s leadership and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed the impact of China on the economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional meeting of EU leaders next week as a result of the refugee crisis.
Mr Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, leading up to summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make Europe more effectively registered.
The negotiations on asylum seekers are set out in Merkel's table.
Professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University asked for a voice in an emergency call to make a little bit of a police call to his home and told him that he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their dear dog was here and alive and probably in fear. Professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
The cops inside the house found the body of Amy Prentisss and the message written on the white paper: "I'm very sorry and I hope I can cancel what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me", according to a letter signed by the authorities.
There was no sign in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers away to the campus of the school. Police found Ethan Schmidt, the professor of the history of the campus, who was believed to have been shot by the Lamb.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university official received information about the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
She said Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after this.
One more death in the day, and the Lamb took his life when the police reached him.
The next day, students and teachers kept their viscose behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive.
The researchers examined the details in both places, and the people who knew Lamb told me about the man, and a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher was born to researchers.
Students always said that they had been looking forward to the professor's hours.
According to the Gautier Police Department of Prentisss, the professor had no prior history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned in his book Lamb, which gave recognition to the people he was able to live a academic life with.
Both worked at the Institute for Social Science and History, which included 17 people, and many of the students attended the courses of both men.
However, references to the problems arose.
The lady who called the Lamb, Brandon Beavers, told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "like she had a problem."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about his stress at the end of the academic year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously applied for a sickness leave at Delta State University due to some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay policy meant that a claim for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
William LaForge, Director of the University, told me that he was not aware of the conflicts between the Lamb and Schmidt, but he said that there was a clear problem with the Lamb.
You can no longer answer these questions, Lamb.
After leaving campus, the police discovered the route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississip.
Before the police reached Lamp, he had taken his life with a 38-calibre pistol in the back yard of Mississippi Greenville, about a mile away from his parents' home, the D.C. Department's medical examiner, Methel Johnson, told me.
Lamb's car was still in the yard.
But Johnson told me he believed that he knew the people in the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started his work as a teacher in science and education at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
In the spring, she got her doctorate in the education science.
One of Lamb’s most long - term friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that she met Lamb's common friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20 years old.
He was still in high school with his friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried for years to teach Hairston a guitar play.
"The lamb was quite a heart attacker back then.
All the girls were on her feet," told Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but no document says they're not dedicated.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a small town of Gautier in the riverside building.
According to the police, the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentisss, Shawn O'Steen, told me that he was divorced from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was so shocked," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"The girl and mother were the best friends."
O'Steen had never met Lamb but heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both attended the summer event three years ago.
Later, they used to call together.
O'Steen said his daughter would write and play her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and a part-time entertainment coordinator in the modest The Jules Room restaurant outside Gautier, reported that he had seen Lamp and Prentiss on 5 September, when Lamb had called guitar and lipstick for a few audiences.
Nothing said anything about something being wrong.
"The happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were talking together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"The professor Schmidt, who received his heart, directed the seminars of the first year and specialises in the history of Indians and migrant times", told Professor Don Allan Mitchell in England.
He was married, and he had three little kids.
He studied at the Empire State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and college.
The Delta State University campus in Cleveland has 900 people gathered at a Memorial in the candlelight. There were educational staff, other staff, students and residents.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the night event where the university choir presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amating Grace."
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
It's a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland.
Helpful journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagner Pettus in Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police now tell us that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was further specified that even though Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and babies reports that he is offering his current employees and seasonal workers an opportunity for additional hours of work.
The company intends to hire 40 000 people for shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
The interviews will begin this month, and new workers will begin in October to December.
Although there are months of vacation, the trade season is approaching well, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for shops and delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his date with Princess Diana.
Back to the future - the first night of the film was Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royals. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. I was white to me that Princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox said the coming back in Time document on the trailer.
"When the movie began, I realized that the situation reminded me of a date with Princess Wales."
The Back in Time document relates to the Back to Future films, and in addition to Fox, they interview Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd and director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Return to the future The movie received 30 years ago from her first night.
"This film is definitely a time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format, and will be presented in selected cinemas from October.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, commented on Russia's enhanced military efforts and notes that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons only cause more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again invited all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference held on Wednesday, Ban announced its intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, in order to discuss the situation in Syria, which would be scheduled for the ministerial week of the UN General Assembly to be held this month.
Ban regretted the fact that the decentralisation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional authorities has led to a situation which is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, the Ban called for five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity as reached in Iran's nuclear agreement.
8 chapters on suffering claims: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trump has been tried to make blank noise.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some predict to Trump the collapse.
The Republican circles have, for the 11th time, all efforts were made to pull Trump down from the gallup cord.
Ten national gallupers show Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of which are already seriously considering what it is actually saying about the scope of the property complex.
However, the elections are only in the early stages.
It has not yet been announced that Trump will be elected Republican candidate.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was in the gallbladder, was able to give space to the ascending Herman Cain, and neither finally won the candidate plant in any of the states.
Trump would have a hard time having a public election for a number of reasons.
External groupings such as Jeb Bush Super PAC as well as the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have noted Trump’s strong position and started to dig its stone to pour him.
The following fresh gallup data show that the real estate module cannot be ignored by the shoulder adjustment:
There's been a complete translation of Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he was to stand as a candidate in mid-June, according to Monmouth University gallup, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive image of real estate molgus.
By mid-July, 40 per cent had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans are a positive picture of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures are also held in the states where the elections will be held first.
In the last week's Quinn Market Galllup 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two third Republicans would be satisfied with Trump's nomination.
At the gallup of CNN and OCR last week 67 per cent of Republicans said that they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible choice of candidates.
Only two out of ten would be extremely unhappy with Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson is almost as enthusiastic as Trump (43% would be very pleased with Carson's candidate and 40% for Trump's nomination).
Who is next the most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a share of 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected as party candidates.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is problematic.
Donald Trumpi has been widely criticised for the power and offensive comments. 52% of Republicans' supporters think the properties of the real estate module are suitable for the presidents. The views are reflected in the opinion assessment of ABC News and Washington Post.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the party meeting is held first: according to Quinn Market Gallup, 52% of the Republicans consider Trump’s personal features suitable for the Chief of Defence Forces.
According to ABC and Post's gallup, however, 44% believe that Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament incompatible with the White House.
Republicans start to get used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
According to CNN and OCRC gallup, four out of ten believe Trump's potential.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have wasted their money on Jeb Bush's behalf.
Total: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in their use before.
At this stage in the last elections, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry likely to be a candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans supported another candidate, Trump is covering almost all other candidates.
Some experts believe that the split camp is likely to benefit Trumpi when the opponents of Trump split up with the supporters of the various candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University's opinion survey revealed that in the imaginary double-amping between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always gain greater support.
He leads Carly Fiorina 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points, Rand Paula, John Kasichi and Chris Christie 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take over Trump by 19 points in a fictional double shot.
A strong majority of Trump's supporters have already taken a vote.
According to the gallery published on Tuesday by CBS and NYT, fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation may change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's most highly competitive moment is the neurosurgery Ben Carson, but the voters who have already elected their candidates are twice more likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans share Trump's views on migration.
In his campaign speech called Donald Trump two months ago, migration has been a hot topic for 2016.
Part of the concern is that the massive speeches by Trump deport important American voters from the Republicans and hinder the renewal of the brand.
However, according to the polls published on Monday by ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are on migration issues with Trump.
As long as the migration is in the spotlight, Donald Trump also has.
Dissatisfaction towards administration is at the top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican votes.
According to ABC News and Washington Post's latest opinion, this was the opinion of the Republicans of six out of ten.
These two candidates are also desperate for Washington.
According to the opinion poll carried out by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activities in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% are at the brink of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the elections, Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been very excited
The Labour Party of Labouri's new figure image, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to rise for the first time to refuse David Cameron's interview hour later.
The first six questions were asked by Corby after a little half day, and the media and the workers' representatives followed the man's eyes hard.
Corby has called for less theatre and more facts for weekly performance.
He has also stated that he could skip part of his sittings and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in connection with this meeting. Corby is now subject to parliamentary tests following the assembly of the shadow government and the speech of the Corbyn Trade Union's Central Association's TUC on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to silence the national song during the 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday has been critical of many of the Tory Party representatives. The silence has also ended in the headlines of the front page of several newspapers.
Corbyn’s silence during the national song brought attention
Corbyn's representative pointed out Corbyn's position during the national song, quietly respecting the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the fight against Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, member of Corbyn's shadow government, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have called on the party leader to join the national songs in spite of the opposition of this state.
Ten shadow ministers have refused to go to Corbyn's number-ones, calling for differences in economic, defence and external affairs, and less than a sixth of the party was originally in favour of Corbyn's choice of party leadership.
Robin Brant, author of the BBC's policy, considers that political differences in British EU membership and the strengthening of the government's conditions for granting benefits have been accumulated in the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
At the TUC meeting Corbyn said that Labour intends to propose changes to remove the restrictions in full.
Hours later, Minister for Labour and Pensions of the shadow Government Smith noted that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to fall from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron met during the last decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
The new approach, promised by the policy leader, says that he has chosen the issues to Cameron from his audience for 30 000 proposals.
According to Corbyn, who is elected from the Islington North district, Question Time is too much of a coincidence, and he promises to avoid clever speech and error and to focus on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corby has stated that the shadow minister Angela Eagle is rooting for him with questions, for example, when Cameron is travelling abroad.
Mr Corby has also cast the idea that others could also make a sound sometimes, and he tells us that he has discussed it with Mr Bercow, President of Parliament's House.
After Corbyn's party leadership in 2005 Cameron said he wanted a doll theater-like policy, which is often associated with Question Time, but some years later he admitted that he failed in his efforts.
Since the first time that Question Time was televisiond in 1990, it has been considered a central indicator of the leadership's judgment, the control of the lower room and the position. However, according to the critics, the Question Time has become a caricature, which needs a great deal of reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young photographers
The heart of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for homeless people.
For the group of former street children, a meaningful way to learn and make money has been found.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit photography studio where homeless young people are taught to photograph and earn at the same time.
The BBC News met a young person who was prepared through the project among the first ones.

We're getting stronger in the UK's wage rises.
Punta was strengthened as wages rose in Great Britain, and SABMler pulled FTSE 100 index.
In May to July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in Great Britain compared to the corresponding period last year.
The faster growth than the forecast was the fastest since 2009.
The weight was fixed at 1% and the rate was quoted at 1.5505 USD, which was also confirmed in relation to the euro and quoted at EUR 1.3330.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended in 6.229.21 points.
The largest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course paind 20 per cent when the company received a preliminary purchase offer from AB InBev.
Upon completion of the trade, the two largest brewery companies in the world would combine brands under the same roof, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peron and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9 per cent in the ageing of the positive outcome of the Richmont Group, which focuses on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast.
Glencore’s share rose by 5 % of the mining company’s declared intention to collect shares of USD 2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi’s shares were the largest drop of 4.3% when Goldman Sachs dropped the company’s share prices for sales purposes.
The JD Sports course rose 3.1 per cent after the sport company announced that its return before taxes would increase by 83 per cent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports: Greater wage costs could be detrimental to enlargement
According to Peter Cowgill, the Chairman of the JD Sports Management Board, a minimum wage increase in the United Kingdom would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power will not be enough to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs may jeopardise JD Sports enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches against Ald's turnout
Metcash seeks to secure its IGA store from the control of Aldi in South and West Australia.
In order to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in southern and western Australia, Metcash has launched a grass-rooting campaign against the Australian invasion of Aldin 700 million dollars.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and up to 120 shops in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brand with marketing in mainstream communications and social media and organise events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the Dunsborough ice cream factory Simmo offers a sample in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to the customer in South Australia's football league for a discount price.
Metcashi is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade team organises the annual investment strategy day.
This is a major market because South and West Australia account for nearly 30% of the footprint of Mecashin IGA stores, and in these areas the coverage is higher than that of the IGA sales network of Eastern States.
In southern and western Australia, consumers are known for their neighbourhood, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, market shares are 30% and in Western Australia are 24%, while in the eastern states only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will catch 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst, Tom Kierath, estimated that the sales of IGA dealers could be worth $360 million and the sales of Metcash to $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and reach 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these regions.
The fixed costs of Metcash are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean to it the loss of $113 million before interest rates and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the Eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan's recent investigation suggests that the clients of IGA are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, head of Magellan Financial Group, told us that on the occasion in Melbourne, Metcash will be very likely to disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly take a position on Douglas' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the government of Metcash contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has dropped from 18% to 14%, and the result of Metcash’s food business serving 1200 IGA has decreased 43% from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesale operator takes countermeasures and makes over $150 million of Australian dollar annual rainfalls to respond to Coles' and Waliworths prices for hundreds of products every week. Ketju wants to support traders in the reform of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the range of food for their own brands.
According to Metcashi's CEO, Ian Morrice, the price review and business reform plans are in a good hurry, and the company will be able to increase its profits for the first time in 2017.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union, defends Thanas from Kokkinaki
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior instead of his particular criticism.
According to the President of Australia's tennis union, Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a by-product victim of the recent Nick Kyrgios jupeka, and Kokkinakis deserves special attention rather than criticism.
The younger party named "Special K", Kokkinakis, became an unfavorable light challenge when the bad boy Kygrios provoked his opponent in the Stan Wawrinka Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon after that, in a race between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to split his competition twice. "Wawrinka should have given Kyrgyros and me that guy back," Harrison said.
In the open-ended Kokkinakis hit a frustrated mile in the field when the powerful cramps ruined his match. Healy has faithfully defended the Kokkinakis.
At the moment, the teenager is in Glasgow, where he and Sam Groth are fighting for a second-hand game behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been withdrawn according to his dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the American open. He is certainly not the first player to break his mail because of frustration. I know Thanas well enough that he is not proud to perform.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative use of Harrison in the American open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a spell opera around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature to 19 years old, he works hard and completes a very good team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He practices hard, is in good condition and is really stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated on the basis of his own marines."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from Australia’s team on an important round starting as a peryant. Healy describes the solution for a joint decision for all parties involved, but he supports Canberra’s return to the team as a long-term confirmation.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on games instead of being a seismic link with Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the youth has to grow up in the light of publicity. He deserves to be critical of his bad mistakes, but we are trying to support him in order to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to provide him with our own peace. I believe it is best for both the team and Nick."
European migration crisis: Hungary proclaims emergency status, closes borders, arrests migrants
On Tuesday, Hungary declared its southern border of Serbia and captured illegal migrants, which was intended to prevent the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of migrants gathered together into a non-field country, and the Serbian authorities react fiercely.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay on the road between control stations for an unlimited period of time.
The damage began to rise into the surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they said, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian mellac police.
Some started protesting in the food and drink strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it did not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, no more damage.
The situation must be discussed in the near future in Brussels and also in other countries", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
A day later began at the border between Hungary and Serbia when 28 groups of countries failed to develop a common migration policy in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the flood of 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was common, and the hope of reaching an agreement on what EU Member States would receive from 120 000 migrants, including Hungary, was raised at the meeting.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week in order to discuss the continental migration crisis.
However, Hungary did not wish to see urgent action taken by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that, in the two southern regions, public authorities were able to introduce more effective means, i.e. to shut you down and speed up legal processes relating to asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence to the Romanian border in order to prevent the flow of migration flows from the direction that is already ready at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners took part in a tendering procedure between Hungary and Serbia for the completion of the long wire facilities.
In recent months Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and a transit point for migrants to the European Union, and many of these immigrants are refugees from Syria and from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of the people arriving are refugees of the standard of living, not of refugees who are entitled to seek security, and that the view is sharply different from those of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law that entered into force at midnight in Hungary, there is a crime to cross or damage a long wire fence of four metres high, built by the government in the direction of Serbia, which also defines longer periods of imprisonment for convicted human traders.
"In view of the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a state of crisis in the country", President Zoltan Kovacs of the Government told journalists in the southern part of Szeged.
"We follow a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to accept military action that is expected next week. For several days, journalists from the Associated Press News Office have seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Orban’s Internal Security Adviser, Gyorgy Bakemi, said that the authorities have taken the 45 crossing of the border to try immediately at the border and 15 further away.
The people who have reached the border have now been held by the police and are accused of crimes on the basis of new laws.
Authorities are quick to fix the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed down two of the seven border crossing points on Serbia on Tuesday.
Chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roske in Hungary, when Hungarians opened up a small metal container at the point of business where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands stayed out.
The second group of migrants supported the main street, which combines Serbia and Hungary, and people reported themselves in the food and drink law until they were allowed to go to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership in relation to Bernie Sanders contracted by half of the national gallup
The former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's support rate is still two-digit race as a national presidential candidate for the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has exhausted the distance.
Clinton's support is now 47% of the Democrats' votes (decrease from 58%) when Sanders stands for another 27% (from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure in the presidential competition, with 15 percent of his support among the Democrats.
More than five months before the elections for most of the Democrats, it is too early to tell who they are in favour of.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of its choice of other candidates.
After the gallup by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support for a number of democratic groups, while Sanders has joined new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong lead among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed down.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly, and he has only 5 percent of Sanders' support.
Clinton has lost leadership among the Democrats under the age of 50, and now he's in line with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among the older voters.
Over the last month, Clinton's advantage towards Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five-percent neck at Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats say they will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with small reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that the current supporters of Clinton would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected a candidate.
There is more chaos among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton. Only about one quarter would support him with zeal.
48 per cent of democratic voters would be in favour of Clinton. Only 35 per cent of Republican voters, on the other hand, would be eagerly in favour of the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton's voters are freely asked to describe why they are in favour of his nomination, the most popular justification is Clinton's correct experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to elect the female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
There are also common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice President is still weighing up his potential candidate, and 57% of the Democrats would like him to go to the race, but the third one would rather leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidate of the party is asked by the democratic voters, the majority chooses Biden.
After Clinton, more than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate and much more popular candidate for Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the candidate competition for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton will increase his lead with Sanders. Sanders will have 20 percentage points and it will grow by 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton to be a candidate with the best chance of winning actual elections, but the proportion has decreased from 78% last month.
The second Biden is a long way from Clinton, but more people believe that Biden's chances are to win real elections.
However, democratic voters see the views on the issues more important than candidates' win-win options.
No one can be accepted by voters, either democratic or potential candidates.
The voters consider those candidates to be democratic candidates or potential candidates suitable for their characteristics.
Most of them consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and leader types.
Biden is usually described as honest, whereas Clinton is considered most of the type of leader.
As much as 30% of democratic voters consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, Sanders is 15%. 27% cannot say if Sanders is honest.
Democrats believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden near the voters' own ideologicals.
About a quarter of all qualities have no opinion on Sanders.
When the voters are asked for views on the private e-mails of Hillary Clinton and on the use of their own server as foreign minister, the majority of democratic voters say they are pleased with Clinton's statement and have not changed the view of these voters on Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third is satisfied.
The opinion of the people was divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans consider that the use of contested e-mail has not affected their overall image of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in the negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority of six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is scope for improving these features when asking for views of all voters: Clinton considers that only 32% is honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than May.
Of all voters, 62% do not believe that Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country also find Trump as honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trump receive good grades of leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered more reliable.
Most people consider Sanders honest, but just like Carson, many people don't have Sanders' opinion.
The sample of the questionnaire is 351 voters and the error margin for the questionnaire is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson strangles along Donald Trump's front line in a national struggle for suffering.
According to CBS News and the latest attempt by the New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
More than half of the votes cast in the new questionnaire, these two candidates left the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has strong support among the Republican voters in the whole country, which has risen from 23% of the CBS survey carried out before Fox News last month, with 27% of the support expressed on Tuesday.
However, Carson’s support would give rise to a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support for all population groups.
The other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohion Governor John Kasich, will stay far behind.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio, Florida, distributed their third place with a 6% support.
The error margin of 376 Republican voters in the sample is 6 per cent in the direction or in the other direction. The survey was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey of CNN and ORC, last week, Carson's support is rising, with 19 percent of the Republicans in favour of Trump being 32%.
In the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post Trump was also in clear leadership ahead of Carson.
At the last week's meeting with men, Trump made no excuses for a retired neurosurgery, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he was campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the department accused of the death of Baruch College Fuksi
Almost two years ago, five people have been charged with murder after the death of a student in the ritual of the department in Pennsylvania Pocono Mountain.
Baruch College (City University of New York) The members of the Pi Delta Ps department were brutally assaulted by Chu's 'Michael' Deng in September 2013. According to the police department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes had been tied, his back had been put on a drop of almost 15 kg of sand, and he had been repeatedly attacked in his attempt to reach a target placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng is first told that he was complaining about the headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the P. Delta Pss department didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, which they're saying was about an hour before they took Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told us at the press conference that the members were still able to change Deng's clothes, googlata his symptoms and contact the president of the department Andy Mengi.
"At this stage, members began to hide tools to put the department's interests ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
They didn't get Deng to be rehabilitated, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, in the upper body, and traveling with a boring object.
"There are too many families who have been shocked by the merger, because at least one student per year has died as a result of the simulation since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng.
The shareholders and their members must be held accountable where the authorities must take an important step.
The large jury in Monroe County charged five members of the department for the murder of the third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department are accused of symposia and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for the organisation officially approved or unofficially", Wagner announced at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College prohibited the operation of the department, and the national department resigned from the activities of the local department.
Thus, the rise in interest rates of the Central Bank of the United States (Fedin) will affect
The rise in interest rates and the increase in the stock market were beginning to decline, the return on securities increased and the economy collapsed.
That's what we know.
Yet we do not know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
In particular as far as the economy is concerned, we find an indication of timing in history.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raise interest rates, though not always. The determining factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the members of the Central Bank have already stressed that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates, but to the length of normalisation of the situation.
There are, of course, many variables involved.
In the end, however, market participants may find that any increase in interest rates may be excessive.
"The first increase of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money", Julian Jessop, Capital Economics Chief global economics told its customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a frightening state of shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there are no effects.
Examples based on this historical trend of how impacts can be seen in various economic areas:
As has already been seen on the market for about a month, the rise in interest rates may increase instability for some time.
When interest finally rises, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would appear to be the stagnation of interest income on capital for 12-24 months after the first rise, which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy, the Deutsche Bank analyst noted in the recent study on the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
In the 35-year period, the market is generally seen with sharp rises at the time of the increase in interest rates, around 14%, quite smooth following 250 days (mean increase of 2.6%), after 500 days the situation is normalized, and the average rate yield after six partial cycles is 14.4 per cent, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's chief equity strategic Barron's paper.
According to Deutsche, the effect on shares is generally slightly delayed at a later stage, and interest incomes start to decrease.
The recession is an economic reality, but the increase in interest rates tends to do so.
In this case, if the central bank encounters conditions that had not existed in the past and could speed up the fall-off.
Of particular concern is the fact that GDP is at its lowest ever in terms of the rise in the central bank’s central bank’s control interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 interest rates were raised since 1950, only twice the nominal value was less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it to be sustainable and in the third quarter it is 1.5 per cent, says the Atlantic regional central bank.
The increase in interest rates in this sensitive economic situation may be a risk and may be asked if this situation is different, Deutsche said.
The market players have spoken about the increase in the steering interest rate throughout the year, and the views turn to the meeting of the Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategies and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves a lift at this meeting, the future trade seems to be only 25% likely.
"From 1950 onwards all lifting cycles have been in the supercycle, where even before the decline in GDP will rise very rapidly after the rise in the trend", says the report.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst of the season.
Sykli is clearly the longest one the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now is going for 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable for market participants, and the formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change immediately when the first recovery/depreciation cycle starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, the outputs will be immediately reduced", Deutsche stated.
Charles Schwab's strategics believe that the interest rate is going to bring long and short-term bonds closer to each other and to smooth the curve.
"The high-income bonds are often better off in such an environment, although we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, analyst of fixed-income securities.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future turn of the central bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of fiscal adjustment," says Jones.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, the credit risk margins have expanded and the volatility has increased; everyone is in a market-specific situation where the central bank tightens up policies.
Extensively, companies operating mainly in the US market will benefit because the interest rate is falling and local products are starting to attract.
The prospects of the debtors' multinational companies are weaker, as the strengthening dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and the debt more expensive.
"The history shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months", the Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
On average, after the interest rates for 1994, 1999 and 2004, companies with strong balance sheet levels over the past five percentage points.
On average, companies with high return on capital and shares with low volatility were also better able to cope with lower quality, with an average of 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points respectively.
"It's a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rates lose the most," said Goldman.
In addition, consumers outside the stock market will generally benefit from a dollar increase.
Savers will also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for excessive popularization.
According to Bingham, it is difficult today to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
He also claims that the BBC Music Awards Prize is only a copy of the British gala.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Mr. Damien Collins blames the Voice channel for impersonality.
According to a significant parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 will gradually turn into a copy of Classic FM channel.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too populist and that the channel no longer distinguishes from its commercial competitors.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards Classic FM," Bingham said.
Also, the BBC Music Awards Prize, organized last December, will get a critical part from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, organized for the first time in the year, seems to be a British award-winning copy.
These two examples are that instead of new and different things, we are just going through what is already on the market," Bingham says.
The BBC Director-General denied the charges and said that BBC Radio 3 offers commercial competitors with much more live music and enlightening content.
"From Radio 3, I learned from classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel commitment to live music and music is in its very own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 has also committed itself to finding new music and to ordering new works," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, the director of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the station must work harder to maintain public interest, since the British are better acquainted with classical music.
However, radio 3 is not the only one of the hard commercial channels to enter the region of the BBC channel, the restricted cultural, media and sports committee.
Mr. Damien Collins, Parliamentary of the Tory Party, criticised the search for the Voice, which the BBC bought from a Dutch producer, Talpa Media, estimated at £22 million.
"It is not much to discuss because it is not unique or particularly distinguishable."
According to Lord Hall, the program BBC1 produced by Paloma Faith and Boy George was manufactured in a typical way to the BBC.
In addition, Collins demanded that the company look for a hit program on its own bill when it next launched a new entertainment series.
However, Collins did not agree to rule out that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers’ money would be used for other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth in online trade in August – perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, the online store grew by seven per cent.
Net sales have been recorded since 2000. In the last month, growth was the slowest ever.
The online shop was reinforced three years ago by mobile shopping.
Experts believe that a black Friday in November can control the desire to buy.
For more than ten years, the conquest of online commerce has devastated many British shops.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is on the rise, and the new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest throughout the period during which the sales of e-commerce have been statistical, i.e. since 2000. Last year, e-commerce increased by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is on the rise, and the new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If last year's growth is compared to the 2000 figures, it is clear that growth will improve over time", the editor of the IRG, Andy Mulcahy, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, e-commerce accelerated three years ago when consumers took up mobile shopping.
"In this way more and more were able to buy from the network, and it was possible for many to buy in different environments, such as from their own homes.
When mobileisation is now more moderate, growth can be offset."
America's black Friday is a phenomenon which is considered to be one of the reasons for slowing down growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November may lead consumers to postpone their purchase decisions before black Friday.
Last year, 5 times the number of online buyers compared to normal led to the fall of many traders' websites.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which will make consumers tug over after the offers, can control their desire to buy at a different time.
According to a survey published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound of every five pounds was consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from net instead of fashion stores.
In Meka, the victims are buried with crane accidents, the Bin Laden family, in charge of their responsibility.
The Muslims carried 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the large construction company Saudi Binladin Group is responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were injured when the crane fell.
The bodies were carried in high air, when Muslims gathered together to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mekka's Great M.O.
The streets had gathered a number of white people to say good-bye to the victims on their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sadity test was carried by a pilgrimage where the fallen construction crane had only been penetrated one day before through the Moscow roof on the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia calls for the family company of Bin Laden in the construction sector to be responsible for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims were transported in the streets in the Nosturi accident of the Mecca Major-Mother.
Among the dead who died of Nostr were Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Nagy-Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first sacrament.
Akram had been with his parents in the Grandmoskeja, who were about to begin their annual hair - pyja - pyjagism journey.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that there are thousands of people coming to the city for the sacrament.
According to King Salman, Binlad's group should not have left the crane's boom up when the crane was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, Binlad Group is a party to the accident.
The services in English of the News Office did not report in detail. However, according to the English-language information, the Group's management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Great Mosquito. Thousands of Muslims are headed for the hair-spouting of the Greatmosji later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a statement on the issue of nosturinet and no members of the group have been sought for the purpose of the opinion.
The King also accused the Group of its failure to comply with up-to-date safety rules and to cooperate with meteorological experts.
The Cymjet cranes surrounded Mekka's Major Moscay as part of the giant construction project by Binlad Group.
For decades, Bin Laden's family has had close links with Saudi Arabia's ruler family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for a number of significant construction projects.
Al Qaidan's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a delusional son whose family had abandoned the 1990s.
A few days before the pilgrimage of Mecca, who is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life, happened in a harsh rain and in a harsh wind.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities ordered a million rialias (i.e. 250 000 euros) to be paid to victims' families and permanently injured persons.
The other injured persons receive half of the amount of compensation.
According to the B&Q bomb, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind the phenomenon.
The British hire the generals of the home more often, says Veronique Laury.
The benefit has been increased by skilled workers arriving in Eastern Europe, who are employed as professionals.
More than 200 new Screamfix stores are opened for workers.
At the same time Kingfisher closes the 60 B&Q store around the country.
Text: Ruby Steiner, Chief Correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are told to move the home's hammering and painting tools to those arriving from Eastern Europe.
At present, vasarisation and painting skills seem to be few.
The British are now more and more employed by the generals of the home to handle the home's recruitment work, reports B&Q's head of the company behind it.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns a chain of home repair supplies. According to Laury, the phenomenon is the background of skilled workers arriving from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders, while 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more female labor for B&Q shops, because eight out of ten decisions at the store make a woman.
At the moment, most of the personnel are men.
According to Laury, people’s trends should be taken into account, since more and more women living alone today are also renovating their homes.
"Our sales staff are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who are at the top of the companies in the British FTSE 100 index, and he has also reorganised the management team of the company so that there are equal male and female leaders.
Kingfisher is almost the only one in quality, because 50% of its staff are women, including the CEO and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. The diversity is an important subject for us," Laury said.
"I haven't had a hard time finding good women on the board."
Kingfisher's operating profit and sales figures for six months are falling, even though the company had the most hard work after the closure of the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screenfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three ace governments decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The effects were very rapid.
The sharp head of the SAK and other wage centres began to force us to do the same thing, and as a result, the country will stand on Friday because of the widespread demonstrations of workers.
Time for many to think that there will also be a sense of reason.
Well, let's see if it's worth the sheets when it's not good anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet, stating that they are not going to participate in the demonstrations but are going to work.
This would have been impossible in the old days of good consensus.
Of course, there was nothing on the Internet to protest, but openly declaring an offence would have been a small human political suicide.
Millions of trade unions few tens of thousands of people are not much at stake, but think about it.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From an interesting point of view of the Ay movement’s activities, severe government solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
Once, for years, things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight, then, finally, the alliances will have the right to defend, defend, show and make good use of workers' rights.
In this way, the government may want to seize the role of ay movement when membership in the union is seen as perhaps more necessary than ever before.
Whatever it takes to act by organizations, it is silly that Friday's expression of mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped for quite some time.
For example, industrial production has already decreased for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
I think these things are gonna make everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lapland: target 8,5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The University of Lapland will start a savings hearing with a total of EUR 8.5 million in costs.
As part of the savings, the university will start the ‘yth’ negotiations for all staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be spent on other activities.
The background of the Yt negotiations is the 2016 budget, which is expected to be 8,5 million deficits in actual activity.
This will also be affected by the budget cuts made by the Government.
During this financial year, the university will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and the other funding will be EUR 3.2 million.
The university has a total budget of approximately EUR 85 million, so the saving target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate financing on our university is very important, says principal Anneli Pauli in the University of Finland.
Before summer, the effects of surgery were even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with officials will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks under the law.
Yle: Lucky wants Finland's railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also aimed at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, says Souter.
Rail transport is expected to open gradually to competition.
The first is the immediate transport of the capital region in 2017-2018.
After close traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport, the Onnibus plans are welcomed.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has informed other international companies about its interest in rail transport, which also has bus and rail transport in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Time of interest rate decision with the Central Bank of the United States
The whole world will follow the meeting of the U.S. Central Bank Fed on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on the possible increase in interest rates for the first time almost a decade.
The fair half of the economists, who thought the central bank would raise interest rates last week, are now taking the central bank's continuing interest rate rate to between 0 and 0.25%, as shown by the survey conducted by the 80 economists in Reuters.
"This is an historic situation, as the central bank has kept the interest on zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero level and thus trigger normalisation of interest rates," explains the Peterson Institute for International Economics senior researcher Angel Ubide.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of dollars into the balance sheet and has accelerated only a small amount of inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore a global situation which is not one rose.
It has called on the market to prepare for the change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday 20.00 in Central Europe.
Delta State University shooter left an apology card
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later on the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hopes he could cancel it, the authorities said on Tuesday.
On the Mississippi Gautier at Delta State University, Lamb, teaching country and social sciences, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot a man.
Lamb asked the police to go home in an emergency call.
"Ammmu's wife last night", Lamb told me, and he also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, no harm to anyone but probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but the man didn't tell me.
Lamb also didn't tell us the motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found a message written by Amy Prentisss, 41, and Lamb's hand, which reads as follows: "I'm very sorry and I hope I can cancel my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers away to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before taking his life away from himself late on Monday when the police reached him.
William LaForge, Director of the University, told me that he was not aware of the conflicts between the Lamb and Schmidt, but he said that there was a clear problem with the Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb believed that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt. However, the authorities reported on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triangle.
For seven years, Shawn O'Steen, married with Prentiss, described his wife as a human being.
A couple had resigned 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Su Heraldi, a close friend of Prentiss', Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home by hand.
Knowles said Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When the police arrived at Lampi Highway 1, near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the forest and took his life.
According to a CV on the University's website, Lamb received his doctorate in educational science at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Descending stars
The last few years have been heavy for an actor (with his left son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died from cancer.
The actor has also been fighting drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything has really taken place.
Manchester United on Luke Shaw's page for months for two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke against Manchester United Master's league against PSV Eindhoven.
The half-man is sorry to stay on the side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the airport for another season.
Shaw, a 20-year-old, was injured in the PSV defense area in the bad catch of Héctor Moreno, when the game was on for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be moved to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures on his leg, and he's in hospital care," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
A young person who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has had a hard time and is now injured after a great playoff.
In the suit, Shaw was given oxygen.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks in two places, he's on the side for half a month and he's not playing in the block phase anymore.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed a little off when the situation did not follow the penalty of the red card.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Galal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You may conclude on your own, but I think the situation was worth the penalty shot and the red card.
It was a two-legged tactics."
Shaw said, "Thank you all for your messages, and I can't tell you how much I'm upset, and I'm starting to get back from this, and I'm getting stronger."

The British defender has a special reason to recover from the competition in the European Championship in France in June.
"There is a very bad injury," said PSV coach.
"In these injury situations, all parties are always very sorry.
The goal of the players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his leg while playing in Mexico, with Van Galal's trust in the Netherlands not only in the 2014 World Championship.
"He is very sorry, for his intention was not to harm the opponent. It is unfortunate to hear that the injury is serious", Cocu said.
"Here I didn't see the situation.
I only saw the ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) was related to the ball, but I didn't see Luke's coat."
"I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"I feel really bad, I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Each parent notices before long that the child learns his favorite book nearly externally.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story for Dr. Seuss, which was published in 1971.
In the text published on the SuperCamp website Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The treasure is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I am happy to read it to my children, because there is always a picture or message that we have not noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to supplement the short text.
"In the city where the right trees and plants have been lost and even the air has a commodity, a son lives by the name of Ted who wants to get his dreams to the heart of a girl Audrey through this greatest dream: to see the right tree", the text says. In 1991 Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, the version of Ted had no crush.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tartu, where everything is artificial and even air is commercial goods, a boy lives by the name of Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dreams girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so foreign to him. Ahne Kerskanen will dispose of the wood and make them the necessary names draw despite Lorax’s opposition. Lorax is a small and thick, bright creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that this kind of task of a little pr has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently a person who, as a child, has not read Lorax 20 times in a tube.
The Prime Minister said that the text was probably from Cameron's Electoral Office.
SuperCamps did not comment more specifically on this but confirmed that the text was from Cameron's staff's manual.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the British team, but it's still tough.
Pakistan's encounter in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but once we see the last 3-0 loss of the British tour, it is not expected to happen.
I wouldn't shut down the opportunity to pay a guest profit.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than a three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences for 2012, only for a youthful positive.
As a guest, Moeen Ali develops as a tour player, and Adil Rashid, although he has no experience at the Test level, represents the attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, the decision to leave Adam Lyth away is hard for me to understand as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and simple and cruel truth is that critics are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best voters.
A few 50-point matches should have been held by Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he did not as well as he could, which did not surprise me.
The question of how long a Test shot can make an impact is difficult.
Lyth received seven land matches — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest games.
The only topic of complaint is perhaps that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in peak shape — but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's a hitter, which I value to a high level.
He's an unknown factor in the critics we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
In the air, the idea is that Moeeen will start a shootout with Cook, making an extra spinner in the game while four fast-eaters are held, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see any barrier to the fact that the top feeder could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great critic.
Moeen may not have had much time in her local team at Worcestershire, but she has been a team three player, and that is not a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test games as the first replacement player before he could start in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup hunter, and on the basis of what I've seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 players – and this can be a search engine, but very many of the players have not shown themselves ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this game trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a few smart choices in its training staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan striker, M chain Jayawarden, as an adviser to the Test matches may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most vulnerable men in the species, who brings with them much experience, because he has played against all kinds of circumstances and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the White Ball section of the game trip and brings both energy and mercy.
I think he has always influenced the right international criticism, whether his role as a player or coach, and, like Mahela, he has the intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a spray spray.
Collyn's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's match, Root has had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaching and electors do not set the match schedule.
And it should be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for maintaining Britain in the EU is in a deeper vein every day, even without a pleasant Jeremy "yes or not" Corbynik's choice for the head of the Labour Party or TUC in a fiercely mocking Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyni and Nigel Faragsa.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU will be, although not all of them are doing their own, have been tired of the British self-evident agenda, which includes concessions and harmful changes to the Treaty which they do not really want.
At the annual TUC Congress in Brighton, it was decided that they would also not enjoy the EU if it undermines social security.
We could call it Dave and George's Self-Agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Federal Republic will hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, catch themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-value individuals, return home and tell you that they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be an ambitious British within the EU tent. "Do not leave us alone with France," Berlin says, and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we no longer care, whether we remain or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's sensible Chancellor of ally is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave a post before it falls apart, as it happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France, Français Holland, is facing a re-election or a successor's choice in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, once again in Spain, a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them driving around to help selfie-brets, who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it either, because most have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to throw in unprofitable comments on the style of the Scottish National Party in the United Kingdom’s 2017 National election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend proposes.
"The talks were organised as a matter of order," said Britain. "There was nothing left in his hand about the renegotiation negotiations."
The Europeans know how the British press will catch up and how the EU sceptical oligarch press is, just as Tony Benn did in the 1975 referendum, whose result was 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Someone may remember in a remote manner Boris Johnson, a strange Euro-opportunist, who became known as our 'EU direct banana correspondent' in Brussels at the beginning of the 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They include taxes circulating, phones hacking and apparent-dwelling housing, which own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about them as much as they were, but then he realized that when he's in a cage with a rough gorilla, he's got to turn the bananas into a spider so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Mr Miliband was even more blaite than Mr Blair in opposition to the referendum, and Blair agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when the French and Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum 2005, Blair was able to make a useful contribution.
The press never forgiven him.
But a nice Jeremy Corby who killed me kindly on the back on Westminster Monday, and I told him he had no more time to waste on me, and it could be a risk that he would adopt Neil Kinnock's media boyic strategy in the '80s, which was a mistake and is still a mistake.
It can take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, whom he was sitting on the BBC screen on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in the reformed EU.
Most of the people outside Ukipi and Tory are likely to be able to respond to this positively.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennit" Benn told us on radio and television this week when his inner Boy Scout tried not to admit that it was a bad bet from Corby to appoint the fugitive John McDonnell as Secretary of State.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father had difficulties on TV to be loyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU 'in all circumstances'. McDonnel did not say that to his colleagues in Corby and the under-room members in a private meeting on Monday night.
The desire for Corby to care about the wonder of the image must be remembered that he even touched me. The mailman is important in the 24/7 period, especially in the discipline of the social media, where paranoids and fraud are capable.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass in relation to the EU, which could see Labouri's support as self-evident in a referendum, as McDonnell has said.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
The experience of McDonnel and Corbyn from EU membership is compatible with the history of the island economy and against capitalism. The discussions no longer belong to the narrow circle of left-wing dissidents, for whom the idea of combining similarity is a key doctrine in the doctrineal interests.
In the case of NATO, there has also been an inconsistency, and Tom Watson is inconsistency in the fact that Corby is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats must try to clarify the matter to their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters, why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be unnecessary?
The United States has already been quite disappointed in the terrible military presentation of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the operation of the Tory Government. I was reminded of it on Monday during the British Influence Security Forum launch.
Experts are critical of the opinions of the British authorities on e-infrastructures
According to researchers, the claims made by a state-funded installation that smoking of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were the result of a meeting of 12 participants in the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence provided by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE described last month's report on "reversive and comprehensive monitoring of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the security of information and raised the links of some experts with the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet Medical Journal’s editorial adopted a "notable sound foundation" on which PHE’s main conclusion was based.
In addition, two researchers in the BMJ have considered whether the arguments were put in place for "fish or sand".
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medical European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE’s argument that "the current best estimate of electrical cigarettes is about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" should be based on detailed research results analysis and modelling.
The claim was drawn up in one 12-person meeting, which was convened for the development of a model based on multi-criteria detection analysis (MCDA), which was intended to bring together participants’ views on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the participants of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose previous independent research by the CEO has been financed by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, the Executive Director pointed out in the sustainable activity report that he supported the activities of BAT in the field of public health.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting granted funding from an electric acid producer, although the alleged previous financing of the tobacco company Philip Morris International did not.
The selection criteria for the panel’s composition have not been explained; however, there are several well-known beneficiaries of electrical assistance, some of which grant their involvement as an industrial financier.
However, some participants are not familiar with their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco opponent.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the Group's study report shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the adverseity of products, with a large proportion of products and their compliance with the criteria.
However, there are no links or shortcomings mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that electric cigarettes can promote smoking for children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare, arguments have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than conventional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of traditional tobacco; however, long-term effects need to be investigated more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and does not show, especially in situations where relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80 000 deaths per year related to smoking, and smoking costs public health care of £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current display that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but they are a fraction of the damage caused by traditional tobacco.
The BBC should give up East Eders, says Channel 4 bomb
Luke Johnson, who was led by Channel 4, said that BBC should stop sending certain programs, including East Eders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hands to hit-and-runs, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not done by other television stations.
He criticised the presentation of programmes that are likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as the large number of viewers of competitors, as well as, for example, the BBC4 channel.
When Tony Hall, CEO of BBC, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said for six years he was trying to get Channel 4 to cooperate with the BBC, with results.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC will buy formats and send programmes that would clearly be part of some competitive channel software", Johnson told the communication committee in Parliament's upper room, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to maintain a broadcasting fee, which I think may not be a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its supply to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC sends The Voice to its best viewing time because it wants the broadest possible support in the future.
If no other channel is concerned about the program, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without aid," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, East Eders, second, although it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand to it.
I don't understand how this serves the service offer of a public service company.
I don't think these would be losses to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. He believes that BBC is fighting for good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the most popular series in the BBC are similar to that of the former Sky-Pomon Tony Ball, which proposed in his MacTaggot lecture in 2003 that the BBC would sell out series like East Eders.
According to Johnson, the programmes for the NBC Niche General are shown on the BBC4 channel, where the viewers cannot be measured most often, but the programmes meet their purpose. "BBBC can say, in its defence of the hypocrisy of its mission, that it has made four billion pounds of broadcasts that no one considered special programs."
"BBC presents them as times when no one ever sees them."
Johnson said, "I'm going to find you another system of old age in that sense, who's getting the best.
Everyone, of course, thinks that 150 pounds a year is affordable, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if the BBC is not looking at much."
David Elstein, former head of the Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also told his views in committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should exchange its ancient missions with new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, there is hardly any program available in the current offer of the BBC – 1% on television and 0.1% on the radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from the public radio companies in Australia and Canada and go back to the new belief of his mission: "to know, illustrate and entertain".
In the question of cooperation, Elstein proposes that the BBC be able to increase shipments, for example, from events such as Proms Festival, which was sent last year only a fraction of concerts. "BBC should also join allied commercial channels so that full supply is also available online", he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle ceiling changes its direction when it is applied to ultrasounds.
Researchers have raised worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified and thus can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttle ponds change their direction when directed to an ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing area of the ear of man.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that are genetically modified with a transport film that reacts to the ultrasound.
Further information: Researchers follow brain activity by means of light
According to researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenesis).
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the California Salk Instute, La Jolla, told Guardian that one day the method can replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s symptoms, which stimulates the brain with electric pulses.
The shuttles do not normally react to the ultrasound. Chalasani found that the worms, however, start to react when placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the dome is powered by ultrasonic waves moving inside the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the worm cell membranes.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, sound waves will open these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To be able to control shuttles using ultrasonic Chalasani, the worms were genetically modified to form TRP4 ion channels from the nerve that guided their movement.
When ultrasonics were diverted to modified worms, microcircuits strengthened sound waves and moved to worms, resulting in a signal in the nerve cell.
The method resembles a bit of optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that enables researchers to activate nerve cells using light.
According to Chalasan, however, sonogenetics have certain advantages over optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brain under investigation by means of photofibres. Low frequency ultrasounds, however, pass through the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be diverted to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and viral therapy can induce human nerve cells to be temporarily exposed to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in the clinical setting," Chalasani stated.
According to the investigator, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Unlawful torture devices — at your door!
Advertising is a disgrace to British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's anti-arming video.
Creepy killer threats!
Neck-breaking leg irons!
Ryebombs!
Remote ventilators that cause intolerable pain but don't leave a trail!
The happy voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertising of the world's largest arms fair is a parade. The video is produced by Amnesty International, and it is intended to highlight the British administration's attempt to sell weapons to the repression governments at the DSEI (Deefence Security and Equipment International), which is held at the ExCel Fair in London's Docklands.
Further information: DSEI stations: autonomous governments arriving in London
There are also posters for bus stops and subways, which require another blinking.
"The important announcement: are you moving by metro from 15 to 18 September?" The announcement reminds me of London's metro announcements of its appearance. The photo of the tanker is on the other side of the subway.
"In September, a number of arms dealers arrive in Dockland, and customers are asked to help stop the arms fair."
Three hundred posters have been performed by artists whose work was performed by Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruise Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution of posters around London with a six-mind "a advertising space hacking package" with hexagonal keys, which claim to have access to about one-third of the world's bus stop advertising posters.
Transport for London is not a posteralism laugh.
One of the pillars of the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Curator of Cruel Designs and Professor Gavin Grindon of Essex University, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the gallery.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world, and many are moving to work with Protestant activists.
Another anti- Arms trade posters greeted public transport users in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over 100,000 times per day. It has been designed without compensation from the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the reporter have also done their work without compensation.
The artistic director of VCCP Matt Lever failed the absence of the messumino and an empty point in ExCeL's event calendar. He said, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried a more realistic, vague corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention."
"They've done a great job and helped us to raise the fairs that practice illegal torture," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally at our door."
However, there may be the most creative antiquity in the exhibition halls in ExCeL, where the exhibitors take advantage of huge circular expressions of their goods.
In his press release, Saab announced the U.S. Army's order for "sufficient AT4CS RS".
The product includes "a special-shaped battle cart that is effectively penetrated directly to the target."
That doesn't sound pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in student housing
I moved to the student dormitory 11 years ago, and I was innocent 19 years old, and I still believed in barettes and moral relativism.
The most important teachings I can sum up in eight simple rules.
The transition to the dwelling is at its least a straining experience and, at its worst, a shocking experience.
You're starting to wonder: you tell everyone where you are, do you like mid-years and why you like Corbyn and why you don't "rightly hate or love Marmite, because it's just a yeast, hahahahaha, I'm in my room".
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask others questions.
Questioning leads the conversation and helps you to find the people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your eyelashes were on display and these people would be sharing extinguishers.
Give the others room.
Own rooms often operate as drink counters, cinematology and general housing facilities, but their own room is also a place where you dress up, starting with underwear.
More about: Don’t even think about combining dating and university studies
Introverte University is a tough place
The room should be a place for calming down. However, many residential houses form a social culture that moves from one room to another and forms life-long friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so I can download back the energy I used to date you."
Try to see if any of your study friends are exhausted from social contact, perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my own student apartment there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant that he was welcome in.
She saw everything.
Make friends by making bread.
You start your studies properly when you're in, so if you're making brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-century, a little strange, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've been making some bread for you.
Homemade peas are a great way to make new friends.
Your study friend is forced to talk to you, and thanks to a good surprise, they may have a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable pastry.
If you're serving miserable flour, sugar and fat, others are probably pretending to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Cooking is also a common failure in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you make it fall out of another milk can?
Always make sure it's from the owner of the milk cans.
I'm sure you'll get permission, even if the loan of milk would make a lot of money for the owner.
I understand well that it is annoying for someone to think of something about you, but try to deal with the situation as grown up as possible — unlike my study friend, who gave her milk detergent a punishment to milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make noise when everyone else tries to sleep or jump.
It's not just because it's polite, it's worth remembering that every other hole is digging...
In my own apartment house, a girl asked a living room next door to adjust music to a smaller place, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I was finally quiet in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she left for three hours for the exam, left music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse moved to the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you thought that your study friend would be your husband first, that you would start dating, resign and see him every day and lose your mutual friend's right to meet him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, and if the study friend is definitely not the only one that's right, try to control it.
If you find in a DUI that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door has not been locked, the limit of tricking and bullying is worse than you could think.
Well, that's a good joke, but one that's gonna be okay in a minute.
Hideing some object may be valuable and fun teaching, but no room should be confused with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door of the other room can be locked and dropped in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but do not attach any of the items to the ceiling with a blue guitar more than a few times.
The racist attack on Kite at the home of foreign students - The house designed as a reception center was smuggled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made at the home of foreign students in Kite, North Karelia.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not accommodation facilities for minors, but sleep facilities for foreign students who have already been in Finland, says Heidi Luukkanen, teacher of the Evangelical Institute of Kiev.
The windows and walls of the public school’s accommodation facilities were carved with racist signs, such as hares, and a metal object had been thrown through a window in one of the accommodation rooms, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkanen, the building targeted by violence was estimated at 10 people during the attack.
"There was a weekend and grown-up people are free to move, so some may have been elsewhere," says Luukkainen.
The National College has a housed population of 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as newly arrived minors.
All those who are involved in the building have a-stations.
Part of the study is adult education, part is vocational studies and part is studying Finnish", Luke explains.
A status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for a period of four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigates the attack as an injury and a violation of home peace.
A press conference was held on Monday, which included the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and nobody wanted to leave.
We have had 20 years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens," says Luukkainen.
The lock says the mess's already been cleaned out of the wall.
At least three men were suspected of being made, and they had been on the move by a light passenger car.
I think this is the end of the Youth weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
It's nothing more serious," says Luukkainen.
Salo also has a hospital designed for reception facilities.
It happened last week.
She told me about it on her website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was surrounded by a hammer and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a criminal report to the police.
Specification 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y-jun for the pack - passengers in their chewing hands, "Old idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepor, Karya, will cease to run in March.
The news made it difficult for passengers to get to the beginning of the train at Helsinki Main Railway Station.
In particular, the submerged river strikes the siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström, the municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time, and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be against anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says that an interview video of HSTV is coming with a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in New Zealand.
H-and R-rail trains are connected to a new R-line.
The station of Purola in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be left out of service.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced information on the routes to buy train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will vary at the turn of the year and the route to be terminated will be throughout the country.
A new four-year agreement finalising in autumn will be adopted later by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, Siuntiolainen, considers that the State train cutlery is a short-term activity.
We make the same mistakes that have been made earlier and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be regret.
Y trains are also used by non-Raaseporians and Siunthios, as it is quick and overcoming several stations.
On the train, Annina Pöyry, Espoo, was upset by the fate of those who traveled further from the city area.
"It is especially bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said in his pain on the Y train.
A little relief is allowed.
There must be a new train connection on the beach that will replace the Y-jun in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. to Kirkkonummi.
This brings additional costs to HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, Executive Director of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate costs.
It says that according to the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million years of the Y train, the Ministry of Justice of course much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves two positions behind.
Instead, the number of train shifts is doubled in Ainola and Saunakallio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from the roads of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Siinajoki.
The Pieksämämäki-Joensu route is shortened to the route Pieksämämäki-Varkus.
The trains are reduced on the routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are carried out on the basis of a total of around nine million journeys purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to provide the State with 12,3 million annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in the book “Marxin is worth studying”
The global economic crises have led Karl Marx to the surface (1818-1883) and his final report, published in 1867-1894, to Finland, to write the current state of Marx's capital, known as the former president of GDP, Yrjö Hakane.
"He is now being taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his first speech.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy in all areas of life increasingly, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazing.
You can also find Aalto University professor, a highly respected economist, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx is a topical "forever and ever".
But isn't the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and Economics' delegation Marxian?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not think Marx is a timely economicist but rather an interesting social theoryist.
Today, social sciences are isolated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociology, economist, journalist, political agitator and lessons of literature.
"The idea is that the architect tells of the wrong opinions of the dead men," Korkman starts.
It's true that Marx's predictions went awfully wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early magic of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most important thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now again discussing Marxin's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that changes as a result of a technical upheaval", Korkman's analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help from Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Marx is in favour of getting acquainted with Korkman.
"In the '70s Marx couldn't read", Korkman says.
"The Mao and the Trotskians and the other sects hated all capitalism, but even more one another."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weightings of the hives.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mind world, like the other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations is calling for war criminals in Sri Lanka
The United Nations calls for a special court to investigate the war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as the Matilists.
The civil war in Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the massive attack of the armed forces in the last months of the war should be examined properly in 2009, the UN report calls for.
The report on Sri Lanka's armed forces blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual assault, which was as likely as male and female victims.
According to the report, the rebels have been forced to force their siders and children into fighters.
According to the report, both sides have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it was going to organise the investigation itself, but it does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
The English yo test allowed the social media to be weighed
On Wednesday, New York, there was a long foreign language, which was English for most of it.
More than 16,000 pilots tested their English skills.
It could have been a social media test.
Based on their own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150-250 words in English could show the editor of the journal’s board of counseling.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for Finnish Leelia rest chairs.
He had to ask him how parents would be able to look at things from the point of view of young people.
In total, there were four subjects, one of which was to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," evaluated the third topic of Porvoo Swedish High School in English journalist Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was merely a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was very nice.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least at our school we've been trained to write our speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment as "which is normal".
In Finnish or Swedish - the English test, questions were answered about texts that contained, for example, the adaptation of the summer balconies to climate change and the handling of large amounts of information.
Some long Russian (68 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, with another native, Swedish, or Finnish experience in turn.
In high schools, the test is normally organised, that is, the expression of the employees does not affect it.
The University Board calls for pilots to search for suitable transport connections in time to reach the trial event.
A further period may also be obtained if you can demonstrate that your lateness was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, the store was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu, Wednesday morning, the store was robbed in the City of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper had been dressed in dark clothes and a commando who covered his face.
A man is normal and is about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the crew with a hand gun and received a small amount of money.
They're looking into this as a gross robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
A mental expression against government cuts will be blocked at Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting police.
According to preliminary information, there may be up to tens of thousands of people arriving.
Members of the SAK, Akaksen and STKC alliances will meet at the Rautatientor at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in demonstrations.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarms and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the giant alarm.
The roads leading to the railway corridor shall be closed from motor vehicles for the period from 9.30 a.m. to 14.
Only alarm vehicles will be allowed to enter the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, the traffic is cut off from the traffic circle of Kaisaniemi, from the direction west of Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it looks like enough.
I'm not taking a position on the police work fights.
According to Helsinki, Helsinki is coming from other Finland due to mental expression.
The police don't tell the exact patroller.
"Sometimes it's coming, but basically we'll be fine with our own," says Kujala.
The police are asking to avoid private car rides in central Helsinki on Friday.
The alley estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to early afternoon.
There are also a lot of subscription buses coming from Finland with protesters arriving from elsewhere.
They won't be released to the Railways.
The buses are going to be a long way from now.
The rest of the trip will then have to walk to the point of demonstration," Kujala says.
The spirit expression also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at these large gatherings of people, is now partly self-handling.
The organisers of the media have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mental expression to go smoothly.
People are ordinary unemployed or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
There are also local demonstrations taking place across Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstrations are in many ways exceptional - do you remember these laws and demonstrations?
In many ways, the great demonstrations organised by the trade unions on Friday are interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Emeritus Martti Siisiinen, professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't do that, it would raise your hands in front of the government," Sisinen says.
A well-righteous government has hit the cores of the tradition of Finnish corporateism - and also points that have been important to the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard records are missing in the contract law.
Here are a lot of features that are really trying to get the Ay movement to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look at the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have all employees' support for Friday's demonstrations.
The new one is now the steep division which is brought about by the spirit expression of which the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstrations.
The unemployed gathered from across Finland showed their views at the Parliamentary Hall in November 1993.
If you're looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstrations, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostor, the 1993 Murrostors, says Siisiinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorsta collected 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (centres) government was colliding from the labour market crisis to the second.
It was said that the differences between the Finnish government and the employees' organisations were never as bad as they were during the Aho porvary regime.
Now the range between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than during the time of the Murrostorst.
In addition, there is now a Finland’s very poor bourgeois government, says Siisiinen.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is such a strict right despite the Finnish talk.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time.
Several thousand protestors are expected to be present on Friday.
The spirit expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day care as well as schools.
Although the expression does not receive the undistributed support of the employees, it can become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, about 300 demonstrations have been held annually in recent years.
They're all over the top.
Traditionally, Finnish protests of ay movement have been quite peaceful - although the practice has been hard in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict; they are law-abiding.
Prosecutors strive to avoid damage or destruction of property, Sisinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of interest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw chicken eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The fireman strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes, among other things, by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these sheets and demonstrations?
The 1970s metal and electric shocks
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power and electricity strike in 1977.
The metal men's strike involved 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended on the proposal of the Reconciliation Board for seven weeks.
Metal men got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused hives all over the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people met on behalf of the Parliamentary House, many of which made the recession unemployed, to express their opinion on the work.
Firemen stopped for three months in 1998.
The fireman strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were subjected to egg fever in protests against farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops", was one of the slogans.
Espala's farmers were snoring snow by tons.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn hays in front of the meeting site.
Depositors closed in 1983 and 1995
For about a month, nurses ceased to exist in 1995.
For the last time, they had been in strike in 1983.
Some deaths occurred during the strike in 1995.
The operation threatened the strike and the mass transplantation of nurses in 2007.
In the end, it was the result of the talks that led to the threat of mass isolation.
Doctors closed in 2001
"The doctors in the strike - from the escape", was part of the strike of the smuggled doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centres and hospitals lasted five months and led to a lively debate on the possible risks to patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
About 5 000 students marching for study support from the Senate to the Parliamentary Hall in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Crime Police will find out about the backgrounds of the Finnish border with the Austrian police.
The Austrian police has asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in resolving the backgrounds of the refugee regime registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped Aisterheim near the border of Germany on a truck with 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
They were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and primary responsibility are located in Austria, explains Commissioner Tero Haapala of Central Crime Police.
At the end of the lifetime, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to the General Radio, the truck belongs to the Finnish limited company.
The company is engaged in restaurant activities, for example, and its CEO is a foreign-style man, about 40 years old.
Two Irakilaisms have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
A refugee farting captain, a former drug addict and a high-level businessman, the story of five smugglers.
Uploric smuggler king, violent boatboy, a stylish missionary, and himself a good guy cab driver.
For example, such people engage in trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, working at Trento University, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their book Death Travel Office is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the plots of trafficking in human beings, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different stairs of business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
On the eastern coast of Tunisia, the islands of Kerkenna do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for a summer visit.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also perfectly suitable for smuggled transport, as the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives in a chain of burning captains and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for fishermen to carry people.
This is what Emir has done with its blue, ten - foot - long wooden veins hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full of feathers, 40 people can fit it.
One trip Emir makes about 8 000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for her clients around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunnes wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again as a result of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna island in small groups.
Emir will stay in empty houses for as long as he can see good.
Food is given so that customers are just going to survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going to go out in the middle of the night, in a mild place.
The first night, you drive off the island, then stop it, wait a day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is heavy, and passengers are crying and vomiting in waves of 20 metres high.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been landed within half an hour and Emir is on the way back.
Emir wants people to fear him.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least he claims to beat the players to death.
He says in the book that once the police jumped him, he threw all his passengers over the side of the ship and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I picked up customers on one neck and threw them over the top," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come south of the Sahara.
He says he's going to have to abuse this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
It's a normal cab ride.
Goran is the usual cab driver in Bogovasha, Serbia.
His cab's not very good at the starter engine, and anyway, he's seen the best of his days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving across and moving towards Hungary's border.
Bogovasha is about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch in 500 inhabitants.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly released.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their families are located in tents, ceilings and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
Also, families living in the forest who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for a reason or another.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Gora finds most of his clients.
These are often stolen exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings of borders and weeks of walking trips in difficult rural areas, often mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the Bogovasha area, in the knots of the great trafficking of human beings, people are dead.
Goran's cytins are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis, and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he'll tell you in the book.
"They say their business once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to do it.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
That's bullshit all the way.
First the price is agreed at 300 euros, for example, then they fall to 200 and finally offer 150 euros.
Goran points out that he's a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he is working cheaper than others, and that he can spend only EUR 50 per person on the Hungarian border.
It's a three-mile drive, most of it's comfortable on the highway.
My colleagues say they're asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a big deal for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice year's return in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be transported more than 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rides a mile away from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and shakes off.
The Work of Loneliness
A 35-year-old Congoleseman is called a missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
He truly has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where there are many believers who have fled from Congo, as well as a small center to help the Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Ambassador runs the smuggling business, where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber strip of white larvae is stylishly strangled under the low waist of the jeans.
A missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the client calls from one of the five telephone numbers of the Ambassador.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money from the visor and pass the border among the traders.
In order to obtain asylum seekers or refugee status, the Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have been forced to flee their homes from violence.
Often it's true, but if not, the Ambassador will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old ID card will be destroyed and another ID will be acquired.
That's where the Ambassador's contacts in Uganda's police will help.
The customer is then directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, the NGOs, finally the UN refugee organisation UNHCR.
The missionary feels bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He will pay about a hundred euros to apply to the Ugandan police, about 150 documents to the humanitarian organisation, and a process of migration to, for example, a European country of EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice-cream
Tom's a starter smuggler, former drug addict.
A four-year-old Irish is on the coast of France, calling on Calais, where his job is to deliver people to trucks on the way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French cab and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know they are in human secret transport business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from some people in the center of Calais.
They're driving A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go directly to prison to organise illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting here for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs across the freeway of his customers to the rest of the place where the drivers sleep before they continue to cross the canal across the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it's on its way to England, not even Holland, and cut through the protective cover.
It's gotta be done quietly, so they don't wake up the driver.
Sometimes the driver's on the run, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wrapped his client in aluminium foil, the same thing that is being wrapped around a roast or oven in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police heat scanner from finding out who's hiding.
Some use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping he doesn't drive suddenly before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous humanists.
In Uporical Turkish has been called champion of marketing and undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean lands, who controls maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only requires money.
One of the new methods is the luxury shipwreck: Turkish ports are rented with pleasure bars to bring American or European families to tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, ships are loaded on a sample of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which are first transported from Istanbul to a port and sea to Europe against a charge of EUR 5 000-7 000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until they are ready to leave.
People are closed to minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When given, the ship must be boarded quickly.
Passengers must keep their distance below deck hidden.
The Marine Guard can only observe the depth of the ship swimming, as no other sign of the human population is visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers are expelled and vomited, the better.
Küçük receives about 53 000 euros for one luxury ship after the expenses.
He does not do practical things himself, but employs captains, recruiters, guards, reptiles and other smaller factors to do the work for him.
During the summer, there will be at least hundreds of transports and millions will be made by Kéçük.
He is estimated to have bought over 100 apartments through cover companies in the country, a pharmaceutical company, and he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Since then, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10 a.m.: The Death Travel Office book will be published here, not next week.
American Olympics reports in their book about their illness and their becoming a prostitute
Three times at the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton reports in his book about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published bitter books on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at Sydney Olympics.
He got into a race in top order and ran for the second time.
But in the final, he was panicking.
He immediately attacked the top at the beginning and defended his leadership on a manic run.
Yet, 150 meters before the paint, his powers were strengthened.
He fell into the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I packed myself over the line of goals, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton was suffering from two-way mental disorder.
His brother Dan had done a year before Sydney's races committed suicide, and he himself felt tremendous success pressure.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There were no financial problems in Paris, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money to have sex with other men.
He also overdosed with his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He tells me he spent money in his luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of becoming a prostitute was also that he needed similar adrenaline ticks as he had been competing in public sports.
Later on, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star drinker came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was at 1500 metres in the world’s statistical cycle of 3.57.40, but remained last in Sydney’s Olympicfine.
The world champion was glad to see the alliance strangled the Norwegian ski resort:
The Norwegian skiing queen Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of conformity in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the sports agreement throughout the summer and autumn, like last year.
Even though the Union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for the multi-time world champion and the Olympic winner.
As a result of the treaty conflict, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the future World Cup.
The decision received thanks from the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance had taken the skis out of him.
"Thank you for showing me the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow an active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently wants to be part of the season of the country team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that also takes care of future generations and does not give up one athlete in the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union had given Northug both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different rule than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own announcement in which he convinced him that he wanted to be brave in Norway's colours next season in the world Cup, as well as in the MMs and the Olympics.
With her career, Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MMs, of which two gold medals.
He was in Falun last winter with a team who won a communication cult.
The shielding date of the patent translators will also be celebrated in the North Pole.
On the day of the race, 25.9., campaigns are held in different restaurants and shops, which have been issued a shield from the Paistin translators.
The aim of today is to highlight Finland's high-quality food sector skills and to lower the threshold for entering the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of its high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but there are top restaurants controlled and classified by an impartial operator around Finland.
The international attention received is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the sensitivity of the thyroid glands and the organization.
In the North Pole, the day is held at the restaurant in Vaasa, Fondinen and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the turtle day participates in the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events to be held in the same day around the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Long-distance newspaper: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of a district reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhavan ex-space currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region remains permanently located in critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Erillisverkot Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building set would constitute a significant risk of safety, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, defence forces may have interests in the area of the former Airport School and the airport, the effect of which has not also been clarified when preparing the reception centre, writes.
The report states that for the last two years there have been negotiations on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, inter alia, with Mr Jussi Niinistö (ps) and with Mr Arto Rädy, Head of the Ministry of Defence.
The private person points out to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a question of fundamental opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned location in the former equipment area is wrong.
Last Monday, the City Government of Kauhava dealt with the reception centre.
Ninth: The situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The government means that immigrants and those here will have the necessary conditions, the Niinistö commented on the suppliers in the evening after meeting the Presidents of all the Parliamentary Party in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about managing the refugee situation were shared among all the participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the fundamental issues.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to the Niinistung, the situation in Syria and the situation in Russia and the United States can also have an impact on Ukraine and the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistna is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Niinistö, the NATO question was also mentioned in the discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Media researcher: Sipil take a big risk
According to the Sipil, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio speeches are one of the other channels.
A channel of this kind of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, but Sipilä said to the journalists in the Parliament.
The wing did not want to assess the frequent way the Prime Minister will make television and radio calls.
According to the wing, talks may not always be conveyed in the future by Ylen channels.
If other channels report as channels, we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to the Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio talk to citizens.
This whole matter, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipila figured it out.
The speech will be sent from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
The wings take a big risk
The media investigator hopes that Sipilä's TV talk will not tell us more about the in-house transformation of the government.
Is it an attempt to take greater control of the right to define public debate and refuse public debate on the issues raised by the University of Stockholm's professor Anu Koivunen?
The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin recently commented that he did not follow the media agenda and let it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things will not be linked.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media has been heartened by the announcement of Sipilä.
It'd be weird if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not about reporting issues in democracy.
It is up to the media to have a definition of not taking up politicians' agents.
According to Koivuinen, the TV speech is a big risk to Sipila.
In his speech, the wing should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations of the speech are fulfilled.
Is there more of what we've heard today?
Or is he able to talk to a different person in a different way or in a different way or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only an increase in the same old one, we must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In particular, there is a risk in this respect if it is not a particular situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is identified as a medium for politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle's interest or general line.
A wingy bet
In the forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister does not say is important.
Tonight, we have to look carefully at where Sipil is missing and not where, says research coordinator Heikki Kuutti, Jyväskylä University.
According to the moon, the TV speech is a smart bet from Sipil, because this is the way to bring forward its own views without a sound of oppression.
This will enable the general public to do so without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The chip will pass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, it is a risk that the media is wrong to interpret the speech because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä is on TV, whether sweats, shaking hands.
He compares Sipila to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to do his thing well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government informs you about something, because it is a person who speaks directly to another person.
This is what Obama and the partners regularly do.
It's really extraordinary.
Commissioner Erkka Railo, who is a politician, considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
The exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants Finns to be sane about the challenges ahead.
On Friday, wage organisations organise demonstrations and strike against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the left-wing movement, says on Twitter that Sipilä could speak about the status of the nation as the Prime Minister's announcement, which would allow us to discuss the speech as well.
Mr Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces his challenge for Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologs.
It'll be six months from the election.
You can't hide from the finals, Rinne writes on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
THE boy's father updated his Facebook pages.
The Home Finland Police Department will also confirm the matter to the evening press.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later this evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks all those people who help us find him.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was divided closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent bullying of young people: You are making anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a sad-looking freelancer, published a video on Facebook, which calls in particular on immigrant backgrounds for young people.
Mr Amirkhani held a strong speech against young street fighting.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving at Finland at five years of age with his family, has now won both his professional match in the most prestigious UFC series in the free match.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
There are video downloads on the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed with the wilding of young people.
Amirkhan, a 26-year-old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick on the ground, sit on the other, and play blindly without thinking about any of these consequences, what happens when you make videos like this, Amirkani updates.
It's hard to defend.
Some of the young people displayed on video are migrant backgrounds.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, the fight video has been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and Finnish young people.
That's exactly the fact that you're fighting across the street.
You are doing so much more difficult in the lives of so many other immigrants here in Finland, Turkish Amirkhani reminds you.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite gross.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be a long time guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If sometimes they become the target of someone's racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go with that kind of guy.
Amirkhani says that violent activity gives rise to racism.
You're making me hate that I don't like myself.
You're going to have a pretty bad situation, and you're not going to get any better than that, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, SAK President Lauri Lyly says that the employees' organisation will consider its position on Monday to present an alternative list of savings.
Laurie Lyly commented on the STKT's proposal on Twitter.
earlier on Wednesday, the Staff Centre Organisation (STKC) informed the Government of its own proposal to achieve the 5 % productivity cut requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
The current Chairman, Mr Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STKK and the Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, this would require that the largest wage earner organisation, the SAK, soften its position.
SAK President Lauri Lyly, for his part, commented slightly on this issue on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lylyn, the SAK is looking for solutions to open up the labour market, and there is a need for agreements between the active parties on the position of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Government of Prime Minister Sipilä for a social agreement did not qualify for the SAK.
In the past, the Sipila broke the negotiations on the social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5 % profit margin.
Comment: There's a danger of a big smile - "It's a bit funny to put on a fist"
It's a bit funny to put on a fist, if there's already a pekka tiinane in the pocket, write Pekka Tiinane.
The moods vary from person to person in the wage camp to person.
Is it supposed to call off the government, or is it settled?
On Monday, SAK's federal leaders were smuggled in holy hatred against the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut it down.
The cloud even spread to the wretched ones.
OAJ, a teacher's trade union, threatened to close schools and day care centres.
Tuesday, the OAJ withdrew: no school or day-care centres will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) president of the STKC Staff Centre Organization took an agreement.
He said that he had contacted the government and that he had prepared an alternative proposal by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) for a 5 % profit cut.
The current president, Mr. Sture Fjäder, was rushing to announce immediately that his document was ready.
At first, the SAK's office didn't belong in the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just Monday told the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAC bureau will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAC will seek solutions for the opening of the labour market gap.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAC should tend to accept a 5 % profit cut as a target.
There is no wonder that Palola STKT has relations with Sipila’s government in order.
The right hand of Palola, the head of STKC’s social failure, Jukka Poisus, previously served as special assistant to the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanaksen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described that ay-skilling of the government has been improving all the time.
Incidental or not, but Palola's exit took a bit off from the Finnish stationers, whose figure was excavated by the ACP-Marko Piulainen (sd).
I'm sure it's kind of funny to put on a fist, if there's already a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This cannot happen again"
Mr Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian duuman, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to the Russian duum President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is a better Etyj father than Finland.
In Ula Bator, the main city of Mongolia has started the meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Festival.
In that case, Finland did not allow the arrival at the meeting of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced by the European Union - a matter on which the President mentioned journalists.
According to our estimates, it was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't happen again, so Naryshkin stressed according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was directed at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The Sanctians are political suicides from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
So Naryshkin continued to squeal Finland by congratulating and thanking Mongolia for its "special organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that Parliamentary dialogue does not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed Russia's delegation.
The lock meets the real Playoff mirror: "Mals on tight"
The killer and the Snow will continue today in Hakamets' bully days when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today at Hakamassa, there will be no actual goal party.
The killer came to Kuopio last night to fake a 3-2-way victory from KalPa.
The rise was a manly thing, for last season's silver team was at its worst two goals of defeat.
The lock on Tuesday was more molli-winner.
The Chinese catch-started Blues' guest was a round zero point, and the losing figures were also two to three.
Hard game, goals on tight, if any play similar to last year's, Lock-up Janne Lahti foresees settings on the side of the club.
The killer has become quite a Playoff nightmare for the Roma.
In the last two years, the killer has just dropped off from the final series of Lukko.
Both layers require a crucial seventh match.
During the last season, the Lock took the show out in the fourth game, but Tappara got up on three next side and over.
There are no major changes in group configurations except for paint foams.
The two guys who rejected them last night are gonna get a big shift today.
With the kill best paint Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the lock-up pins Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
View angle: Bad play going on in the ace
Toivola, Director of Sports, wrote the inappropriate extension of Chief Coach Rautakallio, writes from Santtu Silvennoinen Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie where he himself played the main part.
The substantiator sensationally put a heavyweight series on the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost a title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a non-violent ash story in Pori.
Unnamed and tree-created son of a bitch moved to everyone's surprise for the SM-final in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous guys like Rocky, but tough underpants.
There were white Indians, Pori Matti and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, players dyed their heads red and cut the Irish.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The cops took the defeated silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The author hopes that the novel of this season works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man working as director of an open sports operation has built a pagan for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Granton have been rotting waste in the neck like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are out of play somewhere other than kiekoli.
Hope has forgotten that Rocky VI plays the main part of Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has been baptized at the Sean Connery of Rautakallion.
Rautakallio is a writer at London, Rocky, who is as squeaky as the main performer as Connery would have been in the original book of 1976.
There's nothing left in the Iron Rocky except the nickname.
The philosophy of the iron wave is not a matter of rushing and a little biting.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's different to play hard as a pig.
Last season, the Aussie Garrett Stafford was in the back of Tappar's Jere Karjalainen head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Ironhall put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have people who deserve to play.
I don't accept that kind of game, and it's not part of the bush, and after the game, I'm not sure if it's hot, I'm just gonna go to the nation of Satakunta.
The Open Team of this season has been strangely built.
There's trains, veterans, cops, and targets.
There are virtually no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The recent period's events affect procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, and Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
I'm going down the road.
The 1953 Rautakallio model is well-knownly interested in moving to Hope as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The public balance in the three leagues of the season has just as many losses with the difference in goal of 1-6.
Tolola wouldn't have supported the script extension part.
Olga Temone plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband as Tuuka's teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's guidance.
Yeah, I'm doing my husband's friend's mom in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actor and a producer Olga Temone laughs.
He has been married to Apulannan ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The couple have worked together a lot before, but now Olga is acting under Tuuka's guidance for the first time.
I've played a role in helping you in the beautiful film about us in the early years of the year. The rubble Sipe Santapuki's mother Sirkka.
The sirkka semppa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (who plays Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I learnt about my true example in Sirka, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in this role.
Olga had already met Sirkan before the film project, but since then the twins have come close.
They've met, talked on the phone, communicated.
The sirkka has done so much to help.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
And luckily, sirkka realizes that drama is drama, and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Helpland would become the largest band in Finland.
In the late '90s, it was flat and really intense.
There was a pretty small probability that someone really could, but Sirka had some kind of inspiration, and she was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot from Tuukka since she was young before film plans.
However, the parents’ stories have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s evil sketter.
Olga was a common and nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At most, he could've secretly been in love.
According to Olga, during the 10 years she has worked so much with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been a very good thing.
Now the whole production team is going to go to Heinola for a month.
However, because of their small children, a couple living in the East is often going to drive home at night, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take Heinola for a month.
They have accepted us warmly, only asked which streets and when to be emptyed.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland's most expensive drama movie
The budget for the Iron Sky, led by Timo Vuorensola: The Cosing Race, is EUR 17 million.
The shoots start in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifiefilm Iron Sky's extension, Iron Sky: The Cosing Race, will rise to the most expensive play film ever in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
The title of the most expensive Finnish film has been at the Jalmar Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation that is being made is also rising by the Iron Sky 2 as the film's budget is over EUR 100 million.
In October, photos of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begin at the AED Studios, near Antwerp, and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I've been sick and relaxed!
I've got such a casual file script because I know exactly what kind of movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, and he's gonna tell the evening magazine.
Initially, 8-10 million were designed as a film budget, but as the script developed, the budget grew.
The budget's big, but there's a big story too.
However, 100 million people should become involved in the film, because each angle and effects are so expensive.
Now everything has been bent so tight, there's no finding at all.
Today, Iron Sky Universe, a film production company, launched a public finance campaign and a public loan, with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and offer during the campaign.
At least two years later, the company will pay back the loan.
Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov play in the film.
Train or cool?
Big logos coming back to the shirts
The breasts of trends have recently been cleaned by large logos.
Still some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs in a cognac.
The advertising of the mark of the hood or t-shirt was seen somewhat as a train.
It's the times that change.
Sport has become the right megatrend of fashion, and so are the old, familiar sports characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness waver.
And, like so often before, the funny and trendy limit is disgusting: if something's already got a good one, it's starting to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm Core, that is, a tavismu, where trends were surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes as a means of separating themselves from mass.
Now, instead of the grey basic collection, we're gonna put on the vervain buried at the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer's logo is in front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas, for example, has identified track curtainrs, favorite team gaming shirts, and New York Yankees flags have made their way back into street fashion.
The start of the stores' edge is to mock the Alternate Calvin Klein logos are now cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from sports tags to luxury brands.
For example, the breast of Versace’s corset makes clear what character of the clothing it is.
Would you be willing to introduce the logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I didn’t get stuck for hours in the tank’s hatch!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagili, where Russia's Arms Expo 2015.
In recent days, there have been colorful claims on the Russian media that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove the large size of Zotovia from the tanking hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook page a picture of how he seems to permeate the hatch of the tank vehicle in a very good mood and not, at least, based on those images, it's all about being stuck or getting angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the tanks, it was BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel. I've served at Ural.
I went inside, I looked around, and I came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov, the Russian army's TV channel, explained at the exhibition that he wanted Russia's new technology because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriages. I was interested in our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next exhibition, I'm definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the vans, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called upon the writer who wrote it to be a fool.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photo of the alleged imprisonment has been published, even though 50 000 people attended the weapons exhibition during a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with the Bloknot.ru site case, where Zotov was told to get out of the tank hatch when he tried and threatened to shoot everyone around him, unless he could get out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article where the organisers of the exhibition reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his great size, simply stayed while he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said Alexander Pisarevski to Bloknot, the coordinator of the exhibition.

Architects Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candle from 1962 seems to have been designed today.

The Agnico Eagle Finland Mine of Canadian-owned mining company has been leaking.
The process water purified in the gold mine has flowed from the so-called wealth of sand to its stream.
According to the company, measures to correct the bleeding have started.
There is a foaming process with neutralised enriched sand and purified process water.
In general, water is either re-used as process water or managed in accordance with the authorisation through the surface area through the environment.
The bleeding was estimated at approximately 300 cubic meters per hour when observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leakwater meets the current permit conditions.
It's the only thing that's ever flown into the environment.
The bleeding was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the dam structures of the pool has been observed.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danske Kuoppamä: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published by the IMF today follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization has patented structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing over-employment benefits and paid leave would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole system of agreements and for the security of unemployment.
According to Danske Bank's main economist Pasi Kuoppapimäe, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there are a lot of useful messages for government activities, but on the other hand there is also a warning about what should not be too much to cut.
These include infrastructure investments, for example, Kuoppamaki says to the Economy.
In addition, the IMF believes that growth projects should be implemented within the timescale as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF foresees an economic growth rate of 0.4% in Finland for this year, which will increase to 0.9% next year.
Danske predicts today, in his new business forecast, the growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is slightly more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing in the summer, says Kuoppamaki.
Less attention has been paid to the impaired confidence in industry or other so-called softer measures.
However, the differences only concern a few per cent of decimals.
The dying Nintendo appointed a new leader
In July, the Tatsumi Kimishima, who was working under the Iwata cancer, started her work on Wednesday, told Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led the Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic with the face of the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii console launch.
A 65-year-old Kimishima choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to take Nintendo into play, but not to eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles.
More and more minors are arriving in Finland alone asylum seekers
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country would disappear annually.
For example, SVT.se and Dagens Nyhetter have reported on their website that hundreds of minors are lost annually in the country, according to the Swedish Immigration Service.
Jõha Kannelmaa, Senior Auditor of the Finnish Immigration Service, reports on the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear in the year?- In 2013 a total of 156 applications were made for asylum among minors who came alone.
They're gone. They're gone.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11, Kannelmaa reports missing.
The result of the disappearance may be that it is clear from the hearing that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been found to be full-time there.
In that case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue handling the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were made for the reason that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the amount of growth going on?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors who have become alone.
The total statistics for minors who have been missing this year are not yet available, but the number of applicants of minors is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of persons lost.
What happens to those who have a conversion decision?
Are they also disappearing, for example, for the blind labour market?
This is difficult to assess by the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the return decisions.
Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered people.
He has taken action on this matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who had considered the issues of refugees at the EU's interministerial meeting, reported practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A studio online - see pictures of devices
The equipment used for Timo T.A. Mikkosen's TV and radio productions is now available for sale because of medical incidents in the media sector, which has lost their working capacity.
Mikkkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells in Huuto.net equipment which once became one of the most advanced professionals in the industry.
The first one on the Internet reported was Iomacasin.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the legs of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV programs are no longer described for Betacam tapes.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested people will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but it is necessary as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and self - studio builders, Nina Mikkonen thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from his current Myrskylä home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've started to invent and see where things are going.
This is what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no longer any use for TV or radio.
It's clear from the evidence that a man who's made a long career doesn't return to work anymore.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold now.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's actual life work was archived in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited the box shop with films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic is threatening to get a lot worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday.
Metro and track drivers are deciding today whether to expand their efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration of mind.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram transport only during the period of demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be resolved whether the traffic will stop all day.
Mr. Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is big on the field.
Night-and-wire cuts make the drivers a lot of noise, so the government plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
However, the monster wonders that the shutdown of traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and track wagons stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is practically almost completely stopped.
According to VR's data, trains do not travel between 6 a.m. on Friday morning and evening.
There's no passing or remote traffic on Friday.
The trains leaving before dawn are driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, the majority of the buses are left on the screen.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday mornings at 3:00 a.m. on Saturday mornings at 3:00 p.m.
A small number of buses are likely to be driven; they are driven by superior forces, according to HSL's informant Pirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL is unable to tell us exactly which bus shifts will take place on Friday.
Wage and salary organisations organise a major exhibition at the Helsinki Rautatientor on Friday 11-13 p.m.
Aftonbladt: Hungarian police used tears gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used waterfalls against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, the teacher thought he was a bomb of a self-made watch.
In the United States, Ahmed Mohammed, 14 years old, has been arrested after his teacher considered himself to be a bomb on his own.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted only to present his electronic hardware for output.
But one of the teachers thought the bell looked like a bomb.
The police were invited, and the situation ended with the delivery of the boy to the youth arrest cell in handcuffs.
Mohammed has never been found to have claimed anything else than that he had made the clock.
Still, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of doing the wrong thing.
Mohammed said the cops said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is kept by the police, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital screen between which there were leaders.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished with three days of coercion from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Ilmland Council in the country wonders if the case is another evidence of Islamophobia in the United States.
British - Labour leader refused to sing national songs
In the song God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn has also joined with its own Labour Party representatives.
This has hurt the people, thought the Labour nationalist Kate Green's public radio company in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s Memorial was honoured for the battle of British Air Force pilots against Germany’s Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and stresses his respect for pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a tremendous debt of gratitude for the heroism of royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) was respectfully silent during the national song, and the opinion was emphasised.
Corbyn's choice of party leader has divided the Labouri lines.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will dispel moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral proliferation, the cessation of savings and the increase in public expenditure.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn will be present in Parliament as Head of Party during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron crawled around the weekend on Twitter with Corbyn's choice as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister referred it to his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear... about the father of the family waiting for the case.
The South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating the family death in Minnesota Greenwood a week ago.
The five-man family was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
First after he shot his wife in the shotgun and three of her children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead days already
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house for inspection and found a huge house on various sides as the Short family's dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million houses and a successful company
The investigation of the South Lake Mintoonka Police Chief Michael Siar is still ongoing.
The motive for blood transfusions is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on a social media site directed at nurses at AllNurses.com.
In 2014 StarTribunen interview Short told us that there are four million different visitors per week.
I've been offered 50 purchases for the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a business, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that in 2011 the Short family bought a hulppe house with $2 million from Greenwood.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as a car collector’s dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also an garage sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the family's father was waiting for a case.
Achieveve Test Prep, offering different presiding courses, had sued him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there were no pre-prepping comments on the website, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loir offered you the cake coffee.
In addition, the owner's three prizes were awarded at the food event with the Finnish Hippos month horse owners.
It's great. Loiri's admiring his honour table.
The celebrated Fabrace Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the great competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the gymnastic coach of the horse gets a full job peace when working with the horse.
It's up to the chef to decide where the horse is going to be taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Loiri's laugh.
"The greatest donation ever made by a athlete"
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the medical information, this is the largest ever-time donation made by a athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, Subban, 26 years old, is committed to helping the hospital with other funds for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal worth $72 million a year ago with the Canadiens.
So Subban's donation amount is significantly higher than his $9 million years.
To pay for his donation, Subban will receive his name from the hospital a lobby space.
The Canadiens players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
One year ago, the long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a large amount of money for another city’s large hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese coffee shop for the night... -...and serve just a bikini and an essay on her.
The theme coffees are a tough story in Japan.
The markets already have a goat coffee shop, a canned coffee shop, a vampire coffee shop, a coffee shop, and now a wife's coffee shop.
It hits lonely, social, and hungry.
It's the Metro news.
From Tokyo, Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee can be ordered by a wife or husband for dinner.
It's a waitress who pretends to be a client's spouse.
The half is selected from the list before the coffee shop comes, and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife's in front of her only essays and bikinis, the husband's back in tight wheelchairs.
The web site offers a wife’s doctor all the information about length and weight to what type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: car security attacks began to be equipped
The Automobile Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in this area, as explained in the Communication published by Intel.
The Board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of cybersecurity best practice.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the ASRB findings.
The International ICT research and consultation firm Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles are connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and distribute online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, director of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cyber safety is an important element in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car starts to have a view in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the car world's eyes are at Frankfurt's auto exhibition.
Thanks to Ford's new four-wheeled RS, 2,3-litre, 350-hevolved engine, it has a hundred and top speed of 4,7 seconds from zero to 100 and 266 kilometers per hour.
There is also a price of interest in Finland, which is indicatively estimated at EUR 52 000.
The car is now available, although the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not tell when they are informed.
The favourite brand Kia presented two news at the Frankfurt auto exhibition - such is the new Sportage and Optima
A new generation of Sportage, which is likely to catch a larger wing of the ever-growing nuclear nuclear market, will be more important than two new ones in Finland.
The Sportage created under Gregory Guillaume, a new European design director, is more circular than ever.
The distance between the battery and the external dimension is one cent over here, and the car is cutting air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but has been added to a 1.6-litre turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and more about consumption are reported below sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, because we will have a new Sportage coming in in spring 2016.
Even before the change of year, we have new Kia Optimats.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of upper middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Initially, Optims are obtained with 1.7 litres of turbodiesel and 2.0 litres of petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
In the same time with its arrival, the sale of Optima Farm will begin.
Chisu came back to the stage, smuggled in a brave haalarias.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a visible, open neck hole in the electric pants suit.
The place is a beautiful display of the siron waist of the singer's star.
The whole is crowned with golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three - year break, the mother - in - law singer has been deprived of the pounds of pregnancy by light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to last a year.
The singer published his first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really excited to get back on stage and get up in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed everything about music, the singer tells me.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will publish his new album, together with its fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people can find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's mother-in-law's mother-in-law is starting to suffocate again. Now, I see the chest.
A real-time beauty Kim Kardashia gives a theme for one after another.
He shows his pregnancy jacket and breast-feeding freely in sexy clothes, last night at one American time, when he left his sister Kourtney Kardashian and husband Kanye West's show.
The black motherhood dress is transparent from the front.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress in the flash of lightning.
Last time, Kardashia dressed up as an American motherhood when she visited her friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
Assetta stressed the black over-poln boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week's Friday, when she had a pregnancy jacket on her presentation.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary about the Spying Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about a clean model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six strong truths from Leloup.
Every season starts out empty.
Even if during the previous season you would have been in top designer costumes, the new season will begin again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete for works with frogs.
These models rarely have places to call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take place a year in such a way that there is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses can house their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be intolerablely difficult.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one sort of thinness.
Agent New York may ask for pounds to drop, but then they say you're too thin in Paris.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Design models and designers are together all the time, while operating as a support network.
When the fashion lines stop, the difference's a good one.
The models want this sector, because of the opportunities it offers, but they are missed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is only about showing clothing.
The models also want to be their own.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors with some kind of role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
You were modeling at Tory Burch's show last night.
New York is currently having fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their collection next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, plays an unidentified Abilanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala as the founder member of the band in the movie based on the early years of the Apulanta Association.
In 1991, Lautala founded an aid agreement with Toni Wirtase, but in 1994 she resigned.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the right Antti before the shoots, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I just learn her play style from the video.
I don't want to make a impression of a human being.
The man who trusts the Roope Salminen and the Dogs team just empty doesn't go into the role.
The punk maner comes with him naturally.
During the punk period of the stars, stars, many must have seen the taste as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our presence has never been anything small, but we always go full.
In the aid of 1993-2004 the main actors of the Tuukka Temos film, led by Tuukka Temos, were announced today.
A nuclear force known to the audience in the band is being presented by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki plays Teppo Manner, singer from Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about his future washing yesterday evening when he told him that he was mysteriously preparing his career for the most important day.
Roope has already published on Instagram yesterday a picture of his new story, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, who was seen earlier in the box and in the pantry, has shaved his face as silopos, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist counsels: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees who are seeking a Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about at all?
It doesn't have to be talked about, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting younger children, and for example does not allow them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay on the inside of the mind and intrude, he says.
However, if a child has encountered or heard from refugees on TV news, it is worth speaking about.
It is good to have a conversation about the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You don't have to be afraid of the charge, even if you're bullying yourself and you're scared.
A younger child is closely following the conduct of his parents.
If parents themselves stay calm during the conversation, the child too will feel safe.
The older children are likely to encounter a debate on refugees in school, with friends, or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them about it if they think about it.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can meditate on how our family feels about this.
At the end of the day, though, do we feel that the world is safe or safe?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety, as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child is given a model of how to deal with the problems ahead of life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
You're out of your own power?
But you can still be a good parent to your child.
Severe control of the bleeding Pallosalama
Perttu Pohjola was able to climb into the dark middle of the attack in the Appola Pallosalama.
It only broke profits and second graders until the end of July in Tampere's raves came to collapse.
Since the slave first jumped, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered his child to stay safe from the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the report.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease wasn't the least of its problems, but the debilitating of it required two courses of medicine.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be light on the move, Pohjola says he is pleased with the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku at its record time after the second SE-mama Taruntule.
Apilan Pallosalama was under very much pressure when it could only have been driving for a few weeks.
Those things in view of the small bending at the end were understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good race made the Ori steel.
The horse’s flow must have moved on from it, and I hope that it would also be even more balanced.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called sense of humor.
When you haven't had a good time, you could throw fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have removed such a flashbook that the opponents have been amazed.
At steady speed, the turtles will not be able to reach Pallosala, even with warm - blooded rides.
There's a pageant in Vermo's hopes.
However, there is a difference in how the Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might just fall under the car's boom and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave would be calmer than Turku's leaving.
When Apilan Pallosalama is in order, we can also come from the bow, and we will go out to win with it, the coach's permission.
That's why you can't get rid of the useless iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, explains Tim Cook Buzzfeed during an interview with its CEO.
Apple’s iPhone contains a series of programs that are relatively rarely used: for example FaceTime calls, Journalists, Health, Exchanges, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as an forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook said that removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple’s iPhone applications worked closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So according to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company does not want to waste memory on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1% year-on-year, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by the reduction in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised a slightly downward estimate of 0.2% of the budget of a few weeks ago.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
In August, the so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the whole of the 28 EU regions was zero in August.
The rise in July was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most in the euro area, i.e. by 1.4 per cent in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest in price reductions by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium term.
On average, the ECB predicts inflation of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
The next year will increase to 1.1%, with the central bank forecasting in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The United States Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The next U.S. recession starts at its fastest in less than a year, but most certainly within three years after Fed takes a long time to raise its interest rates.
And in the financial markets, the submergence begins before the next recession.
Fed has indicated that he might have started the interest payments this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be hit at its fastest by next autumn and in the form of a financial market exchange rate before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they've been doing, and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money mines as they have done before.
Such conclusions have led to the conclusion that the German bank Deutsche Bank's market research strategies in London, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, in their extensive long-term market and economic research.
The bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international major customers last week.
The strategies that drew up the study and the report do not believe they are aware of when exactly Fed will begin to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market afterwards.
Instead, they present with cool facts and calculations of economic statistics how the economy and the market have previously behaved during and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they look at the key factors of the economy and financial markets, which are now, or are, the same model as in past interest rates - and possibly the result thereof.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a higher state than once in the 1950s.
Maybe not a year before the beginning of the recession.
Fed's monetary policy, and its current impetus, the leaders who decided on it, have pointed out last summer and early autumn that the time has come to be mature for raising interest rates.
For more than nine years, the first interest rate may be due this week.
This matter will be settled in the middle of the week and Thursday when the so-called open market committee of the Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised his so-called Fed funds guidance interest rate in June 2006.
At the end of the two-year period, a relatively regular, but at a time, a small,25 percentage point interest rate series ended, with Fed raising its interest from 1,25 % to 5,25 %.
In 2007, the financial market's symptom began to suffer from the difficulties of the most high-risk housing financing in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis was torn into a global day of judgment.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy failures started to slower than have been typically since earlier Fed's interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and worse than once in the 1930s.
Deutsche strategies have been screening the rises and declines in the world's largest economies, as well as the financial market turn since 1950, and in places from the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact are being clarified since the 1950s.
The first withdrawal period has been less than one year, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended in the course of the year-to-year period from the start of Fed's interest rates.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, Fed has increased and reduced its steering interest rate by a dozen different-dimensional cycles.
Each time, there has been a difference between others, and there is a relatively limited number of times in the review, so it is unlikely that there will be any certainty about the impact of the next interest rates.
The strategies point out that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Rates too low for too long
The critical reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be undisputed by decades of research.
But three points of the crisis, and for the reasons that have increased its destructive power, must be somewhat undisputed:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other largest central banks in the world considered their steering interest rates to be too long too low.
They were placing traces of the technology, and at the same time they raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the rise in the different parts of the financial and real economy, and the debt ratio already too high, increased from the monetary policy of the central banks to the greater extent.
So far, the largest debt bubble in the history of the economy was born.
3) Especially in the financial sector, the most frequently offered mad-down debt financing hit most of the financial market sectors by the highest exchange rates in the economic history of the past on shares in real estate, debt securities and commodities.
Also, it is unlikely that it will be difficult to argue that the financial markets that have risen to heights in the form of increasingly complex debt instruments were in a rare dangerous and unstable divided position when Fed and other central banks last drove up the interest rates.
The financial structure of debt instruments could not last as long as the valuation scales had started after the purchase of interest rates and the cost of debt financing had gone up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Greater bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of nuclearisation by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now held their monetary policy on even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) In the long term, debt has not been madly cheap as it was ten years ago, but debt money is now, at its worst, literally cheaper than it is to express.
As a result, the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, debt has become more difficult than the debt burden before or before the financial crisis.
3) The majority of the liquidity that has been issued out of the previous quarter and lower than the central banks has fallen into the financial market and the main types of securities and assets have become most expensive since the peak preceding the financial crisis or ever.
Furthermore, not only the financial market warning marks, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and from the most serious recession in decades to the model of the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but according to the pressures and risks on the financial markets are much higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed is now starting to tighten up its money.
Perhaps the future image of the French bank's Societe Generale strategy, Albert Edwards, is not as strange as it suddenly might seem.
He has been training the Bank’s international investors for the following full translations:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the cash flow will come out, and soon, it's time Fedin would be a good time to push off the financial fires with even bigger QEs.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) who makes computers and printers will reduce up to 330,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at the company service side of HP, the company tells.
In November, HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., a company focusing on pc machines and printers for consumers.
The maximum number of HP staff in 2011 was 350000.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 30,000.
The company records one-off expenses of $ 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25,000 employees.
The consumer's reductions will remain at 3300 in three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that it has balanced its business so that none of its customers anymore account for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the second year, 65 per cent of the operating income was generated by its three most important customers.
iOS 9: Apple publishes a new operating system – thus installing its iPhones
The new operating system can be installed by selecting the Settings, General and Software Update first.
If the phone is ready for update, it urges you to download and install a new operating system.
Some users have experienced problems since the installation: The phone has displayed an error message "the software upgrade failed".
In the event of an error notification, users are invited to wait for the crash to decommission or to try to update via iTunes.

The update may require the removal of applications to release space. However, Apple has made the update more compact. In addition, there is a tool available to remove applications and install them again after the update.
When updating the software room, it is worth making sure that there is a download on the phone and that the charger is available so that the current does not stop between the download.
If the download level is too low, the phone will not allow the update to start. If the phone battery is empty between the update, the update may be broken.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of a tax haven company
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the government of the tax haven company.
Ylen stated that the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo, appointed as a member of the Board of Directors, Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself says that he left a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough I've filed a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, says Berner at Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the ownership of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a car park manufacturer which merged with Karelia-upofloor, Finnish car park manufacturer in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia Upofloor government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Government and in the Luxembourg company.
According to Ylen, Kährs’ holdings in Luxembourg are carried out through a multi-portal ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a government membership at the Luxembourg company Kährs' second largest owner's request.
This is the owner of Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia Upofloor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partnership was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital income is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that there is no tax planning for Hartwall Capital's property in the company.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs in the capital fund Triton had already completed the Luxemburg holding company.
Espoo opens a reception centre run by the company
In Espoo, Otaniemi, the first reception centre operated by the company is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from this evening.
The number of places can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the building of the former Rescue College.
Luona Oy is a company that is active in the production of health care and health care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the Centre’s security arrangements.
STKT prepares alternative work pressure package
STKT is about to prepare an alternative package for the tensions of the government's working life.
The organisation also hopes that other wage-tier central organisations will be included.
According to President Antti Palola, today attention is in the light of Friday.
Alternative means to reduce the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone appreciates that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out on a break from the organization’s administrative meeting to journalists.
In contrast, Palola estimates that the Central Alliance for Business (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The Economists of the STKT have calculated that the security of change contained in the Government's Competitiveness Package is estimated to cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if the party has a terrible passion for having a conversation if there's one relationship with 100.
Palola: The consultation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (cent.) has asked for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to provide a communication of its own package to Parliament and start preparing for the reforms.
Palola did not take the view on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the discussion of the government exists and has been constructive to him all the time.
According to Palola, an operation on Sundays is a painful place.
The organisation requires the government to retreat from coercive legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STKT, Palola does not allow an alternative package to be prepared with SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday to Helsinki to oppose the work pressure package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the first days of sickness are cut, the over-work benefit is halved, the Sunday allowance is reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
STKT emphasises that the central organisations have called employees to the protest, and that there has been no intention of strike.
The plan's Fjäder thanking you
The plan president, Mr Fjäder, congratulates the STKT on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STKT is now coming to the same lines as Akaka, because there is already a longer-defined alternative model for government presentations in Akaka.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK package it is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The plan president, Mr. Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK led by Lauri Lylyn will come forward and prepare the presentation as an alternative for operations.
Antti Palola STKT said earlier Wednesday that she was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it has long prepared its own proposal, which is ready to negotiate the 5 % level of competitiveness proposed by the government as an alternative to cuts.
The scheme has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have been writing an alternative model for government presentations for a long time.
We are ready to look at the terms of service as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akva’s lines, as STKT has previously done on Wednesday.
Without SAS, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday 15 a.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.

The prime ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Ylen on Wednesday night at 21.05 p.m.
When applying for the previous Prime Minister's speech, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister in holding the famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers held several radio calls during the winter and further wars.
In the 1990s, instead of President Mauno Koivisto, Esko Aho gave the speech of the New Year, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen closed the train crew strike on television.
Alone, monarchist makeup
The sound of a pig has been raising all day's criticisms and guessions about what I'm going to have to say.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the left-wing movement, said on Twitter that "The Sipilä could speak on the status of the nation as a Prime Minister's announcement, which would allow the speech to be discussed as well".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "one voice has already been seen.
The leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP's Erkki Judges condemned that "monarchist makeup: the Prime Minister will tell the people what's best for it".
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "A few and a half years from the elections.
Not just a prime minister on the media with an opposition.
It's been tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts for about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented on in direct mail by the Chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and Jyri Häkäminen, CEO of the EC.
Yle has been criticised for making Sipila's speech.
We considered this and said that it was part of the public service task to promote comprehensive public access in Finland, the director of Yle's publications in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle.
It's like we're in Tammelos' time.
The speech has also been raised by the smiles.
The dinner that comes in the evening is enjoyed in good time, the kids are combed and put on their best.
Mom put on the nicest plunger, and Dad settles his tie with his neck.
At nine o'clock, it's slowing down to TV like before I used to be in the Tammeloos time," writes the bloggari Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also state in his speech why the Finnish Government is sitting in the tax havens of millions of hidden capitals, who make laws of pardon for other tax reptiles and, at the same time, claim to the people that they have to operate when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
For what Sipilä says, one guess presents the University of Tampere's Green Leftman Viva.
It's been released on Facebook by a bingo over there.
Do we hear of the same boat, the same carbon, the living and the team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are finished, it starts at 21.05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisar in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to withdraw Al Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up his power, says President Martti Ahtisari Guardian.
According to the Ahti Island, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan that would have been elegantly out of power after some time.
However, the Western countries did not meet the proposal because they thought al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Mr Ahtizar discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaare, in a bilateral debate, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed him three points of the plan: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and al-Assad lost power had to be slowed down.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all these matters, but we will be able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down with Alaska, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtizar will remember during an interview with Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtizar reports that Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate, but according to Ahti Island there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on the claims made by the Ahtisaare, but said that the Al Assad forces had already committed a number of massacres at that time, and the key opposition groups refused all agreements in which they would have gone to power.
According to his experience, Russia was never prepared to discuss Al-Assad's fate.
Officially, Russia has supported Al Assad throughout the war.
The point that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate is to argue with the Ahtisaare.
If he'd told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have answered that I'd like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that Putin's spear would have held power on some Al Assad supporter.
The refugee flow into our own actions
During the negotiations on the Ahti Island, some 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
Over 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes for war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own.
I don't see any choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill we made ourselves, Ahtizar says to the press.
Asylum applicant organisation centre with anthrax in Tornio
An asylum centre designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the building of the Tornio jointation building empty in the city centre.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better control the refugee flows from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsinki Sanomat announced that the Bureau had already decided to present the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Höppinen, the Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, it is not true.
When the entire delegation was not assembled and some of the people wanted to have a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he would specify it to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43.
The organisation centre was opposed to 13 delegates.
On that basis, the decision could be expected to be positive, says Höppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received no contact on Monday, and a rapid reaction was made.
It would provide an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred yards from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
There is still a desire for a job market option for blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (cent.), half of the public holiday payments would only take part in the calculation of the price of work pursued by the government.
However, the government is happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners can agree on such an option.
Sipilä told the editors in the Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for compensatory means for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement comes into existence, we will, of course, be happy to accept it as part of the overall package.
The half-life of the holidays in Sipila would be a means of working, since it would be directed at almost all employees, unlike, for example, the surgery of Sundays envisaged by the government.
Labour organisations could agree on cutting holiday money, since they are registered in collective agreements rather than law.
On Wednesday next week, the Government will present these views to Parliament on the challenges of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to the wing, the organisations' proposals should be aware of this before.
This is not the final back line either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train is on the move, and it will become more and more difficult.
We've got a lot of time.
After all, it will not take long to deal with such matters if there is a will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published last week by the government includes, for example, the conversion of the stealth and helatorista into unpaid days without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first days of sickness is cut, over-work benefits are halved, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as coercion legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
Wage and salary organisations organise a major demonstration on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärve's council approved the extension of the juice grey warehouse
The Tohmajärve Council approved unanimously but a slight expansion of the stocks of Nordic Koivu Oy, i.e. the juice hall.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than it had been originally spoken.
A busy schedule, too.
It was also a little wonder that the need for order was not known a year ago when a decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, the extension of the stock of 400-450 square metres was approved in the Investment Programme, but the financing will be decided more frequently in the context of the Interim Report.
The agenda was still talking about investing between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, the Technical Director, Erkki Iconen, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the local community.
The company pays for the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (ps.) was justified.
The Karelian language even has its place in Joensuu
The city government reduced its earlier steep position to bring the Latvian street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the election of the cattle tradition throughout the county.
Joensuu does not declare it the capital of the livestock language, because it has no historical basis, nor is it an inherent part of the identity of the territory.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region is more of an Eastern Savoy.
After a new decision, there will be no street name signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, prepared to use the cattle language, for example, in the information tables and the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude of the city recommends all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single - language municipality, it is also worth taking an open attitude to the use of the livestock language now that multiculturalism is living and is rapidly changing in Northern Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still specific features of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole forest capital city of Finland.
Both of them can benefit from a wide range of marketing activities in the region.
The closures of the trains will cut the vitality of the county
The operation of the trains will strike the county’s vitality with a strong hand.
Transport links directly affect the business and competitiveness of the region.
And that affects whether or not you can live and work here at all, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has been on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the country as a whole that we should not be able to reduce our possibilities by means of government measures, as is the case today.
The effects of the closures of these transport links, for example, on employment, are to be considered by the Karjalainen.
The deterioration of transport connections leads to an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier to get students and employees, says Director Jukka Mönkkönen of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that bad traffic connections also affect the faculty, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
The Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already the marketing of the University towards Western Finland is difficult, as transport connections are weak in the lateral direction.
At present, about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, around 10-20 percent of them are from the new world, which is partly explained by a direct connection to the train.
Joensuu became one of my ringtones for Siu's war.
The view of the City Government of Joensuu on the regional Siu sote project is apparently unanimous, but one among the sounds.
Mr Pentti Kesso (sd., in the picture) presented the whole project at the government's Monday meeting, but his presentation fell unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed before the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
The passenger transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one pair of trains is less frequent.
There will be changes in passenger trains between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of train passes away, but still five times a day gets to Kotka Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to state savings.
The purchase of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely cut off.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped from the place.
The rescue facility let a 12-year-old climb on the roof, who couldn't help himself down the roof.
The situation occurred on the Tornion Hill in Ketotie at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two - story wooden house where there are no ladders on the roof at all.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the house to the roof along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same path, but one didn't.
The result was that others drifted from the place and the passers alarmed the rescue facility to help the latter safely back to the surface.
FedEx's net sales fluctuation, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak outcome in the last quarter, and the transport industry weakened its forecast throughout the year due to a decrease in demand for freight services and increased costs for land transport.
The company intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company’s share decreased by approximately 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of actual trade on Wednesday.
The FedEx forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial period ending in May.
According to FactSet's research, analysts predicted $10.84.
The average rate has deteriorated despite the increase in the price of 4.9% on average. The increase will take effect on 4 January. Additional charges for land transport of heavy or large-sized consignments will enter into force in November.
The company is still waiting for results growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and increased online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith noted that the company has been performing in a very low-than-expected economic situation, particularly in the face of production and global trade.
The date of notification of seasonal workers' recruitment plans was the day after the competitor UpSecrets announced his plans to pay approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 persons.
In the fourth quarter of August, FedEx’s operating profit was USD 692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
The share-specific result was $2.42, so the $2.44 forecast of the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research remained.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be EUR 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has tried to reduce the number of international first-class broadcasts, which is why the activity of the Express unit has been in place.
The strong growth in the online trade has confirmed the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, turnover in land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating profit showed an increase in the cost of large-scale shipments and insurances.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on cargo business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the real trade, FedEx's share rate had decreased to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $15.15.
On Tuesday, the share decreased by 11 per cent from the average of the year and by 17 per cent from the highest issue recorded on 11 June.
This week the decision-makers of the U.S. Central Bank Fed will meet for years at the most expected meeting. A group will sit at the end of a eight-foot stand in Honduras to decide whether the time will for the first time raise interest rates to almost a decade.
On the wall of the two-storey meeting room, the central bank is equipped with a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, along with Janet L. Yellen's colleagues, must put the economic advantage of the State above all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximise employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
However, since the Great Lakes, the Governor of the Central Bank has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be missing from the point of view of a piece of kire decision. Thursday, the Central Bank is expected to state whether the US economy is ready to start a withdrawal of unforeseeable irritation, which has been offered by short interest rates, which, near zero, by the end of 2008, has been maintained.
Although the majority of data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent death of the financial markets can be made ready for a prudent central bank to falsify the increase in the volatility by increasing the reference rate of federal taxes – even in a quarter of the unit.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market is to give enough cause to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree with what the central bank intends, which in itself already causes nervousness.
About half of the economics study by Bloomberg exhausted the increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial market is estimated to be expected by the central bank and, according to the key indicator, only 30% will be able to raise.
If the central bank lifts its control interest rate, the stock exchange rates can fall unless the decision-makers take a soft blow by promising another raise.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index created 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"There were expectations that the central bank would keep the control basket stable this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, Chief Economist John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank would raise interest at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank should carefully consider how to keep the hands of those working on the financial markets intact."
Second, the experts noted that the increase in interest rates could calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to tilt to increase interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in strengthening the financial situation and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yelle has said that she has been waiting for spring and early summer to raise interest rates this year – despite the fact that the Liberals believe that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent in the last month, which is now at its lowest for seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
The income from the salary seems to be getting agitated.
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank, the central bank’s decision-makers stated that the main reason for this was a sharp temporary effect of oil prices.
"The economy can work with higher interest rates and needs them, as long as they take account of the strict situation on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , financial markets around the world did not bother last month when China’s currencies were deformed .
Down to 16 percentage points of record height in May and investors feared that the economic downturn in China would also affect global growth.
The markets have been fragmented this month, and Dow Jones has already decreased by nearly 10% from May's top readings.
The market failure means for the decision-makers of the Central Bank that the reflection of the rise in the steering interest rate will become more complex.
"The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and what news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy has been carried out in recent weeks", the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate senior researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Inner stated.
He now believes that the Central Bank will wait at least one month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information about the situation since the recent developments in the Chinese economy", Oliner said.
The improvement of the global economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so it should not, in principle, affect the decision-making process of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential player in the world’s monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, just a suggestion from President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow down the scope of its activities led to a revolution around the world.
In today’s world markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring world trends, the central bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts so that it has a good global picture of the world economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, Director of the Global Strategy of Envestnet Inc.
On this month, the President of the European Central Bank, Jeffrey Packer, said that the Central Bank had previously overrepresented financial market movements that do not seem to be connected to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), Mr Lacker, has called for an increase in the control rates, setting an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia resulted in the decision by the central bank at three meetings to calculate the steering interest rate by 0,75 percentage points, although only limitedly identifiable sanctions were available for US economic growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank repealed the decision.
"The central bank should give priority to monetary stability only in a major crisis, such as the collapse of the 2008 economy", said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
Last time he died, he said, "I don't even think about the situation in the chair."
"There is no point in fear of a market shock," Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability. Before this change occurs, I should not go ahead."

The Rio Granden Children’s Association of Brazil’s Children’s Medical Association promotes a proper diet for people who are breast-feeding
The Rio Granden Children’s Association SPRS has developed a blind way of teaching breast-feeding women the meaning of a proper diet.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, so that the baby gets all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kg.
In addition to increasing calorie levels, other dietary changes should be made in addition to the new study.
Robert Waterland’s recent study of Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an abnormal diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Sevenst viewers on Sunris, even though Nine tries to get a lead on Today's Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would like Canberra to do the morning program on the after-sales of the Liberal Party leadership, which, however, did not much improve Today's viewers.
The morning program of the Nine Channel was sent from the capital of Malcolm Turnbull, a secluded Tony Abbott.
The morning program of David Koch and Samantha Armytage was sent from London to compete channel. Special broadcasts of the week are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
On the way to the distance it was not apparent that it was important for Australian television viewers, as Sunrise had an average of 397 000 viewers in five states’ capitals, and today’s programme was 339 000 viewers.
The number of viewers in Today rose slightly on Mondays (317 000) and Tuesdays (283 000), but last Thursday there remained a reading (343 000).
Today's been strangling the distance to Sunr's in the past few months.
In August Today, on average, there were 318,000 viewers, Sunris had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40 000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 viewers and 314 000 viewers today.
This is the most interesting thing in the morning.
The changes in the wind will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking me!

The Seven had a significant novelty of 800 Words news series, including the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move on the coast of New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached the peaks of 1 219 000 viewers.
The critics have suspected that Thomson would be a star of the hit series alone, without Rebecca Gibney as the Rafthers star.
According to yesterday's viewers, the answer is clearly positive.
Seventin The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1 136,000 viewers. The series was brightly defeated by the Block (838 000) and the TBL Family series (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured the viewers differently.
On average, 446 000 viewers followed Andrew O'Keefe's first half hour of his new sketch series (17.00–17.30).
In another semi-known (17.30–18.00), the number of viewers rose to 623,000, which was more than the number of Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, the Chase Australia had an average of 520 000 viewers, and the second half gathered a huge number of 720 000 viewers.
The number of hot Seat viewers was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night viewers showed Nine Channel that Hot Seat will pass until 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Meten, who couldn't challenge McGuire's show.

The finalist believes that Sam Wood really is the Son of the Dreams — but who does the man choose?
Is it a secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have deliberately revealed the choice of dream bachelor.
The final choice of the dream bachelor Sam Wood has been a carefully preserved secret.
Three remaining women don't say a word about who got the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeavos-Fellows before they dropped one out of the threes.
Sam Wood's lips are firmly sealed to the Thursday final.
All three women were inspired by Wood as a perfect man. Women praised man’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him to be a perfect partner of their own qualities.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose were not hit at its own place, their answers could indicate who takes the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski soon named Mackay themselves the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been easy since then.
"When I first came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were well connected. This feeling has been maintained throughout the program," Jeavos-Fellows said.
"Sah has legs on the ground, and he's really funny company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit that there are chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she's a good partner, and Sam Wood's a good partner.
Mackay told me he realized last week on a hometown date that Wood could be the right one.
"When I saw her with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race. I am now making a full contribution to our relationship," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should be chosen, if a man didn't choose her, she answered with mystery:
"I can't say," he said.
I like other girls as much as I like Snezana and Lana.
The dream bachelor on the Ten Channel on Wednesday at 7:30.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayyn as amended by this to the United States. Several other associations also took an interest in the man after the last year's impressive open training day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some trainers would have liked Hayne on the bench, as a man went to the Australian rugby country team in the ranks. Hayne scared the flight dropback team with the victory on Tuesday from Minnesota, as reads 20 to 3.
Tomsula, however, showed his confidence in Hayne and gave him another chance to return the plane fire. Coach had Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his line in the dresser after the game.
He did not rob the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, but encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers special editor Cam Inman reports that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed catch and concentrate on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne will be covering for the capture of the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game.
Hayne and his Australian fan crew had been waiting for another man from NFL-debyy.
Hayne left the field after failure and later told Hamish and Andy about 2DayFM 104.1 channel that couldn't have imagined a worse start for their NFL career.
"They happen, and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error with her debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when her input in her own region opened a place for Queensland.
In its whole experience, however, it was amazing for a 27-year-old.
Hayne published a photo on Instagram, where he poses together with fans and Australian flags.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.

Four dead policemen shot with rubberoid protestors in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the source of the authority told me Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of people in the misdemeanors against the alleged new constitution, including a four-year-old boy.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandeh, about three hundred miles [300,000 km] away from the capital of Katmandu.
According to District Manager Bishop Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protestors were gathered outside the police station, some of which were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me the police were using the tear gas and shot him in the air before he shot the rubber holes.
He said twenty policemen and five civilians were wounded.
It is not quite clear why the rubberoids, which can kill but which are generally considered to be a less destructive alternative, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent assembly of weeks in protests on the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhes tribe, the new provinces based on the new Constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent chains since August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement on the distribution of the country into the region, it is a major step towards a new constitution, but it is a very sensitive topic in Nepal, where administration has been concentrated for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses of their Katmandus this week, and the authorities believe that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60 % probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
From the wide area of low pressure about 560 km from the southernmost parts of Cape Verde islands, 60 per cent of the probability of developing tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, announced the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Air Science Institute, Cape Verde and the Little Antilles are also located in the middle of a clear low pressure centre. It can also develop into tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign aimed at collecting $111 million for humanitarian aid organisations that will help thousands of people who have fled across Europe in war and poverty.
Google announced a donation campaign in his blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of running, Google’s employee Rita Masoud started the campaign by telling me about his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he fled Kabul with his family.
"We were traveling on a dark train and bus and we had hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migrant crisis has been shaken, many families in similar situations desperately need help.
Donations are assigned to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children and the UN Refugee Organization.
Once donations have been collected from google.com/refuguerelieef through $5,5 million, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, making the total amount reach 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is the worst since the Second World War, and the situation is getting worse particularly in Syria's four-year civil war, which has caused more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war must also be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
New study showed that low-weight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say if the mildly overweight type 2 diabetes mellitus after a obesity surgery are longer than those receiving treatment without surgery.
"It takes time to obtain data on death," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who examined the new research in the JAMA Survey.
By surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, reduce gastric ulcers by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be an effective form of treatment in type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of studies have been associated with pre-existing overweight subjects whose weight index (BMI) is at least 35.
Weight index indicates weight and length with a normal value between 18,5 and 24,9
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng hospital in Taiwan used data collected from 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and hive surgery, type 2 diabetes treatment in persons with mild muscle.
After an ossification, the mean weight index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index of those treated without surgery was maintained at 29.
Diabetic patients treated with surgery improved by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the treatment group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and only half of the patients.
In the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and poor LDL cholesterol were also superior in the patients treated with surgery.
The investigators also observed haemoglobin levels in patients with a history of development of blood glucose.
The target haemoglobin concentration is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean decrease in haemoglobin A1c was 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value was maintained by approximately 8%.
However, the study group led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu noted that this did not reduce mortality over a period of five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher compared to the treatment group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight index decreased by higher (7.4 and 5.1) as well as haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%).
However, according to the Swedish study of Blackstone, who works at Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgery brings years of life to people in the flesh.
In a Swedish study, the likelihood of death was reduced by 29% in comparison with the conventional treatment group.
However, although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone found that subjects with a weight index less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding of the study, since it says that surgery is safe for the lower weight index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease", Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27-30.
"We expect people to take the situation seriously for too long," the researcher said.
"When genetic changes have arisen in man's body that expose obesity and diabetes, turning the situation into a situation is really difficult."
"All cannot come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has stated, and she believes that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leadership of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, Dalai Lama Centre, which focuses on ethical research, discussed the refugee crisis during its visit to the United Kingdom.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must be placed ahead of individual countries or parts of the continent.
He also stressed that although the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is an impossible idea that everyone could come to Europe", the Dalai Lama said in her speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their action in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Regarding thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing, but at the same time we must consider long-term solutions and how we can achieve real peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education", the Dalai Lama stressed.
"At the end of the day, we need to consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Powers have never solved problems," he added.
As regards violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions in connection with the terrorist attacks of 11 September and claimed that, in its response to the violence, the United States created an uncontrollable chain of events.
"After the 11th September attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would arise through violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to the power that had unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Handling cases four times the number of children in four years
According to Georgia’s poisoning centre, across the United States, alcohol concentrations are reported by nearly fourfold in children under 12 years of age.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the handling cases reported to the poisoning centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of them will have to go to first aid", Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hands on purpose to impress their friends and social media.
YouTube video shows teenagers drinking disinfecting agent because of a cheap hop.
Tens are told to mix alcohol from mouth water to get stronger from drinking.
You can lure smaller children into the smell of handbreads.
"The boy doesn't think it's bad," Lopez said.
"A lot of attractive hand-made products have just been scattered.
There are strawberry, grapes and orange-flavoured hand-made products that appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength by volume of disinfecting substances shall be between 45 % and 95 %.
A small number of infants can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content is very high", according to Stephen Thornton, the medical director of Kansas University Hospital's poisoning centre, Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave whiskey for children, but if hand disinfecting products are often left to children, they will quickly receive a high amount of alcohol."
Six-year-old Thaijah Russell recently enjoyed four brothels of mansic outputs at school, and the girl was delivered for first aid.
"A high blood alcoholic concentration of 179, which is twice the adult hop limit," says the doctor who took care of the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center near Chris Ritchey Atlanta.
Nahijah did not walk when he was brought to first aid.
Doctors followed the girl’s condition overnight in a separate child’s hospital for brain damage, for she had fallen and hit her head after having enjoyed alcohol,” Ritchey told.
"Tilne was really scary," said the Ortoria Scott of Nahijah to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfection wipes, in addition to the fact that the hand should be moved to the children’s quarters.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, part of the disinfecting agents is associated with deaths.
In 2013, two of the Ontario women died when swallowed with a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered the deadly methanol contained in the product rather than ethyl alcohol, although the latter is declared as active substance in the product information document.
According to the police report, three fourth-class pupils in the north of New York City planned to kill a "bad" teacher in January by setting antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is extremely allergic to gloves and refused to bring it into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that had been adopted was meaningless and called for discipline.

Aberdeen’s neck to Celtic five points
ADM Rooney's first half sentence brought Aberdeen a little victory from Hamilton at the Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen's five points to escape from Celtic.
Griffiths evasive speech about non-religion

The Dutch need an old Scottish combat partner – de Boer
The former Rangers middle field player and Dutch national team leader Ronald de Boer have stated that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has been stolen because it is no longer possible to follow the double-tamping of Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, who works in Ajax's team management, said: "There will no longer be any highlights of Celtic's games in Hungary.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"It's not just about the Rangers coming back.
We're talking about Old Firm here.
The Dutch want teams to have a double-match.
Old Firm's games have enormous tension, and they're also interested outside Scotland's borders."
I'll turn it over, Deila will convince you.
RONNY Dela admits that Celtic is difficult, but the Norwegian credit assures us that there will be a change in the situation.
The Society that lost Malmölle fell from the league of the Masters and lost ten players to Aberdeen, which now has a five-point management at the top of the table.
"Celtic's had some difficult episodes before, and we're getting up again," Dela said.
"We want to improve our situation as soon as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it gives rise to hatred or sorrow in many.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic's supporters, because it significantly strengthens the players.
The spirit is now very important."
Warburton Careful with January’s players’ transfers
Even though only a few weeks ago, Rangers-pomo Mark Warburton suggested that January's players should be careful about the transfer role and says that he wants to compromise the unity of the team.
" January's players' transfers differ significantly from the summer's transfers," said Brentford's ex coach.
"The players involved in the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which this season has succeeded in our formation.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player procurement can cause more harm to the team than useful."
Michu, who is thinking about living in Celtic's sights
Swansea's attacker Michu has been linked to Celtic's mobile calls, and Michu, in turn, has suggested retirement since the end of the Swans agreement.
For years, Michu, a 29-year-old, has been an attractive ankle, and he has not managed to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA art from Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team finally lost between 3 and 2. The half-man's red card was later revoked, which is already the third Columin red card in eight months, which will be revoked.
However, Neilson will remain behind his words. "I did not question honesty. I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was nabbed when a man admitted his delicious songs about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
An incident occurred in the pub in Edinburgh in Roseburn before Edinburgh's local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said, "I can guarantee that I will not go back to Tynecastle except in the Celtic lines."
Tannadice's Board of Directors believes in Dundee United coaching leadership – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures me that the Dundee United board can turn the situation into a better one.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes is pleased with Hamilton's victory with a dirty game.
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperately forced to embezzle against Hamilton in front of his seventh successive league. Aberdee won a five-point neck at Celtic at the top of the series table, which has been praised by Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half of the sector.
"There is no cup or league team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
The number of unemployed persons in the UK increased by 10 000 at the same time.
According to the United Kingdom Statistical Centre (Office for National Statistics) the unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent in Scotland, compared to 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
The number of people in work in Scotland is 12 000 less than three months earlier.
Scotland's employment rate decreased to 74.0% in the fourth quarter, with the average UK employment rate of 73.5%.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs David Mundell commented: "The long-term plan of hugging has created a basis for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to maintain its status as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following up the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless the legal basis for the cancellation is found, I will follow execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I don't hope I'll be sitting in the penitentiary execution room of Oklahoma State when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January I received an invitation through the best friend of the man, and despite my shocks, I answered the invitation with approval.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I do it?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you this about the death penalty for a real story.
The angle of vision would be unique.
Journalists will be able to follow executions in the United States, and since applications are more than places, participants will be selected by macaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers' seats from 12 to 5.
The following executions were selected moderately.
I can't do it.
I sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip. I have created a man in a personal relationship because we have spoken on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to prison staff, I can't be in the capacity of both a witness and a journalist, so I can't take memory and pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try to push the details into my mind.
I was accused by an Occlamian journalist on Twitter of jeopardizing neutrality.
"There's a farce here:
When you tell the condemned story in a pleasant way, you'll get close to him."
I gave the reporter my differing opinion.
The supplier admitted that he could have formulated his words more carefully, but still consider my actions to be wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't order what I write, and even if he tries to order, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity promotes the movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post editor Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information about this, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I'm not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty after the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that a man, Glossip, is not guilty of murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his execution.
I can't say I'm completely unbiased.
You can read an unbiased description of other journalists.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from Canning River after the police station.
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry to lure him up from the Canning River.
The Persian man's escape attempt was to get himself into low, mud water, and a couple of meters away from the police got the man back to dry land.
The Canning Vale police received a call on Tuesday about the unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
Upon arrival, the police identified a suspect who was trying to punish the police from their positions by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia did not attract the baptism of the uniform, so he chose a safer tactics – to negotiate.
"At the moment, the escape attempt will make a person resort to attractive means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is an excellent example.
In 2006 Cousins abandoned his car to avoid police blowing and tried to swim across Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the temple inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the actors tried to spy on him, and he threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's agents of a spy business with their deposits last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the agents and the integrity department of Racing Victoria have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tata due to the recent day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that she'd always tried to do something about racing. Moody's been in a difficult situation when she found a cobolt in the Lidar sample, and she couldn't explain the finding.
Moody has been holding her tongue for a year and a half, and she didn't want the charges to affect the bitter operation of the man.
"I didn't intend to raise it. I longed for this, but sometimes frustration breaks down with a one-off," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"You may have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the situation after I opened my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well at night.
I want the horse owners to believe that I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to continue as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to consider my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where she told the integrity department about spy companies in her stable.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart were sitting in the same room and offered a man a job at my stable with a purpose to spy on my actions. I'll tell him when he asked for his name," Moody told Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they would want to present the evidence, because I have not been caught by anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, the former president of the RVL, David Modie, the present president of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of the operation then and now.
Should I consider this to be a personal hunt?
Should the RVL take serious action and assume responsibility for the situation in this area other than training staff?
Am I a bad guy?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I'll still be trained and pushing me away from my duties, and there's no doubt that with my words I'll make a lot of people think that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it's sad.
It's really sad.
I pressure them to make their own decisions.
"My family will support me, and I can withdraw."
In the end, the coach was frustrated by the investigation of the long-term Lidar's cobolts and the recent rejection situation, which threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable master Black Cavari. The man described the day of the race as ridiculous after the horse’s legs had an irregular clay court.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"The person belonging to my staff incorrectly put clay in the foot of the horse.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can expect a three-month ban on competition for anti-harvest treatment that organisers have begun to deal with.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this is going too far", Moody said.
Arrested by Cobram Colari Place
The police have arrested a biker this weekend, a man who ran away from the crash site.
A biker was taken on helicopters to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured by a car to hit him at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who was driving the car ran away from the place and didn't stay here to help a injured biker.
On Monday, the 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to Shepparton's police.
He is likely to be accused of non-compliance with stop and assistance obligations in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital care, and he's stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the opposition to the button talk
The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy regards the criticism of his team's battle game as a purposeful activity of the two NRL leagues.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm a match to Melbourne's hosts in a campaign fight in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, covered the silent reference to Stormin Broncos’ winning karsinafinatal Queensland Cowboys, on Saturday night, and said that there was no special issue in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his team's action game and said they were only focused on contact when they were fighting.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team was added to the criticism of his team by the coach of two top teams. Bellamy considers this to be an indication that trainers worry about losing to Storm.
"This thing is always coming up. I think Trent Robinson didn't say anything about the button when his team won us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee you that we haven't changed anything in our defence system or technology all year long.
Trent's been on his mission for three years, and he might have been shocked because he's got a great team that hasn't been used to losing.
It is interesting that the same thing always arises at the same time of year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his team's Saturday game to our Friday game and considered their game interesting", Bellamy said.
"In 2010 St Georgea was greatly critical of his boring game," Wayne said.
Now he's got a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast middle-stamps.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the players' arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play his style. All teams do not have central players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other trainers are so worried about meeting my team that they're going to get into something like this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think to meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the game between Storm and Roosters made more goals than when Broncos and Cowboys met.
The Broncos game was probably a good game.
Our game outcome was 20-18. Our game had more situations, but is it interesting football?
Or are game breakers and low-quality footballs interesting?
I think it's an interesting thing to do.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Stormi has a free weekend, because the team will be allowed to visit either North Queensland Cowboys Cronulls Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man is released against $200,000 bail in a drug case.
A man in charge of a 40 kilos [40 kg] cocaine shipment in Queensland has been released for life in exchange for $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by a police officer on a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo from the Solay ship, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the Coomera port in August.
The police were watching Maksimovic and his partner boating during the morning and two days later they were surprised by the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, and 40 kilos of the Toyota Echo car at the parking lot were found.
Although Maksmovicia may expect life-long possession of drugs for commercial purposes, according to a man’s lawyer, there is no evidence that his client has tried to get the whole batch under control, but he may have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
According to Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court, there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to escape the country.
"The maximovic has clearly connections to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", the judge stated in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
The mother and stepfather of Maksimovic paid 200 000 guarantees together, against which the man was released.
"When I read the oaths of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But it's not enough to stop a man from running," the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on condition that he will release both Australia and Serbia's passport, report to the police every day and stay home from 6 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Stepan Hogg used her phone to get her pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of children being exploited.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while sleeping and logged in to an online communications service where she received another user to send inappropriate images of children.
Later, after she woke up, she noticed that her phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she was recording the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five photos were reported to the police, and after they found computers in the address, the police found disturbing internet searches that used word search for unsatisfied child images.
Hogg claimed that he was trying to mislead the police on the Internet and that he had presented the police to scare the pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said at the local court at Dundee Sheriff's Court: "Mies claimed to be dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had done the graves on his computer, but claimed he had done so to present the police and thus be able to scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent him photos and who had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He told me that he received disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanting to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "After reading the messages from the phone, the girl cried out and cried to her mother."
She saw some inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl told me that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road acknowledged the allegations of the possession of inappropriate children last June. Hogg violated his bail on 25 January this year and refused access to the court hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed in the Register for Sexual Crimes, since it could be considered that the crime did not contain significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the declaration to October for social work background reports.
Mr Hogg was granted an exemption against guarantees in this case, but he was held under investigation on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the Register of Sexual Crimes before the day of the conviction.
Mr Robert Mugabe is making the wrong speech in Parliament
Mugabe, the oldest state leader in Africa, fell in the stairs leading up to the speaking height this year.
Mugabe did not hurt, but the video of what happened quickly spread on social media.
Parliament’s opening remarks were also contradicted by the allegations made by opposition legislators that they have received anonymous threats of killing, which warn Mugabe of being fascinated during his speech.
In the last month, the Members of Parliament took the floor on the situation of the President's state in the House, and took the same speech on Tuesday.
Bishop Innocent Gonese, MDC Party for Democratic Change, said that the text messages received by the seven opposition politicians, in which they are urged not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message title is "dead", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns recipients that there will be no more immunity from representatives outside Parliament.
The party led by Morgan Tsvangira is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings measures for business.
HP will be divided into two stock exchange companies later this year and will separate computer and printer business from growing business hardware and service activities.
According to the HP's announcement, the company records a one-off cost of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
"Restructures enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who runs the company after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company of current HP, and we have extensive and deep portfolio transactions that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"Our position as a company is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company focuses on its mission to provide unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
In the 1930s, the company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packardi, at Stanford University, is now divided into two.
Mass remodelling has been carried out in HP when the traditional desktop computers are moving to mobile devices.
The changes in HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and the largest technology companies in the United States, are the newest transfer in the sector, which believes that concentration will bring success.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal: The team must support injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well on the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to skip at least the next four British national teams.
The biggest trouble with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided strongly after the last season and seemed to have returned to its former steel under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
"The story didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It didn't have anything to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically it may be this way, but as Wengerk said, additional injuries can come when a player tries to return to the field between the season.
It shall also be possible to detect non-exhaustive conformity.
Premier Injuries Ltd list 23 different types of trouble since Wilshere debyted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal's ranks in 65 only a total of 157 league matches during the last five years.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, 6 out of eight season teams have been the second of the teams who lost money most because of their injuries.
Wenger accepts the possibility of a witch, but Arsenal believes that the injury statistics improved last season will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Even if a post-harvest return can be associated with a vulnerable period, which requires strengthening the body and applying for competitive powers", Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope that he will get his body balanced, and I believe in it, and his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal starts the Master's league on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team meets Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger prepares small changes in composition.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Artta are likely beginners.
Wenger can also put in a start-up meeting to replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the continuation of the F group, Maksimir Zagreb has the most scary stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated during 41 games for the team.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by a force of 3,2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth time in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson last year after he has gone to Monaco, and he is also motivated by a long-term hope of creating a team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"The title has not yet been hit by Arsenal.
On the other hand, we were very close in 2006 to being realistic with experience.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines in the absence of other series, especially when it is noted that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and that the suicide statistics of young men are up to 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) captures the problem by declaring the 2015 year of men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from applying for the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study interviewed 2,000 high school students, and according to the study, those suffering from depression are better off if there are enough healthy people around them.
The probability of the illness of unsymptomed persons was also halved if there were people nearby who did not have mental health problems.
But all things are based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Fast reaction is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
As a result of digitalization of life, the need seems strong, fun, and successful, even though isolation is a reality.
The values, money, image and social status associated with material success, all of which take attention to internal values and natural personal growth and friendship in our longings.
A millionaire in video games recently stated that money cannot really buy luck.
The fineness of the Frends was that the series turned the emphasis on the main stage.
Not one of the characters in the series was defined by the profession but by the personality. This was seen in friendship relationships.
In the series, Joey and Chandler were humorously introduced to hugging or watching football with their television chairs, and we often saw Ross wanting Rachel, and it was clear that men were able to relate to this even though they did not refrain from knowing fully.
One volunteer explained to me this way: "When I heard depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea of men being good is strong. The man is easily considered weak if he speaks of his problems."
"Frends are one of the series where long-term survival mechanisms are presented.
In a series of small moments of friendship between men was highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside as a moment of despair, but long-term support comes from friends and family around."
To honor Comedy Central FriendsFest, the series's sets have been raised to live, so if you participate this weekend, you might want to take your friends to the Central Perk.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
Never knows how important a friendship relationship can develop.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest to honor
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after the goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria managed to paint her too-deby of the Masters and helped the PSG to hit the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and estimate.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were under attack when Paris Saint-Germain began his work on the Master's league by hitting Malmön Parc des Princess on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French champions immediately at the service. However, PSG knocked out several goals before finally able to add a lead: Cavani painted after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish master. PSG is not just looking for a destination in the drop-off games, but also wants to improve its positions for the quarter-term in the three remaining matches.
Although the SPG caught points, the match was not the perfect show for Laurent Blanc's bulleted team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal - and the man had to change when he was in front of his former home club, where he started his huge career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in the guests' league, so the 2-0 victory and good extracts provide a good basis, even though we still have a disappointing season," Blanc said.
"This one knows good.
We wanted victory and we were able to do it, but it's a shame we couldn't get together or in two more lands."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he was injured. This weekend, the team had to be satisfied with the Ligue 1 series. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in her shadow at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine Latter who moved from Manchester United to PSG's lines was named PSG's solver, who raised the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of his reputation by thanking Marco Verratt's entrance to Malmö's defense and then shooting the exact target to the rear corner of Johan Wiland.
However, those awaiting the victory of the PSG had to be disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players on the field from the start. Five men's defense and two team playing with the attack on tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot went a little past Kevin Trapp's goal in the back of the game in 34th minute. The team didn't attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into futile feeding and poor finishing, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals only in the first half of the year. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic kicked the paint into the wigs of Cavani.
Ibrahimovic, however, showed his nails in the feed game. Di Maria shot the round-button over Wiland at 52 minutes.
Another goal was created at the time of the Kreiv. The male playing through the quack shot a full bullet when Ibrahimovic fed him the left winger at Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's letter ended in another goal, and only Wiland's peak battle at David Luigi's nearest distance had to be fired, and the goal of Ezequiel Lavez, from the exchange bench, was completely abandoned on the end of the forest.
Malmön set Åge Hareide subsequently admitted that PSG was in his own class. "We missed the previous Master's league game last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
I don't think that's enough.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"This was a top match for them."
Glencore collects a share of $2.5 billion
The Swiss miner Glencore, which was tested for the prices of raw materials, raised USD 2.5 billion in the share of the average week as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, stated in her opinion that he had sold new shares of some GBP 1.6 billion to reduce the debt.
The company's market value decreased by 57 per cent this year, and the company's pressured price deterioration of raw materials when the Chinese economy's recession hampers demand and burdens the market.
With a share, Glencore’s share price went down at the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 per cent in FTSE 100 index, which opened up to a increase of 0.69 per cent.
Glencore announced last week its intention to raise equity of USD 2.5 billion as part of the strategy to reduce its debt of USD 30 billion by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at 125 penny prices, which accounts for 2.4% of the closing price on Tuesday.
The company issued 1,3 billion shares with a combined value of up to 9,99 % of the total group.
The concern about the continuation of the Chinese economic downturn has led to a fall in iron ore prices by half, while the fall in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 and 40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The communication published on Tuesday at the White House confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will be visiting Washington on September 25th, when President Barack Obama visited Beijing last November.
After bilateral discussions with the Heads of State, the President of the United States and his wife, Michelle Obama, arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to honor the state visit.
"The visit by President Xi Jinping is an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral topics of interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity to discuss constructive topics which are subject to disagreement", says the White House Communication.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February and is expected to be in Seattle to meet several US leaders in the field of technology. From Seattle, the president's journey would first continue to Washington and from New York to the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber-vasing and the increased ground-based waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces the diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon was very keen to discuss with Effie Brown, African-American, and he said there was no need for diversification behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series presented on Sunday evening, the actor interrupted Brown, explaining how important it is to take account of the different views of the project’s master in the dark-haired script.
"The memory is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program," Damon claimed.

Damon and Brown were meeting with other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever is the director, I'd like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's figure is presented", Brown first said.
"The only dark-haired character is a prostitute who has sex with a white pimp."
The producer of the Dear White People film supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancacciata as director of the film, and Damon was proud to say that the choice of a twin could lead to an undesired outcome.
When the debate was held on television, social media exploded from Damon's bad comments.
The Twitter user, Mr.Pooni, expressed his anger at the scene in direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks on the only darker person to explain what diversity is is so white-looking that he hurts."
It was divided more than 5,000 times, and it's like 4,000 times.

"Albums still don't matter," he said.
"As with books and the lives of the dark-haired people, albums still matter."
The Black Lives Matter movement recently published an opinion in response to the question of the Fow News Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether that group should be described as an hate group.
"Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group", the management of the movement said.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media modules invited to the pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the western world.
It's not known if Damon responded to the invitation.
