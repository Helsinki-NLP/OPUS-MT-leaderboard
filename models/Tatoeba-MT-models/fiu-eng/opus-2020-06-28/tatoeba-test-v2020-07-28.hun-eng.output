Actually, he doesn't know anything about it.
Tom deserves to be free.
I'll come if the weather allows me.
He's got two dogs.
The innocence is a beautiful thing.
I barely know Tom.
There's no point comparing them.
He doesn't realize how important this meeting is.
We were both safe.
I don't have any money.
I think that would explain everything.
He's gone to eat.
It's not the same thing to say and act.
Talk to me.

I'm not home yet.
I'd trust him with my life.
It was hard at first.
I was embarrassed by what you said.
I don't know if that matters.
How was the traffic accident?

It's not that far.
There's a lot of schools in this town.
This town has a big TV station.

I found it in the attic.
Tom was waiting.
Look at you.
It's time to rest.
You explained the rule to me.
I rested.
I don't think this old building should be tartarized.

These are all mine.
He's not here yet.
He picked up his socks in reverse.
Elevator's not in the building. I can barely step up because of my sore knees.
That's enough!
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things, or destruction, and death is not conscious of anything; or, as they tell us, a real change: the movement of the soul from this place to another.
Don't sneak away.
That was a stupid question.
If you read the book, can you lend it to me?
If you'd stop telling me not to be nervous, I probably wouldn't be so nervous.
It's only natural.
What are you doing?
I'll put my passport back in the vault.
Tom felt it would be a waste of time to translate the letter to Mari.
He doesn't know anything about that animal.
Take care.

No one can live for 200 years.
She's calling me from time to time.
Something's not right.
Don't be prying.
I need a room near the elevator.

His fever's gone off.
He must be Tom's brother.
It was you, wasn't it?
Can you tell me the name of this man?
I'm looking for someone.
I can't see the forest from the tree.
Can you please talk a little more slowly, please?
I like green tea.
That was a tragic accident.
I don't count.
The rich will be more and more rich.
I don't have much time.
I have to go to the garden.

Bahai faith is a very cool religion.
270 years ago, Alessandro Volta, born on 18 February 1745, was born in Como, Italy.
Your new boy is black.
It's never accurate.
I tried to warn him.
They all cost the same thing?
I found it!
It's a big, fat lie.
They've been busy with this for hours.

We better go, Tom.
Probably could use some sleep for all of you.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat that.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds round the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I understand you?
He's in the kitchen.

But I don't have any iron.
I think you were right.
Where was the wedding?
I'm swimming in the river.

Let me know when you're ready.
Nothing's easier than talking.
Tom's down.
They died after each other.
I want you to read this book.

Tamás's a mathematician.
He was ashamed to have caused you trouble.
I'd still like to try.
Everyone was wrong.
That was Tom.
Do you know what we did?

I don't want to get used to that.
I'd rather die than surrender.
I don't have to.
Is it too late?
Choose between this or that, please.

Thanks, Mari, for never letting me lose.
He helped me cope with the difficulties.
That man is a gebe, but his wife is a cow.
What was inside?
I have friends.
Are you feeling better about your daughter?
Tom's not a high school student.
It was wrong of us to come here.
How big?

It was an amazing journey.
Stop it!
You're just wrong.
Tom's still following us.

I don't feed anger against you.
Her nose is completely different.
Their lives are a constant fear of life.
Is Tom ready?
I don't want to go.
How could you let Tomi do this?
It didn't hurt.
Tom didn't realize that Mari was unhappy.
Who was the first one here today?
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you.
You're the only one I need.
I'd like to say that one more time.
He's blind to one of his eyes.
I know one thing or another.
I would never have met you.
Are you afraid of rats?
Wouldn't you stay for tea?
Do you know where he lives?
Is it 12:45?
We're going on a trip.
It's as art as much as science.
My friend is obsessed with this.
Mari wants you to treat her like a queen.
I'm so glad you came back.

It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
Think hard.
Tamás was sitting nearby.
The plane was more than two hours late.
Where do you live in Turkey?
I didn't understand.
Mari's wearing earrings.
Do you know where we are?
She kissed me and then she left.
Show us the way.
The ground and the sun!
We won.
He's smuggled himself.
Ask Tom where Mari is.
This house is big.
I'd go to Mozi if I had time.
Why are we whispering?

I agree with Tom, too.
Are you with us, Tom?
Do you want to know what we've been fighting about?
Let's get to the point.
I want to know who's coming with us.
You don't have to do this to everyone.
Imports are subject to high taxes.
They're expecting first impressions.

This is my dog.
Let's hope it works.
Answer me, or I'll threaten you.
Where'd you get that?
Mary is my older daughter.
Tom continued his story.
A year smarter than I do.
Unfortunately, I was hoping for nothing.
I thought Tom would panic.
I know you're kidding.
I killed a pregnant mother!
You don't need money right now.
Why is it dangerous?
I'm not hungry.
Have you ever been to TV?
Look me in the eye.
Society is divided.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
Tom should have been a skeptic.
All of a sudden, Tom noticed that someone waved at him.
Tamás was afraid of Mary.
This song is great.
It's ours.
Tom did nothing but complain.
I just clicked a picture.
Tom doesn't have real friends.
Tamás's used to working.
He never existed.
Are you unhappy?
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
Tom asked me to help Mary.
We ordered too much food.
There's no doubt about it.

Winter's coming after the fall.
I didn't get anything.
Don't you even think about it?
Where did I put the sluss key?

Please make sure my room is aired while I'm out.
Did you talk to your wife?
They coughed.
I just can't stand not to smoke it.
Don't you want to show me something?
She was leaving to find her missing child.
We all know why.
I just don't want you to be offended.
I learned a lot from your books.
I prefer red.
Why didn't you tell me before?
The body is dead.
Tom told everyone he was sleepy.
That's chicken.
Tom retired in 2013.
It's hot.
I saw a UFO.
I don't like kids.
Who can you be?
I really like being alone.
It wasn't deliberate.
It'll be dark by the time we get home.
I was surprised to find out Tom was a French teacher earlier.
That would make sense.
We've got to paint the ring again.

He's not here right now.
Don't be so stupid.
He took her home.
I don't wish anyone dead.
He said he didn't know anything about it.
Can I go get some ice cream?
Did they hurt you?
I'll let Tom know.
I should have been more precise.
And how do you know that?
I want to see you.
He's a scientist.

I told him I'd do the best I can.
Looks like I don't need to be here.
I'd like something to eat.
Thank you for not saying "I told you so."
It's all back to normal cutting.

I know who he is.
I should have denied doing that.
Tom's gonna be really upset.
Why are you doing this now?
Shut up and do what they tell you.
What a great performance!
I can't drive a car.

I'm kind of tired.
I don't remember having ever been tired of work, even though nothing's going on.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
We compared Tom and Mary's work.
This is the new model.
Nobody left except Tom.
I'm not dead.
Do you know who said that?
We're exhausted.
He wants you dead.

We can't wait two weeks.
We'll come and visit you.
I named my daughter Nairu and wished her a long life.
How did you know Tom was going to Boston?
Tom never asked why.
Don't talk to him while he's driving.

This area should not be entered.
Tom should never have come back.
You don't have to scream.
Yes, she's our manager.
I'm not very hungry for a while.
That's better.
I missed her at school because she was sick.
Those roses aren't as nice as these.
She decided to take a red car.
Use your own money.
No one knows their names.
Let's trust you don't.
You're exhausted.
Who was watching?
I didn't steal it.
I'm sure Tom is found guilty.
Where are you, Karen?
Are you saying it's my fault?
Tom should have done it by now.
It's just a rumor.
