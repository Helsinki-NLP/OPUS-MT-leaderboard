European inflation slipped on food
Accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The increase in prices in November was higher than expected in 13 euro area countries, with 3.1 per cent of annual inflation recorded after 2.6 per cent in October - the statistics office of the Union in Luxembourg.
The official forecast is only 3 percent likely to have been reported by Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the base currency, unlike the US, the British and the Canadian ticket banks, saying that the reduction would lead to the creation of an inflation spiral with rising raw materials prices and unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep inflation rates close to two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is trapped in the twenty-two: "to speak" inflation so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of 3.3 percent of inflation in November is twelve years of record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1.
Euro-zone inflation has been hit high by rising food and energy prices.
The forward wheat notes increased by 88% and the soya beans exchange rate reached the highest value since 1973.
The cost of olive oil and dairy products was also significantly higher in 2007.
The world market price of petroleum increased by 52 percent this year, and last month almost $100 a barrel of black gold was costed.
According to the ECB, inflation jumps from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent this year in 2008, but in 2009 it falls to 1.9 per cent.
It is noted that the 12 monthly inflation rate remains around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB would reduce interest twice during 2008.
The Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support circle has grown significantly by early December, and has now had the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such low social support of 13 percent.
The difference between the Commissioners - because of the greater determination of the opponents - would mean more than two thirds (71 percent) of support against the one-fifth (20 percent) of MSZP support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZSZ are below Parliament's threshold: their support for the entire population is two per cent.
Among the members of the Commissioner's voter, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The economic public statement can continue to deteriorate to the previous point - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who have clearly considered the country's economic situation to be very bad, while 46% say that the situation is rather bad.
After a change in their own financial situation, families are now more pessimisticly judged after more hopeful prospects for spring and summer.
For the following year, the majority of the population will suffer further deterioration and only one tenth improvement.
In December more than any previous survey of the Gallup, 71 percent of those asked believed that the Prime Minister was wrong rather than doing his job well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the persons asked trust or trust very much, while at Viktor Orbán, 38 percent are supporters.
The Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent at all, 27 percent in Fidesz's president.
One indicator of the evolution of the political situation is how much society thinks it can be handled without change of government to the prime minister.
While 35 percent of the government and the Prime Minister were desired to remain in the wake of the disruptions last October, this rate is now only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees only the solution in writing new elections.
It is of interest to the referendum that 60 percent of those who have been asked answer the question of the intention to participate will answer that it would surely go away and another 20 percent say that it would probably be gone.
As a comparison, only 55 percent of the parliamentary elections to be held on Sunday would be present and another 15% would think they would be likely to participate.
For the tuitions, 74 for the people, 79 for the visit, and 84% for the hospital daily would say no.
If only we look at the same proportions among the promising people in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would take away the introduction of fees, fees and hospital fees.
The most expensive one in Auchan, raised the Tesco by almost five.
The hypermarkets held an average increase of 16 per cent last year in the Budaörs trade triangle, with the difference that this year the VAT did not rise.
The Day Economy article
This year, on average, there was an average increase of 16 percent on the daily Christmas basket at the Budaörsi commercial triangle, but in each hypermarket there was an increase over a thousand forints in value.
Since in December last year the prices in the food stores have been "responsible", so a percentage of the former high base has not been shown to be a dramatic flowering.
However, it is clearly frightening for consumers that what they could have received in a good nine thousand HUF last year, they cannot get to it for even ten thousand.
The sun basket in the hypermarkets under examination has reached the limit of tens of thousands of forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value was 10 573 forints.
(The basket cost 6800 in 2003).
The price of Unicum and living fish almost stayed on last year's level, but the turkey juice, nut and honey were very expensive too.
KSH data was followed in stores by flour and bread prices, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 Forints.
Competition did not depress the product price below 200 Forints.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre replaceable bottle Coca-Cola was 200 forints, so they requested only 257 HUF for the product together with the deposit fee.
However, this year, Auchan appeared to the most expensive, while Cora appeared to the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora 15, compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the Sun basket by about 18-18 percent.
The difference between last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket value was 12 per cent, while the most expensive one in last year's growth was 21 per cent.
The average increase in Forint was 1480.
Last year the average price increase was 1206 forints, with last Christmas feeling influenced by the prices of VAT increases.
It was precisely this process that scattered trade, apparently not being able to determine the price level for a single product, because they were unable to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If a product is badly designed by the trader, it may be of serious benefit to the price adjusted for traffic intensity.)
Because of the VAT last year, the price increase of the Day basket was so extreme that the most expensive 1720 HUF was more than the 2006 value, while only 844 HUF was the difference.
This year, this extremism did not show, as the most expensive 1630 forints today were more than last year, and the most expensive was also 1284 forints.
Compared with the two Christmas seasons, there was a disastrous price increase, which over 30 per cent of the total daily consumption in the hypermarkets over 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: the statistical agency has a price increase of more than 30 per cent over a period of 12 months for some basic foods.
For example, in addition to flour, eggs.)
According to the Sun basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since last year, the price level of the product is quite expensive compared to the base, in the worst case, it has produced a price increase of just over 10%.
List suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than eggmen, a dramatic price increase has been able to cross on multiples.
In the gold triangle trade, the hyper will not complain, they will keep reporting about a good year.
In our experience, in the three shops we visited, a lot of customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they carry plastic for long-term food.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores developed serious lines before the cash prices because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that there are fewer traffic in the countryside, a number of complaints to research firms that even their plans are missing revenue, and not only for food, but also for durable consumer goods.
They save in many places on antibiotics
More than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals this year, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the congestion of beds, the overburdening of staff do not favour the stopping of infections, the head doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They save in many places on the antibiotics.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma class of the János Hospital.
In a man after a major accident, bacteria resistant to antibiotics were detected.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the same year.
He was released from the hospital for a serious car accident, but shortly later, he had to return with MRSA infection, and no major surgery has been possible since due to the bacteria in his system.
By December 10, 1994, hospital infection caused by multi-resistent pathogens was reported to the National Nosocomial Survey System, said the head doctor of the National Epidemiological Centre, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that so many multi-resistent pathogens have definitely been registered in hospitals, and the rest are not known.
Approximately two-thirds (683 infections) of the infections were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxocillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are carried by a third of humans in their nose without causing disease.
The infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, mandula, skin infections, infection) react well to antibiotics, which can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are used to an excessive extent or not properly, a highly resistant bacteria from the bacteria that responds to antibiotics, which spread rapidly under inadequate medical conditions, is developing.
Primaryly, the immune system may cause serious hospital infections, such as infection or blood poisoning, in patients with a weak body, elderly or small body weight, at temporary or persistently poor functioning.
According to the medical director at the János Hospital, MRSA infection has nothing special, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be mixed with the walk, MRSA is not there only, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not examined.
Antibiotics resisting
"We separate such patients, the care staff sees the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients entering the hospital will be examined for the presence of MRSA in their body, but this cannot always prevent infection.
No fashion for sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, but current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to preventing the development and spread of multi-resistent pathogens, says Böröcz Karolina.
Once this infection occurs typically in hospitals, hospitals should monitor incoming patients, and patients carrying MRSA should be immediately separated.
However, there is no microbiological sampling in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these tests.
Most of the cases thus arise when the patient becomes infected with MRSA, said the head doctor of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
The aim should be to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that microbiological testing should be carried out in order not to develop resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always comply with it.
Microbiological samples are even less common in outpatient or basic care, reported Karolina Böröcz.
I'm saving on the antibiotics.
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted by healthcare personnel from one patient to another.
Therefore, handwashing, gloves, masking, has a very important role to play, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA spreads with detonation and contact, but in domestic hospital conditions, it is not always possible to separate the infected patient.
In fact, hospitals are often strangled, often very close to each other, and patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart from each other from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, even the experienced, Böröcz Karolina noted that in disadvantaged hospitals, they save on antibiotics, few are nurses, many patients, so there is even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are observed, there is an evidence that such infection is reduced, or that further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection brings enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are fighting everywhere.
In England, for example, it included a reduction in the prevention or occurrence of MRSA in the Government Programme.
It appears that the programme is successful, based on the data reported, would show a decreasing trend of MRSA infections in England.
Among the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include prevention of multi-resistent pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
You weren't drunk, chief of police, causing the death accident.
The opinion of the official experts on the fatal accident caused by the XXII police chief was prepared.
There is no way that he or she would have led to his post drunk or corrupt in time to resign from the XXII district police captain who was driving a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the capital office on Friday after the expert opinion had been drawn up on this matter.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which has already established that the former police captain had not consumed alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
On Tuesday the 55-year-old man who was not going to the other side of the road on the designated pedestrian's side of the road was hit by the driver of the 21st district division with his own passenger car.
(The latter, so that the pedestrian does not pass through the zebra, the circumstances which are otherwise not mitigating under the KRESZ rules, still have to give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after he was taken to the hospital.
As a result of what happened, the district chief resigned from his post and asked him to take his seat, according to the police, because he was so shocked by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former chief of police had been working with investigating prosecutors from the beginning.
A further €400 million for infrastructure
Three loans agreements in favour of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy were signed by János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which 100 million credit contracts have been concluded by the parties in the past, and the agreement signed is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The Education-related projects also provide budget financing for the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, using the remaining EUR 150 million later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a €50 million contract, which is primarily used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
We talked about subway number four at the meeting.
It was agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the funding of the metro with the EU, it will return to whether and how the original agreement should be amended.
According to János Veres, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The loans shall be provided by the EIB without a maturity of 8 years and without any maintenance commission.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate haven
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the whole of Europe is looking at a few Balkan countries mentioned earlier.
What, where and who are still buying in the EU's cheapest yet fast-flavoured market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most up-to-date real estate destination in Eastern Europe is Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most popular areas of Bansko, Borovic, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and Albena, "Aranypart", "Napospart", ancient Szobopol and Neszebar, but more and more people are looking for properties in Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will bring an interest to investors - so Veliko Tarnonono, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will also buy in the very cheap Rusz area.
The capital, Sofia also offers attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so that, along with the summer and winter season, the other should be a priority for the other two seasons.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already buying large quantities, for example, around Bansko.
According to the analysts, purchasing properties in Bulgaria are also trying to change their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Malta's and Cyprus's investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and Ski Paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The depositors or refurbished properties will be bought between €50 and €100,000, or the house will be refurbished for €5-15,000 and then renovated.
It requires good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a large city, shops, and the local doctor’s proximity in general.
The second category is for the holiday shoppers (Bulgaria was added to the first 10 German tourist destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of an increase in medium or long term value.
The dwindling of capital properties is continuing, as demand is increasing.
In Bulgaria, the lowest real estate prices in the European Union were, but in the last five years, they increased by 21% per year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially above the increase in wages.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
According to information provided by the Minister for the Environment and Water, the meetings of experts will be completed on Tuesday, and after the official opening on Wednesday, the negotiations of ministers will continue to take place following the 2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there is a fierce debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not want to discuss precise figures at present, although it tends to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question is whether developed countries will also undertake to provide financial and technological assistance to the countries in need, while reducing emissions.
There was also an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The grant fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a Management Board of 16 members, expected to be available within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) in the Market and Profit.
Six per cent of Hungary
Mr Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain the flagship's role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will undertake to reduce 20% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to reduce up to 30% if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to commit themselves to their respective responsibilities and capabilities.
In 1997, Gabriel Fodor pointed out that a total reduction of 5.2% was made in the Kyoto Protocol, including a further 15 EU Member States - a minus 8%.
The obligation in Hungary is 6% greenhouse gas emission reductions compared to the 1985-87 period, which our country will perform. - reminds the Ministry of Environment of the press release.
The stake in Balin is high, as it will have to be covered by the long-term international climate policy agreement within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly take place after 2012.In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow the new international emission reduction system, the need for which was highlighted in its latest report by the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize, the International Panel on Climate Change.
This would result in a delay and inevitable increase in average Earth temperature over 2 degrees of Celcius, which scientists believe would have with extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
On YouTube, the British army recruits
recordings of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are being published on the video distribution by the British army units that promote themselves.
For the first time, the British Air Force (RAF) received YouTube: special developments in Afghanistan have been videoting on their action against the Taliban since March 2006 - announced the BBC.
These miniature footage with helmet-mounted cameras will be checked in the Air Force Commander's Command and then sent to London, where the natives will upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
The air force soldiers have already received 139 recordings on the Internet in this form, and their "channel" has been watched for over 75 thousand.
The British Ministry of Defence, registered in the spring of 2007 as "defenceheadquarters", publishes videos of actions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of National Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi international peacekeeping missions (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Introduction in Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's original intention to recruit videos, and according to the Ministry of Defence, this is also a good idea for the public to know the real purpose of the military's foreign presence.
The propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to the traditional television recruitment reports - said the BBC's defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - but it is tediously carrying some political message, since it can demonstrate the existence of military actions decided by the government in its own form.
The Americans played a game
In addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, it is also a problem for the military to be released by amateur videos, which, for example, also show the death of soldiers: in the somewhat picturesque, "official" propaganda films, the officers speak up about losses, but do not present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos of the Iraqi and Afghan Navy have already been released on the Internet, which is prepared for sharp deployments, but the British army has only recently received it.
Americans recruit a little different, free downloadable game called America's Army, in which the player can hide directly into the soldiers' skin in the context of a more or less life-long simulation.
It's going to be a big Christmas for the ministries.
Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika does not seem sensitive: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold an annual workshop with his colleagues, who will be able to thank him for his poppy and coffee from 2007.
There's a department where there's a live music party, and there's a lot of tumbolism and cots and a Christmas mood in the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and a buffet - so have power.
The state agencies are preparing for Christmas.
The largest fashioned Ministry Christmas party is held this year by the national defence wallet, but the HM is not waiting for the department staff.
On Christmas Eve, the children of fallen soldiers receive a gift, visiting the family of soldiers at the Mission Christmas, currently serving at foreign missions, but also organising a press conference.
The wallet is 25 million for the final mood of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GM) are fired from the Ham compared to the other wallets.
The GKM party is held at the Future House, with a total of 4 320 000 HUF, and about three hundred and fifty guests from the Six hundred Ministry staff.
They'll stick to the Christmas mood at the party of the wallet, but they'll be grounded and dusted.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF, and there were concerts and dinners on Wednesday at the National Justice Council (OIT).
The room rental cost a million HUF, the remaining part was spent on more than 400 invited.
We also know that one of the NFÜ's departments is official for another Christmas celebration: this is arranged by a tender management company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development, from EU money.
The building was rented for the purpose.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the competent authority.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building saw not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which organized Luca Day's prom on December 7, instead of Christmas.
They didn't ask for money to use the OIT's room.
500 people attended the prom.
The party went off with the minister's welcome, and he could dance for a live music after dinner.
The question of [orgo] was said: the ball was not mandatory at all in the evening dress or suit.
Puritan's having a party with the Health, Labour and Municipalities.
The Ministry of Health organises a programme and a celebration for workers for 400 000 forints in its own building.
On the other hand, Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika is officially not waiting for a Christmas party, but is waiting for his colleagues at the end of the year.
A hundred guests, who have reported the press class, will only receive coffee and bourbon, so they will take the party out of 350 000 forints.
However, Minister of Government of Bajnai Gordon will simply be jogging with his colleagues at the office of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas meeting in its own large room, for which 436 workers are expected.
There are 2500 forints per guest for the Christmas party - the amount of a Swedish-based bet and a cocktail fit.
Since János Veres is the minister, the employees of the PM are like Christmas each year.
But it won't, it's not just the ministerial speech that strengthens the officiality, it's also the afternoon time.
The agricultural register will give you a new annual bet on 20 January, the Ministry will miss Christmas.
The bet is held in Vajdahunyadvár, the City League, and according to the wallet, there are 1,000 forints per 100 guests per head.
This - according to the press class - will be a very simple standing reception, which only foreign diplomas accredited for Hungary will be official.
These bets each year start with short ministerial greetings and finish with renditions.
At all, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture did not hold a Christmas party with [orgo] in the competent press departments.
They couldn't tell us the price of the official Christmas of the environmental wallet in the press department.
In any case, more than four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are growing
On Friday, the National Association of Trade Unions and Works Councils will be formed by their strike committee coordinating Monday, undecided time strike.
On Monday, on the day of the final vote on the health insurance law, the protesting General Meeting will begin.
The operation will certainly cause a significant increase in traffic, as rail transport will almost completely stop and they will strike for 13 hours at BKV.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions presented details of their Monday strike organised jointly with the National Labour Councils Association.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, which will coordinate Monday’s action.
On Saturday, the protesting General Assembly will be held, and from Monday, organisations joining the strike will cease their work for an indefinite period if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been designated - on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act - the date on which the strike began.
If Parliament did not accept the Health Insurance Act, trade unions would immediately withdraw the strike call.
If, on the other hand, the legislation is voted, the strike committees will come together and decide on the continuation.
On the Monday's agenda of the Parliament, it is possible that only late hours, or maybe night hours, of the Health Insurance Act, will be voted on.
As a result of the strike starting on Monday, there can be significant increases in transport: the work will be completed at the railways for an indefinite period, and a part of public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volán companies will be able to stop before the morning.
At the same time, there will be a semi-circular roadblock on several points in the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, and these lists are updated on League's hour.
Some organisations have declared a strike for an indefinite period, others have announced a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the free trade union of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZZ) could not agree on enough service, but more and more travel on the railway along the way to Christmas holidays.
According to the latest announcements, there will be a four-hour strike at BKV, Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., between 7 a.m. and 7 a.m., between 4 a.m., between the LIGA Electricity and Heat Trade Unions, 2 and 2 to 8 hours of work stop by the Pedagogical Trade Organisation of Pedagogians and the Pedagogical Trade Organisation of Pedagogians.
The Hungarian Medical Association is a country-wide two-hour warning strike by the SZEF Health and Social Affairs Association (EDDSZ).
The four claims put forward by the League are essential that the government withdraws the proposal for reform of health insurance and submits a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim is to gradually introduce a new method for calculating pensions due next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement is possible before 2010 in the case of work placements.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers belonging to the Liga Trade Union (VDSZZZ) does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport of Railway Lines and expects other offers.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Gárda, founded in August this year, supported by Jobbik Hungary, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the region according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
The company's 'risk warning' was written that, in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Gárda, there is the greatest political risk that 'in the short term, there could be violent ethnic conflicts, even if the ethnic tension between the Hungarian Gypsy and the non-cigány population was to deepen itself in the short term'.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Gárda is likely to be aimed at promoting such an act - the research institute added.
As it has been written, this can be attributed to one of the main failings of the Hungarian political players: "The public debate on Roma issues has been handed over to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings who have built a political strategy against the Hungarian Gyány-Hungarian".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the Research Institute, the activities of the Hungarian Gárda have been "in the light of the great domestic and international media observation" "in the context of the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of country stability and the belief in democratic development".
It is recalled that, since the autumn of 2006, an increasingly public and active role of radical and extreme-right groups in Hungary has become part of the resumption of more organisations called "national self-defence" from summer 2007, which have been established in Hungary as a "national self-defence" association.
"The common feature of these conflicts is to define themselves as a civil society organisation, while their members, whether armed, are openly declared to be involved in the defence tasks of the police, the military, or the state's incompetence".
It has been noted that this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to put different political ambitions in civil circles based on social policy and neutrality.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association are therefore not merely intended to avoid the legal failures of court registration for these associations, but also to avoid a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, there are potential threats in several neighbouring countries to the Hungarian Gárda and the ultra-nationalist political players in certain neighbouring countries are seeking to demonstrate their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Gárda.
This has had an impact on the political stability of the region".
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
As it was written, the operation of the Hungarian Gárda is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union for the People's Right (BNU).
The background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in one quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has made use of this to establish a reserve, saying that the organization aims at "national self-defense".
In the past 17 years, they believe that Bulgaria has been experiencing a "cigity terror", but the state remains an absolute and indifferent one - reminds the Political Capital.
They added: the initiative created a serious debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been written, an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts indicates that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that resistance is likely to create their own Guard.
Since the Hungarian Gárda has so far shown similarity to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Roma in Hungary are similarly responding to the threat by organising their own self-defense - you can read the political Capital Risk Warning.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said of the interests of the telematic office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, they issue a risk assessment every year, and if they experience a risk assessment that could have an impact on a change in risk, they will inform the public as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
It's not all red in the sky. It's a holiday.
In Hungary, the law accurately defines red spelling days, and around the holidays it has become a general practice for a working day arrangement, which will be less than it will be next year.
In the EU and America, the celebration is not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and holidays.
Working break days can mostly be linked to church holidays, marked historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last and the first day of the Old Year - the latter is only to allow the New Year to rest.
We've got a total of eleven red spells all year round.
The National Day is also the Memorial of March 15th, 1848, and October 23rd, 1956.
On 20 August we celebrate the start of the state, on 1 May we celebrate the work, and we remember our deceased relatives, friends, who died on 1 and 2 November.
In addition, we have a two-day celebration of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely rain for the weekend according to the calendar, working days have become practical in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that on previous Saturdays we will not be away from work and school.
The fact that the day immediately preceding or following the celebration has to be processed at exactly when has long been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and employees, public employees and those in public service law.
However, it does not affect companies and institutions operating on break-in days, without interruption and its purpose.
This year, only around the end of the year's holidays, the working order is changed: from 24 December to 24 December, life stops in the country, because experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year are "slapped" by the majority of people, or that they use their saved freedom for that purpose.
Next year we will have more holidays at the middle of the week or the end, so there will be fewer working day placements than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the work holiday so that the workers can stay at home for four days, depending on the same time.
It'll be Saturday's Saturday day on April 26 so that it can take place on Friday's break day of May 2.
The other transfer is due to the 23rd of October: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work instead of the 24th Friday.
However, the end of the year can come to a full future, as from 24 December, there will be a nonstop break everywhere even if it comes to Wednesday.
It's six very small things to piss your colleagues off.
E-mails that we forget to send are voice mail messages that we never get, innocent lies that we almost don't even notice: these are "colored" every day at work.
The question is, do you get used to the minor inconveniences or pick up the gloves and consciously avoid misunderstandings that cause revenge to others?
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to let you know that you were looking for a marketing department" is a colleague of yours.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret and try to make amends, perhaps call the marketing class to tell you you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, it's taken care of with an apology.
Before you get awkwardly excused, you should think about what it is you can get your colleagues to take unpleasant moments to make a conscious effort to avoid this.
Can you borrow something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more annoying than touching for a document, office or phone, and that's nowhere else.
Remember you put your fire engine on the table yesterday, but it was on foot by morning?
Would you cover your pen as lost on one of your colleagues' desks?
Without a request, do not take anything from your colleagues because they will rightly be angry with you to ride their property.
Don't take your pockets from the office envelopes, post-mails, because it may be unpleasant if you run out of time, and you need it right away.
Are you gossiping about my colleagues' personal life?
There is no good way to stop the rumors that are spreading.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Don't touch everyone's nose about the privacy of your colleagues.
If one of them shares your innermost secrets with you, don't live with your trust.
Bury the people you hear, and in your absence, do not discuss your colleagues, even if others know about your colleagues' affairs.
Are you an innocent patient?
When you call in the office, and refer to a headache that makes you sick, because you feel bad or you feel that you would rather rest that day; think of your work, your inexplicable work, your regular work, you have to do for someone else.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know that you're not going to go to the office the next day, or if there's anything you need to stay home for, tell your colleagues and your boss not to face your absence the next day.
Disgusting, whining, phone calls
Did you have a crush on the job, but that's where my colleagues' whistles are?
You've become an unscrupulous listener for a phone call that you wouldn't have heard?
Do not interfere with your colleagues’ swelling, singing, loud conversation (which you continue above their heads) or with your feet, constant commuting, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they do not actually fall into one project (in writing, planning, organisation).
Are you blaming others for their mistakes?
If you don't have time, you forgot to send me an important letter, a message, and don't blame yourself for your forgetfulness.
Don't mention any chaos or chaos in the office, your loud colleagues.
Just admit it if you're wrong, and that's where someone else comes from and eliminates the horn.
Ask him how to make up for your mistake, make up for the failure.
Do you feel too comfortable in the office?
Maccots and slippers: comfortable to wear for home, but it's not for the office!
Don't get comfortable out-of-time suits if your job environment allows you to do it.
Don't be slamps, colleagues, and respect yourself by wearing regular clothes - if your job requires you to go into the office in a nice, elegant way.
If you want to answer, you're not interested anymore.
The car's a hit in the usual morning jam.
There's a special song on the radio that's called a violin that's connected to electronic effects.
I'm gonna roll up the volume.
The music has become a pace, and the bass is arriving next to the sound levels of the past, and then the female choir as the real jewelry is connected.
The number of Zagar Wings of Love on mr2.
For a long time, Hungarian musical life has made us less comfortable with high-quality electronic pops.
But now it looks like the whole thing's different when you're listening to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some new and exciting productions coming from the Hungarian digital underground, slowly changing the picture, and even though fashioned again by the guitar picker garage rock, the Hungarian electrop also proves: there is new under the Sun.
Zságer started from Balázs Pecs, and he played himself in Yonderboi's band until - maybe, because two of them didn't fit in a barn - he took his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines jazz, electronic dances, pop elements, but it started to break when filmed soundtracks were requested (e.g.
Ferenc Török).
His formations in smaller clubs were presented by a wider audience when he first recorded his album in 2002 among the 50 most important Hungarian albums, and in the company of Yonderboi, Zagar was declared to be almost single, marketable Hungarian trenders on the west.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and the band became "trend", but, of course, no one asked if they would like to wear the label.
The band responded as it should: it made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new ways for them, although the address itself wishes to create continuity with the early pecsic years.
This is because Balázs Zságer was one of his old orchestras.
We would be in place with an airy, flying reference, but in addition to the airliness of music, it has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit and trend of the age - the effects of the louder guitar, the rock and roll.
In these songs, the album’s premier in Millennium was presented by the singer, György Ligeti, currently working with The Puzzle Orchestra in England.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and until late morning, Mr.2 Petőfi began smuggled into the ears with the six Hungarian singer ("Underground Divas") recorded Wings of Love.
So everything's okay (?).
The phg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
phg.hu: This new hitger is now asking how much is left of the layer music that you play?
Zságer Balázs: The definition of a layer music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two types of light music cast; not Mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commers and honest.
The so-called alternative underground music can also be flat, non-sounding, and likewise prepare for mere sale, which makes them more complex.
But a good pop can come from being honest.
Your host attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
Zs.B.: There are bigger traditions of light music abroad, especially west of us.
It's not just the 12th-year-olds who go to concerts, it's the older ones.
They are much more concerned with the light music changes around them, because they are also considered to be part of contemporary culture.
phg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good to have more and more of our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Our music is born for no purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen in concerts where it already works for each other, but it is only in the faceless changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that if you want to answer to the audience, you're not interested anymore.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working on a solo, and he's built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path, no matter how sometimes they try to explain it to our music.
We're more like team players who trust in the presence of the other music and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that we were likened to Yonderboi’s music, for many of us have come out of his band and left another way.
phg.hu: On the top list of Mr2 Petőfi, Wings of Love was the first place.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in relation to this number.
Did you knowing that you opened with a more popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and sell the record.
This song is more than that.
We wanted it to be the finale of the album, which we tried to remove the tone of the album and the more difficult topics.
phg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why the hell were they - what was the lead?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when the idea came to make this choir out of our own Hungarian music scene's sound soloists.
This is how the six - member choir, i.e. Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judith Jay, Péterfy Boris, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], German Juci, was baptized to Underground Divas.
phg.hu: Did the song just be designed or formed by girls?
Zs.B.: The number has long been in the instrument version, and then when the record material came together, we thought we needed something else for this song.
The turnout drew me to get my voice on it.
That night I sang the song that girls later learned.
Almost first and scaryly spontaneously, it all came.
I remember it was very exciting back then, but of course, the Divad needed it.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
phg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert seemed to be in the background of the girls.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), no one's own role, they're all singing together, and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just follow their singing.
They were on the stage too.
Is that deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were back was merely due to technical problems.
But it's conscious that we didn't want to share solo roles.
And that's what the number is about to forget about our ego, how it came from, let's just let those wings, the wings of love raise us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
phg.hu: Which was most work with?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creative processes were more difficult than mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play in a tournament piano, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where you didn't want to work for a long time, and then it was nice and easy, like in a puzzle game.
phg.hu: What is your favorite number of the new album?
Zs.B.: This is always changing with the concert and the "l've let the record down".
Now the Prophet Is the Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
The traitor risked billions due to a minority feeling
It's unreligious.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French banker of Societe Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was not at all talented rather than just a big player trying to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He has reduced intellectual capacity," he said to the police officers who informed him.
However, as France's Le Monde reported, Kerviel's statement shows, at the end of the year, he earned EUR 1.6 billion in profits from his businesses.
Poverty not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In summer, the U.S. crisis managed to earn half a billion euros.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, news has appeared that there will be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for low incomes or customers with past cancellation problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and he put me on a good horse.
The final profit of the year reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I was looking for the first half billion, I didn't know how to report it," admits Kerviel and adds that you didn't keep anything.
In his confession, he admits that he faked his reports so that he wouldn't be able to find out.
Even when Eurex's stock exchange became interested in his dealings.
The risk was profitable.
Were you afraid to find out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought it was just the fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would calm them down."
Where did he have the will to risk that much?
He achieved his position gradually.
After the completion of the lyon university, he worked at the Societe Générale bank from 2000.
His annual salary moved around 51,000 dollars.
Two years later, he was a brokerage assistant, and he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000 in 2005.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, in my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with a bad eye.
He also said to the detectives about my destiny, professional and personal development.
After his entry, the first great success came very soon.
He was looking for allianz's shares, as he put half a billion euros to the fall of these shares in London during the bombings.
And that's what started Lavina. She wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," said the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know everything, or they'd rather suspect it.
"While I made money, they lost eyes."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
He wanted to shower in the middle of January this weekend.
When he started work Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
She became suspicious about her freedom.
"I only took four days last year.
The broker who has no freedom, the broker who doesn't want anyone to look at his reports," finished with Kerviel.
Czech Republic is likely to acquire 365 billion
The Czech Government's ministers signed nine operational programmes with the representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could raise EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount available by the Czech Republic in Brussels from 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes in the regions cost some 125 billion.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most money, 150 billion crowns, is directed at transport.
The Transport Programme represents the largest operational programme and 22 percent of the funds available from the Funds for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base for transport infrastructure, which will be managed by 90,8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to gain tools for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also receive resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient methods of organisation.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries within the framework of the newly adopted countries to win funds from the EU funds.
Nicaragua's ex-President's 20-year prison sentence was approved by the court
On Thursday, the Nicaragua Appeal Court approved 20 years' imprisonment for Arnold Alemán, the former president of the country, to which in 2003 100 million dollars (up to 1.8 billion people) were sentenced.
Later, though, he was released from prison and was house arrest in his Hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former head of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will once again be brought back behind bars, according to the AP news agency, it is not clear yet.
The President of the Board of Appeal, Ileana Perez, will depend on the head of the prison to leave Alemán's sentence at home or to go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that government funds were regularly referred to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These Fit companies and their account numbers were actually related and closest supporters.
Some of these funds were then implemented by the Foundation, which was set up to finance Alemán's election campaign in 2001.
They've approved our budget.
That's right.
They took the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget adopted by the coalition, without support from the opposition, by this government.
This year last year, it was with the support of the Social Democrats, since Minister Sobotka and the Czech Socialist Party could not accept it.
No drama happened this time, unlike a debate on mistrust with the government before the vote.
The House has generally ignored this legislation, even though it has failed to comply with the most effective law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends in each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the power of the government and the opposition.
It's more grateful in the press, so you get a lot more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the State Social Democrats in the past have been struggling with three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget will not be able to resolve at the same time:
The first of them is a high proportion of the law on compulsory, so-called trustee expenditure, which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by ČSSD and KSČM's silent 'coality' before the elections.
The second is as a result of the first failure in the management of the deficit.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the budgets of cities and flights.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
This is under public and relative control.
Timed bombs are the budgetary deficits of cities and flights.
Many mayors can make money not only from taxes, taxes and bank loans but also for other investments, often issued bonds that their townshouses have been disproportionately sold.
In recent years, these debts have been cancelled by the massive sale of shares in the energy and other distribution networks received from the State from privatisations.
They don't have that kind of source anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase, with which the Czech Socialist Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for the governments to improve public funding.
Instead, the country became more and more driven into debt.
The other countries managed with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, far more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is primarily a huge shame for former governments.
We belong to countries that are at least at risk of poverty at global level.
For example, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, in recent years have gone up in a gigant way.
Although this year it has been possible to eliminate this part of the pointless populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if it does not take place in the near future to bring the retirement and pension reform to an end, any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever will rule, it will be an officialisation.
A small excess can be said that the majority of the money taxed from the governor's politicians tend to be pensioned and social benefits become mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year's budget must not be a revolution, but can only stop the reduction of normal expenditure by the sponsor's expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be totally unnecessary if the former governments had not recovered everything they could have done over the last decade.
If we do not want to become mere officials of the governor's politicians, then we must be patient and be calm in preparing for further reforms, this is not too strong for the coalition government that is aware that the state will only give out as much as it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
Only this will allow a gradual achievement of a balanced budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks are trying to solve the crisis.
The central banks of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight jointly against the crisis in the financial markets.
Money markets cost hundreds of billions of dollars through stock exchanges.
On this stock market, the bank increases interest rates for which they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed gives 40 billion dollars to the stock exchange and makes twenty-four more available to the European and Swiss central bank.
After the eleventh attacks of September, it is the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed in a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of free capital that banks could lend," said Bernard Baumohl, an advisory firm of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated operation of central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65% to about 50 percent," added Baumohl.
In the United States, banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of non-repaid loans.
They're going to expect another billion losses.
"Credit banks can really fear what might happen if they decided to do so," says Kieran Davies, General Manager of ABN Amro.
It looks like it's really bad," he did.
Central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves can access the loans themselves, they will lend their customers more expensively.
This would reduce the need and put the American economy into recession with the potential consequences of global economic growth.
The central banks have decided that LIBOR, the LIBOR interbank supply interest rate reduction, which is used for money lending in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual borrowing, even though central banks in the USA, Canada and Great Britain had reduced their interest rates a few times during the fall.
"There will be a similar effect to this further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the step taken by central banks contributes to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve the fundamental problem, the fall in the US real estate market.
Klaus: An incredible discussion of ecologists
Global climate change is the greatest threat to developing countries.
President Klaus again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticised the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
The book The Blue in Vienna, not the green planet, has made the discussions of the ecologists incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a specific mixture of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also a fundamental difference between its accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate there absolutely lacks the structure, it is only by words throwing, which complements the solution of the current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important for him and that he was so committed to this topic.
He expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book was also published in German, as he said, "I often only meet my opinion on caricatures."
So now the interested parties can read their unbridled opinion.
Klaus recalled that although not a climatologist, he considered that he had sufficient ground to write such a book.
Since you have been able to follow professional findings and judge as academics in your statistics and also as a economist.
At the end of the book, all scientists believe that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so there is no danger, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, the perception of unproved opinions to others is unacceptable, which is perceived as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
To the questions that are present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against proper environmental protection, but against militant envirometalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus already spoke about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousands were unable to exchange their licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to exchange their old license in time, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last time you can still apply for the exchange, that the offices can issue a new licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that, after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers would leave without valid driving rights.
According to the offices, the license was not primarily replaced by those who no longer want to drive.
While the flights represent a sharp fall in interest in the exchange of rights, the capital offices have been flooded with applications for the exchange of rights, for which interest has grown this week.
The Mayor's Office receives about 2,000 clients a day.
It's about half an hour in line.
In Prague, some 150,000 drivers have not replaced the licence.
A new license will last for 20 days.
However, a new licence may also be required by a five-day shorter period.
In such a case, however, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 crown.
Drivers who cannot make compulsory licenses by the end of the year and who are on their way with invalid rights are being punished from January to January.
The sinner has to pay up two thousand crowns.
However, the police can arrange for an exorcism.
In the case of public administration exclusion, the penalty is 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information from the city hall, you can also get a fine that doesn't travel anywhere.
They say you can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called on the offices to be looked at and fined for up to a thousand crowns.
According to the Minister for Transport, however, many tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
He believes that a license is a document in which people can decide whether or not.
This is not an identity card that should be valid for everyone.
Those of you who don't want to drive should resign from the license.
Enough to take it or send it to the appropriate office.
By the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 no longer apply.
However, drivers must gradually replace other types of licence.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can change them for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million further documents.
The court has reduced the punishment of detectives co-ordinated with Berdycchel.
Josef Opava and Petr Kořařík were police officers who were suspected of meeting David Berdych's crime group and were sentenced to thirteen and ten years of prison.
The Supreme Court in Prague has determined to reduce their penalties for one year and two years.
Detectives of the Prague Organized Crime Division were originally threatened by 14 and 12 years of prison.
There is no longer any appeal against today's decision, a review may be applied only to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in this case, it is only for the first time judgment.
In other proceedings, more than 16 years have already been punished.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found primarily 19 people to be guilty of robbery, of which the Supreme Court today discussed 16 appeals.
Most of the defendants rejected the allegations from the start of the investigation by referring to speculation.
According to the Central Czech Senate, after an agreement with Bertycs, not only had the criminals been reported from police sources, they covered certain robbery attacks and helped the gang avoid being held in criminal custody.
So the band gave Opava and Kořík 30% of the robbery.
The prosecution is about the crimes of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
Firstly, it is a robbery that has been victims of serious health damage, but also abuse of civil protection rights and non-approved armed detention.
Because the police were looking for guns, steel-mounted bullets, laser beams, or machine guns.
The gang charged the robbery to take over ten million crowns.
A band of almost twenty members has already been declared legally guilty in this procedure by the courts of other Berdych robberys and many others.
Other members of the Berdych environment will testify before the court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first trial has so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Ireland in advance, awaiting a final decision on their expenditure on criminal proceedings against the Czech Republic.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
The lawyer of damaged families, Igor Veleba, requires 12 million crowns of pain plus court expenses from the hospital in Třebíč.
For mothers, three million each, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 20,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál Veleba, basically disagrees with his proposal.
"We reject this demand because it's too much," said Dostál after today's trial.
"To make an opinion on the proposal, we need the expert opinion of the opponent.
We'll determine if there's any value at all that can be used.
But let us maintain our view that this will be measurable in hundreds of thousands for everyone," said Dostál.
He says the amount should be between 100,000 and 20,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloíov family wanted a million crowns every month until she raised her own biological daughter.
Veleta was granted a fine of experts on the basis of the compensation negotiations, which was drawn up by the Prague Motol University Hospital.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychologists, suffered different degrees of mental harm and stress.
The stress situation was taken better by men, even if they met with such a vomiting that they did not prevent a newborn exchange.
Women cope worse with the actuality of the trauma that has been experienced and what is happening right now has been summed up in the talk.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the birth of Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their blood parents - to Nikola Čermák, Přibyslavi, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov, Jablov.
Vysočina's Head of Mission Miloš Vystrčil transferred 10,000 crowns to families at the end of October, resulting from the error of the hospital in Třebíčské, which is controlled by the area.
All hospitals in Czech Republic have compulsory damages insurance under the law.
In the event of error, they must extend to the reserve base and may request assistance from the founder in exceptional cases.
Courts have approved relatively low compensation for the people so far, and the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally a few million crown tables.
Polivika lost his kingdom in Valašsko
Bolek Polivka lost a lawsuit to address the Valašsko Kingdom.
According to the Ostrava District Court judge, although he first used the name of King Valachi, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabish, who was working with the color.
Polivika didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabish and his team living in the popularity of Bolek Polivka," said Polivka's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks that in the words of the Valachi Kingdom, everyone remembers the actor-commatic.
This opinion is shared by Mr Harabish.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
The search for money and the development of actions," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could win something out of it.
They want to live from our work," he did.
Future business
According to the court, the King of Valachi used the name Polivka first on television.
He was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohatý in 1993.
At that time, however, this did not depend on the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing valchi passports.
The original student design was a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, which was then based on the creation of a society of the Valašsko Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to give its name and signature in passports, and even its owners were recommended to visit his farm and theatre performances.
Who takes the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabish used the idea only to make Polivka public in view of its business.
"Boleslav Polivka's popularity to the Valachi Kingdom project must have helped," said the judge.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was the Harabish and his team working in an intensive manner.
Today's co-operation with the agreed parties continued until 2000, when he organised an official coronation of Harabish Polivka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polívka and Harabish, which have failed to rescue King I Boleslav forever.
In the kingdom, he took over the leading role of Harabish as queen of mothership Jarmila Šulaka.
In 2002, Polívka Harabish and his companions brought a court action, which the court today rejected.
The battle planned by Harabish could bring light for the throne and half for the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to tell me the details and the time.
"We don't want to catch anything.
This should be something like the execution of Slovakko.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polivika can make an application," added Harabish.
Testing of 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: outstanding prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
The properties of the scheme are nothing special, the quality of the change, the management and the production are often under average conditions.
But his already present successor, Peugeot 207, is significantly better.
And the combination called SW goes another step further, so for me there's nothing left to think about.
When I tested the Peugeot 207 classic hackback, for example, I complained about the location of the head left in the back seat.
This time the complaint is now over, because the carosseries of the combination mean that even the two-foot giants are not suffering in this respect.
A Fever in the World
I get through the inner space quickly so I don't repeat myself many times.
It's relatively successful design, where my only excuse for the poor console is.
I'd appreciate a little more designer inventory here if the looks of the car were so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the seat's short bottom or curtains.
The lateral drive was also significantly improved against the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the carosseria.
The combination then disappears with the head mentioned in the last few places.
Skins in the trunk
So, on this vehicle, you're the main one on your package.
This is very accessible (that is, thanks to the back window that can be pulled out), and I need to assess it as a large space.
The empty spaces are equipped with hold rubbers, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they're dispersible, and they can withstand more difficult things.
But let's just stick to the volume for a little while.
This is based on the tables in the Fund arrangement 428 l, which is more of an average value for competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, such a class of motor vehicles are not the most visited - against the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If you compare 207 SW to the new generation product of the mladá boleslav, you will find that the Peugeot is well behind many 52 litres.
This value is almost critical for a foreign holiday or a baby car.
But if I have to highlight the positives, then I have to mention the almost entirely straight floor after the second row of backs or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The vehicle we tested was fitted with a four-wheel, alien-fired engine with a volume of 1.6 l. 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, it's supposed to look like a thousand-six-six-six-seven who drives a family hackback.
It's quiet, it's low consumption, and it's the main thing to do.
If we compare it to Škoda's supervisor, which often acts as if he had been stuffed in a rag in his exhaust, then I can only be happy about that.
The price is whispering
Car price is not cheap.
We must remember, however, that we tested a spacious interior with a very good engine.
A car with four-hundred alien engines for 329 900 Kč is still leaving.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is a lot.
Drop the equipment with an additional 80,000 Kč.
But we still have headbags, automatic climate, automatic window wipers, rear windows with electric remote control...
I mean, the car comes in 531 900 Kč with a draw.
This is a lot, but counting on Fabia's additional equipment and getting very similar results.
So there's nothing left behind but the decision to make next to the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not successful.
In British schools, more and more children in Eastern Europe are becoming concerned about the further development of local school affairs.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is still facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases of violence in disputes between immigrant and domestic residents’ children.
The problems of the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well demonstrated by a case in the north of Kent, where disputes between their seats and Slovak immigrants are increased.
Disputes between learners and ties are already characteristic of parent relationships.
The situation got to the point that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who said a ten-year-old student with a iron rod.
The sinner is defending him by insulting him with racist secrets.
The police had to go after two twelve-year-old girls attacking Slovak immigrants.
The girls claimed that the man had been molested by racist remarks and thrown with stones.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop this, he hit us with apples and pears, and then he exposed his naked butt," the mother of the Slovak students described the next unpleasant incident for the Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents has identified disputes about immigrants in Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above mentioned cases indicate that in British schools, the mood between local and immigrant people is becoming tense.
In Britain, Slovakia, which is searching for 70,000 jobs, is obviously.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
The visitors are indeed an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, this can be achieved if you have the right answer.
The golden and white coasts, high waves, or sea, calm as a fishy.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with cellars offering pizza, ice cream or sweet cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in full and even more rich lists.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
The Spanish had Cuba's American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by human eyes.
Havana has become a treasurer and a trans-shipment hall that was robbed and transported to Europe by the Spaniards in America.
Then the American era followed.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mob, built it because everything that was considered criminal in the United States (predominantly stench), was welcomed in Cuba and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
The towers were built in Havana, and on the broad highways, cars became a symbol of the 50s of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of Bodegaita del Medio are decorated by the signatures of US show business stars and politicians.
And today?
You can also provide a ticket to the Bodeguita wall in Havana.
They mix cocktails according to your wishes at the Dear Nacional Hotel bar.
And the cars in the '50s are moving to Havana until now, because once they've been exported, they've been rotting in these salty and wet airs.
Although the oldest part of Havana has been significantly smuggled, there is no such thing as the most beautiful colony monuments in the area.
Other places are getting nicer, like Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides the money so necessary, the development of it has become a green road.
In the last 15 years, new hotels were built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, along the coast of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba in the world offers yet another unique taste, primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to the sugar plants and motor trains.
Their motorcycles have not been renewed for decades, so the machines that operate there are machines that can be seen only in museums.
Where are we going?
Most of Cuba’s visitors will not avoid the most well-known places.
So you don't have to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind them that Hemingway is a museum, and someone who likes the writer, does not miss the visit of this museum.
One of the most picturesque parts of Víales Valley Cuba in the western part of the island.
The buja vegetation is growing from the butchery.
Insect formations, larvae and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and in their herds the productive soil has been gathered, which also covers condensed sires with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where the highest quality Cuban tobacco may be grown.
They may meet in the final form at the visit of one of the Havana cigar manufacturing plants.
Some might find it interesting that Major Zeman's episode of Chile was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city, founded shortly after the Spanish island-coonization.
The slave and sugar trade has brought fame and glory.
The economy has spent its body on the beauty and monumentality of a non-great city.
In the four centuries, the Spanish architecture of Gyarmati had a significant impact on the later French people, almost nothing has changed.
Trinidad is such a deceiving place between the plain and the sea that even in the 50s of the past century there were no roads that would have linked this region to the rest of the country.
That certain isolation helped keep an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break down, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time than one afternoon in Trinidad, you'll be worth watching the interesting spots of the neighborhood, like Playa Ancón beach, or the Valley of Sugarseekers.
And tonight it's appropriate to go to Casa de la Música, which will wake up after dark, where music will be quiet by morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities in the east of Cuba are considered the most beautiful city.
I'm sure this opinion will be influenced by the road itself.
Both routes from Guantanamo must fight high and cast mountains, which lead through human activity to a very limited nature.
Thanks to the undisturbed nature of Cuba, UNESCO has added to the World Heritage List.
This is where the best chocolate is made, the church has the cross of Columbus (a hundred years after the shipping of Columbus) and the hill where the former castle was standing and today the Hotel El Castillo is standing, some of which are the most well-known of which are El Yunque.
From coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro plains, from the Bay of Disznó and the island of Isla de Pinos, from the Tropicana cabare, from the Patronous saint of Caridad del Cobra, from Santeria, the African religion that was declared by the successors of former slaves, can be written a lot.
I mean, the way they say it right, it's better to see you once.
The Afghan allies are passive, claim the Americans
Few soldiers and the lack of equipment are also affecting the way the US mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister for Defence Robert Gates, NATO should present concrete plans for the next few years.
The Afghan mission is not thought to be taking place, and the leaders of those countries agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, which has units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resilience of the Taliban movement, eight participating countries are also consulting on further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States Minister for Defence Robert Gates called for greater activity this week, Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid to be a priority.
"Afghanistan's development is palpable, but military forces can only be part of the solution.
The other one would allow the population to start further development of the economy and security," said the British Minister of Defence Des Browne.
Ninety percent
Afghanistan's recovery activity is reported to be the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about one quarter in southern areas.
According to the United States, however, allies have reached their borders in the organization and equipment of the troops.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts were specifically requested to teach Afghan troops.
"We have to think about specific objectives for the future and methods of achieving them," řekl Gates.
He spoke in a similar spirit today to Jaap de Hoop, Secretary-General of NATO.
"I'm not happy about what's in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have approximately 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and this is few," said De Hoop to the Reuters news agency at the end of the three-day session with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Passive
Among the participating countries, there are also discussions in recent months on whether all allies will provide maximum levels in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans are in relatively large numbers in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where violence and fighting requirements are the least, so they are not as high as we are against them as in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
Sun's British tabloid this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan sunbaths have emerged: the Germans play while our sons fight," Sun wrote in addition to the photograph of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counter-intelligence attack and published the photo of a British team in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt is expected to reach one-billito in 2009
All Czechs have 84,000 crowns of government debt.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
This year, the government plans to raise a loan of 159.2 billion.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s public debt reached 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months this year, it rose by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, it decreased from June by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance thus today verified the state debt data from the beginning of October.
There are more debts than 84,000 in each Czech Republic.
Last year, the state suffered more than 11 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit of the next year, we could only go beyond the one-billito-korough limit in 2009.
In the following year, debt will move around 900 billion and a trillion crown," said the analyst of the iHNed.cz server, Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the analyst of Next Finance, Vladimír Pekora, sees this: "In 2009 we can cross the transition of a trillion.
That exactly when it comes to the next budget that's still unknown.
If it were to prove that the political situation would change, the politicians would be ready to do more to cover up, and this could be happening by 2010.
But I don't expect that change," he said.
Debts to be raised
State debt is constituted by central government debt, which is primarily generated by the accumulation of public budget deficits.
State debt is financed by cashiers, public loans, direct loans, or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The government's domestic debt has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4% this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
By the end of September, so-called "retailable public debt" fell to 803.3 billion crowns and from June to June by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average rate of government debt has risen to 6.5 years.
"The debt between the whole year and year increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which really is a great deal compared to the economic progress.
Interestingly, the rise is mainly generated at loan bonds, where the increase is 20%.
The wrong thing is that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be a trade when the pension reform is here," said Pekora of the data.
Better than waiting
The financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007 show that this year the government has planned to take out a loan of 159.2 billion.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the expected 91.3 billion.
In addition, the Czech Solidarity Agency intends to provide a maximum of 13,3 billion crowns, to pay pensions for ten billion reserves, to finance public loans of EUR 43 billion and to cancel loans worth 1.8 billion from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher shows up in front of a cartel court today for a name given to a plysmack
On Thursday night, a cartel court sentenced a British teacher to 15 days in prison and to repatriate from the country because of the violation of Islam in Sudan, a lawyer.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to be named Mohammed. However, Islam's religion prohibits her prophet from any painting.
Such an act can be punished by a misdemeanor.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was a teacher of the Cardoon Unity High School, was arrested on Sunday at her own apartment. According to paragraph 125 of the Sudanian Criminal Code, she was accused of violations and rebellion of Islam after students' parents complained against her several times at the Sudanan Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose the name of the class's plysmack.
"The children proposed eight names: among them Haszan, Abdullah, and Mohammed", says Robert Boulos, the school director.
Finally, 20 out of 23 children selected Mohammed's first name.
Of course, Mohammed is the prophet of Islam, but also a very common first name in Sudan.
The kids then made a journal with the photo of the macquet and the label "My name is Mohammed."
The problem lies in the fact that the illustration of the Prophet's any kind of act constitutes an infringement of Islam.
One Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school, said that he knows him well and that the teacher would never have done anything against any religious belief.
Many students of the teacher agree with this view, and we believe that the teacher is "very well treated with children" and "although she does not talk about religion in the class".
Let us not forget that the second most popular first name in Mohammed Nagy-Britannia is also the second one, and there are 14 different ways of writing in English.
This is one of the ways of expressing respect for the Prophet by Muslim families so many times. (Gyakran receives this name as the firstborn child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can you get this name, for example, a game?
It's obviously an interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last Vienna session in Wednesday.
The outcome is failure.
The final discussion between the Serbians and the Albanians on the future status of the separatist province, which took place on Wednesday morning in Baden, between the Serbs and Kosovo, was concluded without any approach.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not reached agreement on status", announced Mr Ischinger's EU diplomat at a press conference in Vienna.
The American Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace was at stake in the region and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"We don't have to keep it from violence in the near future, but it's a very difficult period to come", emphasising "the existence of open tensions".
The mediation ends on 10 December
Monday's last visit to Serbia and Kosovo is to the European Union, the troika involving the United States of America and Russia.
The 90 percent Albanians live in the province can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Aleksandr Bocan-Harcsenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10th.
A meeting near Vienna in Baden has announced the sixth and last session of the negotiations since the UN entrusted the troika with a new broadcast in August last year.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation mission to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already failed Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, maintain that negotiations continue after the deadline.
"Russia was committed and remains the negotiated solution to the compromise", said Bocan-Harshenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
Once Kosovo has been under UN control for eight years, Western authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina announced that she was prepared to declare her unilateral independence if the Security Council did not decide for her benefit.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"We have not been able to reach an agreement," said President of the independent province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where talks of last chance have been held since Monday."
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the Province also expressed regret.
He added, however, that the idea of Belgrade's autonomy would be "a continuation of the past in murder and deportation".
"Domino effect"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, considered that a compromise was still possible, and the majority of Kosovon Albanians warned about the consequences of the unilateral expression of independence.
Belgrade is still in an unstable area because of the independence wars of the '90s.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of a compromise", said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation once again called for the decision to be the Security Council alone, where the Russian ally has the right to sin.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", announced Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations were held for two years.
They must end in the same place where they started: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu told the journalists that "the Parliament of Kosovo will be the last word". He added that the unilateral expression of independence from the Albanians will be based on the "conclusion" of Western powers.
Bush called for an agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, President Bush, announced at the opening of the International Peace Conference in Maryland Annapolis that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, and President of Palestine, Mahhúd Abbas, agreed to enter into negotiations without delay for the final settlement of the 60-year debate between their peoples.
Bush, in the presence of the two presidents, promised to support them in every way possible in order to sign the Peace Treaty in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must eliminate the "terrorist networks" and Israel must abandon their efforts to enrich themselves - Bush pointed out and reminded the two parties of their obligations regarding the Peace Strategy Plan adopted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that Abbas was responsible for negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel with the aim of "signing a peace treaty with which all dependent problems are resolved, including central issues".
The latter are the three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who lived in the territory of today’s Israeli state during the conflict in 1948.
Abbas, who spoke after the President of the United States, maintained that the future negotiations would be "global and ambitious" and would affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jeruzsalam, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security".
After that, the ascendant Olmer made a promise that the future negotiations would be "compared and continuous" and he would try to "end in 2008".
Bush set out by the end of 2008 the implementation of the existing Palestinian and Israeli 'the two states' vision.
Saudi Arabia said that Bush had a promise to do so before he decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (the participation of Annapolis as a success in Washington) initiated a plan with the support of all Arab countries that will guarantee peace for Israel if it withdraws from all the Arab territories that were engaged in the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a 'answer in the history of the Middle East', in particular because he is stuck with the problem at the root and focuses on the central issues', the Prince of Saudi Arabia believes in his interview with the Arab newspaper of Saudi Arabia.
The D.A. says the police aren't responsible.
What happened exactly on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, the official position and speech contradicts each other.
How was the accident?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the National Police Department (IGPN), after a few minutes of 17 minutes, a police car moved on Louise-Michel Street to Villiers-le-Bel.
"The car was driven, so it wasn't in action. It was 40-50 km/hour, without sirensing," we found out about a police source.
The young "high speed" without two helmets was driven by a green, "non-officially registered motor" (see below) Kawasaki branded engine.
"With the right hand-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a police officer.
The result of the alcohol test carried out on the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the impact that the front of the car is high, the windshield in shape, and the bumper is broken.
In yesterday's extraordinary announcement by Ms Pontoise's State Prosecutor, Ms Marie-Thérèse de Givry, she informed me that she and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate were entrusted with the investigation, which was launched in connection with the "discriminate murder and failure to provide assistance".
During the afternoon, the D.A. said in a press conference that, at the current stage of IGPN's investigation, police responsibility could be excluded.
According to the D.A., three witnesses who interviewed the accident on Sunday night confirmed "the police report, according to which the bug arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car."
On yesterday's day, a strip, which was no doubt drawn by the pedestrians on the road, has shown that the two vehicles were falling together and going together for a while until the police car couldn't control it.
The vehicles have been booked for technical testing purposes.
The body of the two victims was subjected to a medical examination yesterday.
What happened directly after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a rumor that the police quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two young people.
In this connection, IGPN would be careful, but it does not mean that the police "any serious mistake" would have been made.
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation, and which requires increased caution in this process," we learned from the police source.
The Library met a witness who reported after the accident a few minutes ago.
One of the windows in your apartment looks exactly at the location.
"With my cousin, who's a hospital nurse, we went down immediately to try to revitalize them," says the witness.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a cop who was completely confused and mutilated.
The other two tried to revitalize one of the young, and the fourth called."
There was an increasing tension among those present, as the two young people became apparent from the hopeless situation, so the incoming policemen drove their colleagues away from the scene by car.
We also know from the eyewitness's announcement that the ambulance came "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They also applied for heart massages, but nothing.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help young people.
Young people did get help.
Firemen arrived at the scene immediately.
They have done everything they can to save them", stressed the prosecutor.
Female of tension in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations of emergency introduced by General Musarraf two days earlier.
In the eastern part of the country, in the city of Lahore, about 2 000 lawyers who protest against measures taken in the event of a need have been wounded from light gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
They threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were made.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi where the police attacked and injured the lawyers.
They've produced more people.
In Islamabad, the registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike, and protests were made regarding arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
There were several protests in Multan and Peshawar in the central part of the country.
Since Monday, the movement of lawyers has also been supported by the mighty Dehida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which holds the movement of religious parties. "The leader has encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of need and curses those who have sworn before Musarraf."
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court in Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court must state in the coming days the legality of its re-election by President Musarraf, with an indirect vote, on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and has become a different place.
"What we are witnessing is illegal, unlawful and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," said the President of the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he will leave the army's head to play the civilian presidency "has lost his status" - Minister of Information Tariq Azeem announced on Monday.
Until 15 November, Musarraf had to remove his first presidential mandate from his military uniform until the end of his mandate.
The Minister for Information also confirmed the news of the January elections being postponed.
By the way, the Pakistani government dispelled the country-wide rumor that President Musarraf had appointed a place of duty as deputy general.
More than one third of pregnancies are not planned
This result includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) or insufficiently or not designed.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are not planned - forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalises contraception.
This result includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) or insufficiently or not designed.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as tablets or beespyrals, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception made birth control more effective. The study notes that even 5% of women aged 20 to 44 had taken birth control pills in 1970, but now 60%.
Today, 10 of the pregnancies are designed to be eight.
Every fifth couple of months is planning, and if possible, it will be spring, as this is the most favorable season for the child to receive.
Visual repair at space station
Scott Parazynsk astronaut and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to implement a spectacular improvement of the solar panels essential for the scientific activities of the station.
This dangerous range of space proved to be a record in many respects: the repair lasted very long, very little time to design it, and away from the residential modules, it had to be carried out by astronauts with 'poached' tools.
The problem appeared Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese laboratory activities (see boxed section).
This module is a kind of passage to laboratory modules.
However, they need to be taken care of.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to transfer to the final position one module producing electric power with the aid of 17,5 tonnes solar panels, which was already on the ISS.
The crew then started to open the wide solar panels of the module 76 meters.
Of the harmonically folded tables, he violated one of them in about 1 metre length in a condensed cable.
In order to avoid further injury, the panel was not opened.
The first task of the astronauts was to make an inspection of the Discovery Space Cycle and then fix another malfunctioned solar element board. Instead, they had to devote their full time to improving the damaged solar cell.
Scott Parazynskire was chosen to perform the stunt on his 30-foot robot arm attached to the station's crane.
He's one of NASA's best "space walkers."
He's tall, he's strong, he's extremely smart, he's got his upper body, and he's got his long arm.
So the 46-year-old man in medical education had to "operate" the damaged" solar system.
After carefully measuring the damage caused, he cut off the wrong cable, and some "sin" recorded the damaged area.
In Munka, he also helped another "space walker" who stayed near the safe passage, as well as other astronauts from inside, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hokibot, which was seen in isolation against hundreds of volts on the solar panels, the spacers of the station were five years old and "stamped".
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his partners opened the board completely and then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts had a half-day rest, and then today, seven of them returned to Discovery's space chlorine to begin their Wednesday trip home.
Exchange rate for EADS shares
The exchange rate of EADS shares fell greatly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company manufacturing aircraft and defence equipment announced that the A400M aircraft's development would lead to additional costs of EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion.
The exchange rate for EADS shares is currently EUR 21,96 after a 4% decrease.
The company had to review the forecasts for operating result in 2007 as the A400M engine is running late, which is the reason that the aircraft was to be landed later.
The delay in the transfer of a combat carrier aircraft, announced in October, is estimated to be between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will be affected by Airbus," announced the parent company of the EADS company.
As a result of these costs, EADS has to report new plans for its operating result on Thursday next Thursday, 2007 when the company submitted quarterly results, but did not provide any additional figures.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS' operating results decreased by 86%, mainly due to the delay in the development of another programme, the A380 giant machine, which was also a major financial burden for the company.
The company originally designed to transfer A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Stay on status quo
The election of Sunday is not a big surprise: a large majority of Russians will vote for the Head of State Putin, the Single Russia.
In this Russia's need for stability, to say the need for self-governance, is evident after a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, i.e. three days before the elections in Parliament, the Russian Head of State Vladimir Putin is speaking through public service channels on television to the voters, which has already been recorded, but the content is still secret.
Putin will lead the Kremlt party, the candidate list of single Russia, which will be expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
At yesterday's reception of foreign ambassadors, the Head of State's behavior did not tell us anything: it was only another campaign against the intervention of the Western countries, which was a theme of the campaign.
"We know the price for real democracy, so we want genuine, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any kind of violation."
However, according to the opposition, this is not an early case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, according to which they put pressure on the voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gengyáryi Zjuganov, claims that "there was not even such a dirty election in Russia in the time of Jelcin".
After the last weekend protests, the former chess champion, Garri Kaszparov, was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized protests and, according to his lawyer, he said he could not continue to visit.
"The Russians still think of me as a homey"
The predictable election results raise two even more obvious questions:
Who's following Putin in the head office?
The date of the first round of the presidential election was published in the Official Journal yesterday, which will be 2 March 2008, and the candidates will be able to indicate their intention of departure by 23 December 2008.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate should no longer be extended.
But there's no other offspring on the horizon.
What role does Putin play since March?
Is he going to be Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the President as Head of the Allied Russian Party or the majority of Parliament?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power will prevail in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's now become a leaver.
The Russians are still thinking of 'homo cheletics': they don't feel they can control their fate', says Lev Gudkov's sociology, director of the independent Levada headquarters.
Nikolaj Kokosov, historian of the University of Saint Petersburg, goes even further than that: in theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, and the development of civil society is late, and the traditional Community spirit has hampered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putyin went back to the patriarchist model, which was perfect for the people. More so, since this new type of Paternalism was not intimidating, but with some economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman, a co-worker of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "reject personal responsibility from our side", which was rapidly shown after the Soviet outbreak.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all levels of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: local lists of single Russia are led by 65 governors who are removed from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often imitates chaos, as has happened in the 1990s.
Public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians will not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednyiski 54-year-old teacher says, "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Impressive memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the hitler regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometres [27 km] of plaice in Bad Arolsen Province, have so far been available only for the purposes of "humanitarian", i.e. only a unique and name-specific view of the victims or their descendants of the hair.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After each state ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Trusted information
The opening of Bad Arolsen's library allows historians to carry out research "in connection with the transfer of imprisoned people, camp residents and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of documents, because they contain names and thus contain confidential information.
For example, it may be the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some of the victims who have been deported.
The list of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by Gestapo were collected for practical reasons after the war.The aim was to search for deported or forced labor, and possibly to provide evidence of their intervention, on the basis of which they were entitled to compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently working on the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of outstanding importance.
"These documents are basically nothing new", announced Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Berlin University of Technology Research Centre on Anti-Semitism in 2006.
The EU-India Free Trade Convention would be signed in 2008
The turnover of intra-European bilateral trade is now close to EUR 60 billion on an annual basis.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and offers 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope that they will be able to sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Minister of Commerce Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers have already approved in April last year that the European Commission is launching negotiations on free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of the South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's number one trading partner and offers 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also the main foreign investor in India, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner of the EU according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement may have an economic impact for both parties" and that "India could thus increase its presence in a 450 million residential florist market".
The first or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India - the European Commissioner has added. The two giants, Europe and Asia exchange "EUR 47 billion" and "EUR 10 billion services" each year - announced Danière Smadja this week, the head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi. However, he expressed regret that bilateral trade "not always achieved its full potential".The EU and India meet in New Delhi during the 8th diplomatic summit, in which Manmohan Singh Prime Minister and José Manuel Durao Barroso, President of the European Commission, are taking part.

Answering concerns: the Bank of England offers the money market 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England would like to alleviate the concern about credit conditions, so it announced on Thursday that it would pump GBP 10 billion into the money market, which is made available with a base cap of 5,75 % and a five-week period, unlike usual.
"We wish to alleviate the concerns that money market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would also like banks to be able to plan a more secure liquidity position for this period, which is why from 6 December, the Bank offers a significant part of its reserves in the context of a five-week open market operation on the international money market," says the Bank's press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (€14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer is valid for the central bank base and the repayment deadline will be 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England will issue liquid funds for five weeks in the context of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In the press release of the Bank of England, the Bank added that "as well as taking further measures" in order to align interbank loans with my central bank base.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate exceeded September 18 levels: currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer cash market crisis, the Bank of England has been paying a significant amount of punitive interest on the money market, which has put banks back into use.
According to the statement (which only reinforces the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound compared to the euro), many would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank to which they could have obtained more favourable interest and greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups closed down from discussing the articles of socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the Socialists' meeting included about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the Socialist Party's National Bureau, including a 50% increase in the employment supplement, a recovery of variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel check and restrictions on rents.
As UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the talks of the Government Party and the opposition, which were indiscriminate at times in sharp voices, eventually split, which was just a few hours before the television talk of President Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
Jean-Marc Ayraul, head of the Socialist delegation, announced that his group would resubmit all its proposals in the context of the amendment to the draft financial regulation, which will be put on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
A new festival will be born
Now, however, the company organising and promoting the event announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in New Jersey in collaboration with Melvin Benn British producer, Festival Republic.
"It's an honor for us to work with a man who's the triggerer of today's American festival movement," told Billboard.com Charlie Jones of C3.
The C3 organises the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey will be held in the summer, so there will be a way to tent.
The festival takes place between 8 and 10 August in a private area of 500 acres from Philadelphia for about 40 minutes.
The former director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s greatest admirers.
In 1989 he started the organization of the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn continued to expand his palette with the organization of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic called Latitude Festival in Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002 Melvin Benn has been co-owner of Glastonbury Festival production, licensing and organisation. This festival has been able to accommodate up to 177 500 people.
He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company work in parallel to enriching the region with a European-style festival scene.
"The place in Philadelphia has been chosen earlier, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Committee to organize this festival in the centre of Philadelphia," Charlie Jones said.
"We continued to fight with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, because of the political maneuvers of urban governance, the organization failed," continued Charlie Jones.
"We were able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing to host a huge festival at another unique location, which will also ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
In 2005, C3 Presses re-emerged the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after having proven its unique talent for festival organisers with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross revenue for the two events was 9.8 million and 11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals were held at the city scene.
"The European concept of Melvin Benn is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in green urban areas," Charlie Jones says.
Our aim is to combine the two models in some way, thereby creating both the European rural mood and the sense of life in America."
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The population of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, strongly supports the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he doesn't talk about the details of the agreement, he says that "the terms are good enough to enable an investment in an event like this to happen on a site that hopefully gives the festival a long time."
According to Charlie Jones, the festival is going to be huge, and its reception capacity is approximately 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland is going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a wide variety of music offers for everyone to find something for him," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles At, together, are the C3 company, which received the latest Billboard Touring Awards recognition of the best independent event organiser.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator yourself...
The "mucking" is one of the tasks that you're sending from Montreal.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes the filming of his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight "Terminator Governor"?
"We have to be careful, because the film party itself decides which location is best for us.
If you find that Montreal's favourable conditions, you'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions, which are the basis for deciding for us," says Schwarzenegger.
Play for the Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is mainly focused on promoting Canadian films.
Because the competition for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to present and promote more quality films at every American film festival, whether it's Sundance Film Festival, or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival. It's also necessary to ensure that the directors hold hearings.
The L'Âge des teénèbres film received a positive reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
The Palm Springs International Festival will be launched in January.
The Shakespeare Hands with the Devil film is presented in Santa Monica and November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Québec also represented himself with four short films and four toys this month at the American Film Institute Fest event.
Will the end of the year be rally on the stock market? Experts share their opinion on the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already perpetuating their hands and looking forward to the end of the normal year.
However, this year it is not clear to the experts whether this will really happen.
According to Banif, "as a statistical point of view, the stock exchange generally behaves positively in December.
However, only statistical forecasts are not necessarily appropriate, and in the current situation uncertainty is characterised by the market, at least in the short term".
Experts will not hesitate to block the stock market from the end of the year, although they say that "the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this is an opportunity to invest, as there are no alternatives with guarantees, in particular fixed yields, which have a negative impact on the escape to high-quality securities, as long as in the short term".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a lateral, non-volatility-free movement, "mainly due to the unknown effect of reducing the Fed fire, the price of crude oil is high and also threatened by inflation tension".
Javier Barrio, responsible for the sale of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, i.e. it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "it's not a rose situation at all."
The loss of Ibex is close to 4 per cent compared to the highest value recorded on November 8, when index is closed at 15.945,7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so horrific.
According to Juan Solana, Intermoney's analyst, Ibex 35 can also close the year closer to 16,000 points because of the restructuring of the wallets and payments to the normal pension fund at that time.
On the contrary, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be moved by the second week of December after the long weekend of the Constitution's Holiday.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, the Inversis Banco analyst, we are close to the technical level and "we can see a fall in the stock exchange index, which may increase depending on the news coming from the USA, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts that they will be positive.
The analysts agree on what will be the securities intended to achieve the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasises that "this is the time of the big securities."
The expert would put two big banks and a few construction companies on the list, "when the electricity sector will be very expensive by then".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking sector and industry.
The rally can also be positive for the construction companies, of course, if it will be at all.
"The ACS has been trying to regain its positions for months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this way," says the expert.
cyclical consumption will be the main player of the remaining part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas selling period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies are also doing well, although there is not too much representativeness in the Spanish market in this area.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have been only two times a fall in the exchange rate in December.
The real year’s rally was observed in 2003, when stock markets broke out of the crisis caused by the loss of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 28,17 percent corrected, a 6,68% jump was recorded in December.
So it is still open if 2007 will be the fifth year of each other's profits (i.e. Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and could be the final rally.
Banco Popular Español will open an account open for 12 hours from Monday to Monday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This covers a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max, and they bring a big change to the bank.
However, for the other Spanish institutions as well, this is the first group whose branches keep open until 20.30 p.m. and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. until 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also expressed several times that it plans to maintain its branches extended opening, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's been making an agreement with trade unions about closing 75 percent of his accounts in exchange for an afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, since they will decide on this basis whether they will join a more favourable initiative to support business opening.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
In these places, I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local shops.
The bank would like to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the already mentioned opening, since it is not a new opening regime, but a re-alignment of the existing one.
To this end, the institution will modernise its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new kind of thought of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, more colourful design.
The responsibility of commercial banks, Ángel Rivera, points out that there is no need for a large investment in restructuring, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees, instead of the current six.
Accountancy accounts, where even negotiators for SMEs are located, will not sell financial products.
Experiences in sport
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in three Madrid branches.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experiences were positive.
The election took place on the streets of Madridi Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and Rivero said the decision was right.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 branches.
Another 60 works under the name Mundocredi, specialising in immigrants, and has a very favorable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
The PopularMax units do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers," says Rivero.
As a matter of fact, Telephonica has managed to reach agreement and sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco first doubles its rival, Antena 3 stock exchange value
We did it.
With this sentence he expressed satisfaction yesterday when closing the market, by Paolo Vasile, an adviser of Telecinco, when it turned out that he doubled the rival of the TV company he led, the value of Antena 3.
Yet, one of the joys was: "It's just a pain that it's not because we've risen more, but because we've fallen less," he said.
Even now, he has placed a great deal of emphasis on the weak market "we've fallen less".
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 25.4 percent increase.
This increase places its annual losses at 15.66 percent.
52 percent of the company's Mediaset, 13 percent of Vocento's, thus stock exchange value is 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg's data.
He lost 1.52 percent yesterday, and since January, he has had a 40.5 percent fall, so yesterday he's half worth 2.193,46 million.
The other registered communications companies accounted for 3.571 million for Sogecable; for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) 2.518.53 million and Vocento 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is similar between the two companies.
The question is how much we can do on the same market, on what costs and how we can do so in terms of opinion.
Telecinco announced last week that this year he would like to be the first television channel over 1 billion tonnes of advertising, said Giuseppe Tringali, the responsible consultant of Telecinco and Publiespaña.
If the notified fact came into effect, the TV channel would increase its revenues from advertising by 3.6 per cent in comparison to 965.4 million recorded in the 2006 financial year.
The net turnover of Antena 3 rose by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (by reaching 734.4 million), while the net sales of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors contributing to the momentum of Telecinco's stock exchanges is the high pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006 100% of the return of Alejandro Echevarría's company was distributed by its shareholders.
According to Vasile - although it is too soon to decide - this ratio may change after 33% of Endemol has been taken with its parent company, associated with Mediaset.
"We guarantee a minimum of 50% of your payment, although we have always shared much more.
I hope that this year our shareholders will be satisfied, as we have already preferred 33 percent of Endemol's acquisitions."
According to the analysts, the market is currently characterised by some fallout.
Lehman Brothers has recently reduced its profitability estimates for Telecinco by 4 and 7 per cent in 2008 and 2009.
According to their statement, this is known as the estimated increase in turnover from 10.5 per cent in 2008 to 8.4 per cent and from 5.5 per cent in 2009 to 5.1 per cent.
According to the same company’s forecasts, Antena’s 3 profits will decrease by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and by 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Iberscurities: proposes the purchase of both securities, in particular because of the high competitiveness of dividends and its long-term sustainability potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is seen as more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 due to its "more attractive" and increased business.
3.
JPM body: in both cases, it proposes a write-down due to the "conforming risks" (sustained market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the receipt of MiFID entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to Parliament's trial, which today concluded with the Congress vote approving the amendments of the Senate, the government initiated a social dialogue on the regulation underlying the law so that both could enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups have unanimously highlighted the efforts made by representatives and senators to negotiate and conclude agreements that have provided for the establishment of the most favourable normative protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of companies in order to ensure efficient market functioning.
Mifid, which amends the Securities and Markets Act, will enable the modernisation of the financial markets, while at the same time strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between different supervisors of the European Union.
The new profile allows financial advisory services to be provided to specialised firms, but also to natural or legal persons, as well as securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to create a new form of financial service provider (ESIS), notably financial consultancy companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of implementing operations involving funds, thus adding to regulated secondary markets the internalisation systems for multilateral trading platforms and orders that compete with current stock exchange operators.
In addition, the Law requires market information for investment providers with regard to the defining aspects of their business profile, risk-taking and risk management methods, as well as for CNMV control, to keep records of all operations carried out.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has tabled a number of amendments. Of these, it is of key importance that the securities are treated as "complex" money, which is due to the high risk for investors, which has been confirmed by the US in terms of high risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, it was used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economic and entrepreneurship education. This was 30 years after the entry into force of the Royal Regulation setting out professional functions which can be carried out exclusively by public servants in 1977.
The Senate also proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agent who works for another account, does not need the authorisation of CNMV and can sell products or attract clients to several investors at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, taken into account by Eurostat to calculate the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
The disclosure is in line with Eurostat and the European Central Bank's strategy to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
The calculation method used for the preliminary indicator is the same as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from the assessment of information that is not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary index was purely indicative and could therefore differ from the final data to be disclosed on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Government, and the Minister of Economic Affairs stated that the rise in Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only 'ideal', but at the same time it predicted that the price index would be expected to show 'very high' value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less on the same level within the monetary union in recent years.
He added that the November month brought less surprise than the previous month when the government did not calculate such a high increase.
"We've been waiting for around 4%", the Minister of Economic Affairs announced the information published today.
With Northern Rock, you want to reach EUR 42 billion over the three years of Virginia.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen back by more than 50% and currently only GBP 12 billion (16 billion euros) since they had been in crisis in mid-September and had to raise an urgent loan from the British National Bank.
Then there was a record-set deposit of over £25 billion, the number of which gradually decreased over the last two months and a half months due to the loss of confidence among customers, despite the fact that the Government promised a 100% guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
By its own financial and commercial name, Virginia Money will operate this unit, and Virginia will have to earn about a quarter of the British banks' revenue for the next three years to obtain the remaining £18 billion and reach the 30 billion target.
The aim of Richard Branson’s group of highly recognizable businessmen in England is to spend some £50 million a year (i.e. €70 million) on advertising and marketing to achieve the stated goal.
Northern Rock has been offering the Virginia consortium this week, as well as avoiding the bankruptcy. Three other companies are forming the consortium next to Virginia.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested for a suspected corruption case.
This morning, the Silence Guard arrested the Mayor of Totana (The People's Party) in the Murcia Province, since it was suspected of being affected by this week's city corruption scandal.
Besides, one of the secretaries of the Town Hall and the chief of police in the city have been arrested.
In May, the earlier member of the town council, José Martínez Andreo, a popular representative, Juan Morales, who, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, could have been the head of the corruption network.
The police are investigating the city and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' attorney was also investigated as the prime suspect of the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to the SER radio station, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when he left Morales with his records of corruption in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the supposed commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galicia construction company for the requalification of 200 acres of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Mr Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the President of Parliament if the elections are won.
The former Minister for Defence, José Bono, and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, have accepted the offer of the former Minister for Defence, to conduct the list of PSOEs at the next parliamentary elections and to be elected by Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Organization Secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference, and Bono himself confirmed by the party in the centre of the Federal Party today after a meeting with Zapatero at noon.
The Prime Minister justified the election of the former Minister, "we must count with the best" in politics, and Bono is "the best".
He also added that "possibly" the politician of Manchai will be nominated by the Socialist Party for Parliament's presidency if the Socialists win in the forthcoming elections.
Mr Bono would take over the position of current President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he did not intend to start in the next elections and give up his political career in the scientific circles, then fighting climate change.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had continuously ostegrated him to return to the political scene since he left the active politics two years ago.
He added that since the voters were aware of who the Vice-President would be in the case of the Socialist victory, the party wanted to inform them of who the President of Parliament would be.
If Bono really did fill the post, he would like Parliament to be "respective and not the color of insulting or yelling" and more like the home of citizens.
"At times, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it can't be kept quiet to talk, that the Prime Minister's speech has already been interrupted 26 times in the Senate".
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Marín, for his "good work", but he did not want to state himself as President anymore, in order to make his opponents think he was a "stresser".
A Kamp for the Climate
Since the movement that announces climate change is mercilessly chasing both skeptically and skeptically against their forecasts, and those who prefer political or social battles must be very strong.
In fact, he has to put on his side a political leader like the Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that movement is more important than the fight against Islam terrorism, and announces that "we have to make a new deal with our Earth".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the government's activity or inactivity has contributed to Spain's commitment to non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why has the Government not sought to avoid it?
It should also clearly explain to the Spanish authorities what measures they intend to take to contain climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, and what ways will the population have to change, what kind of energy saving needs to be expected at individual and social level, and what economic consequences will it have?
So who has to sacrifice and pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get it and we won't get any explanation for these questions.
It's precisely because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has led to measures, and the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable, and spending money for both companies and the population.
Even the increase in PSOE's gas prices would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, the Earth must be saved from nothing, with purely propaganda texts, with empty, free passwords without actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new posts.
The agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, doesn't demand, does not attack, and even build election meetings and wake us up with weakness.

They arrested Mayor Totana and chief of police on a suspected corruption case.
The Peacekeeper arrested the Mayor of Totana, Andreo, the local Police Commissioner, the City Hall Secretary, and a host industry operator for crimes related to urban development, were informed today by police sources.
The mayor was arrested in his home, then transferred to the City Hall, currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are being investigated by the City Development Council and the municipal body entrusted with the management of the Industrialities and Homes.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land were converted into an area that could be incorporated into an area to allow the construction of 4000 apartments for the Galicia Nuaria company after being illegally paid to the leaders at the time of their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but they are under investigation according to information from the Totana Court of First Instance.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, former mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who today is also under examination by an independent parliament representative of the People's Party.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated as well as the current mayor's girlfriend who lives in the centre of Murcia province.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.The lawyer and contractor were arrested in Nigeria (Pontavedra), together with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, Pablo José M.G., the latter company is a member of the Nuaria Group and has carried out the bribes through it.
The investigation was carried out by a group of criminals entrusted with crimes committed at the level of the Executive Central Board of the Pacific, whose members, apart from the arrests, have conducted eleven search missions, mainly with companies involved in arrests, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, a single person was arrested: the owner of a company with well-known poultry products in the area, who could have played an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was certified as having doubled by the current population of 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Conycase, who is responsible for the management of the parking areas of Coruna, Venezuelan streets and Catholic Ferdinand Square in Vigo, specialising in direct marketing, and Preconiza for the sale, promotion and installation of the Hogar and building elements.

In one of Finland's largest journals, our Finnish journalist found this comment: (of course, in the light of the PISA report on the world's educational level), in Helsinki Sanomat, referring to the criticism of Blackburn's book at the same time on 18 November.
"The philosophic teachings came before the public after the tragedy of Jokela high school.
The killer quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in a student in front of college.
In the news page of the Helsinki Sanomat, Teacher Pekka Elo, who was responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato’s teachings with critical eyes and added that Nietzsche’s knowledge was not necessarily important in high school basic philosophy classes".

One of our colleagues informs us that the Penal Code contains an offence related to Internet downloads:
A. Download a music number is considered a sin and can be punished for six months in a year.
However, if you steal a record of less than EUR 400 in a store, it is only an infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, the theft is already a sin, but the penalty still does not reach the level of penalty to be imposed on internet downloads (Article 234 BKT).
C. If you steal a car, but return it in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the rate of penalty to be imposed in case of online download (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a lower penalty if you're involved in a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you are involved in a mass war, you can receive a penalty of between three months and one year (Article 154 of the BKT), but for copying the CD from six months to two years
(Article 270 of the BKT).
According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD.
F. Marketing of copyright protected films is punishable more seriously without the consent of authors than the sale of pornography materials to minors (Article 186).

My house doctor gave me an article on strange research entitled "The money causes brain activity, especially if others have less."
I mean, the employees' feelings on payday depend on how much others get.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonn, by measurement of magnetic resonants, and the results were also published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and head of the Life&Brain Institute group in Germany, "We measured the strongest activity when the participant answered correctly, the partner was wrong".
Researchers found that if they both gave the right answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity increased.
I don't know why you needed such a big science for such a simple concluding.
Chief Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been mercilessly chasing the Balkan war criminals in the Hague, and the Criminal Court's office for the crimes committed in the territory of Yugoslavia.
His mandate goes down at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a bit of bitter mouth, as she is responsible for srebrenica's bloodshed, during which 8000 Muslims in Bosnia were slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and the Serbian leader Radova Karadics are still on the loose.
They are named on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach to address his documentary: Carla's list (2006, Spain has not yet been introduced). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the governments concerned in order to contain the loop around the refugees.
What kind of insurance does that suit me?
Car insurance, which represents a safety for the owner of the car in relation to the various cases of damage and also depends on a number of factors such as age, sex, date of obtaining a license, family status, type of car to be provided and the nature of its use.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is the insurance agreement between the insurance company and the insurance undertaking.
This agreement has been concluded in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes compensation in respect of a fixed insurance premium in the event of an event of damage.
In practice, the premium is the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking account of different factors such as age, sex, date of obtaining a licence, family status, type of car to be provided, its use and others.
Insurance companies shall determine the insurance fee on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount of the person representing higher accident risks.
That's why women over the age of 25 pay less than they pay because statistics suggest that they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, on the basis of the findings, insurance companies concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency of use of the car is crucial.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
In determining the insurance premium, insurance companies take a number of factors into account.
Therefore, the owner should look carefully at to select the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the key factors for the choice to best adapt to the needs of the insured and to establish an acceptable price.
When concluding the insurance contract, subjects under 25 should have a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of the licence.
Although the most ideal, if we are at every risk, there are more economical solutions.
The most careful managers can tie up complete insurance, thereby ensuring all risks and the price will also be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured person pays part of the damage.
"The amount of self paid by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the part," says Luis Noguera, the director of First Europa in Spain.
Another option is increased liability insurance for third parties when the customer ensures that he is against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage incurred in his own car.
In addition, there will be insurance against theft, fire and car loss.
Good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents, as this has an impact on the bonus and so you can reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
A bonus is called a bonus compared to the basic rate of the insurance company.
And we call the fine that was removed from the basic tariffs a mishap.
"The bonus and the level of the malnutrition depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the company's had a good year, you can afford to increase the bonus rate" explains Noguera.
Once the age limit of 25 has passed, it is easier for owners to make adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced due to the experience gained over the years.
That's when we advise you to make a complete insurance of yourself.
"In general, young people are not yet able to apply their experience properly during an accident or even when driving," says the director of the European Insurance Company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when leaders have already gone beyond the fear of the beginners.
If the insured is already married, but there are no children, the best way to make complete insurance is, of course, if your financial options allow this.
Insurance companies hold children's couples to the lowest risk customers, so in their case, the fee is also lower.
In this case, the best way is to extend the insurance to the damage caused to others from the third year of the motor vehicle (which can reach 300 euros), or if it has a higher bonus.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have greater purchasing power and they can afford to be a higher part of you," says Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, complete insurance can be extended to liability insurance by itself (around 150 euros) or by higher bonus.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it represents protection for the owner in the event of damages, but also because it means a great deal of spending, so it is essential that we select the customized form of insurance properly.
The Celtic wants to get a point in Milan to get into the eighth quarter.
Milan and Celtic on Tuesday measure together the power of the San Siro stadium to obtain the missing point when the Champions League closes. Italians can be the first to do so and the Scots can qualify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and in the fifth round, they have guaranteed a move with a tie with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but one more should be that the six-point Shakhtar, who is going to fight Benfica, should not go ahead.
The two games of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play at the Club World Championship in Japan, where he will try to fight for progress to the 16th final on the 13th final.
With this group D will close sooner than the others, and although Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be the most likely result, the two teams will try to win, because the Italians will not miss home, and Celtic will start at a better place in the eighth quarter.
Even the defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify himself if the Shakhtar won't win, but it can't be certain, because if there's a balance, the Ukrainians will continue to win last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won the next strike (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night of the Scots, who would like to join the Association of Champions League twice after they were given a goll from the Cake in the 0-0 final extension (1-0).
The Shakhtar victory of "Rossierik" could be most pleased, because if Celtic loses in the eight-sixth round, it stays in the UEFA.
Because Benfica is standing in the last place and is not a chance to stay in the European Championship, you can still get the third place with a victory to play with in the UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the Spice Girls' first concert.
Spice Girls started their tour in Vancouver (Canada) for the first time before 20,000 viewers since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert organised at the Vancouver GM Place that the concert was "in the form".
Some 20,000 people changed tickets to attend the concert where they also presented a video film about the huge successes of the band in the 1990s.
At the same time as the concert was reconciliated and the tour, the EMI has launched a new album on the market in Spain, with larger hits and two new songs including "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five members of Spice Girls, the British footballist David Beckham, came on stage from Posh Spice's husband.
The athlete was also at the sight of GM Place, although a few days earlier Victoria banned him.
When the performance was announced, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "did not see our present dress, so I'm nervous about what you'll think of the performance".
'Sporty Spice' was the reason that the band split up two years after he left the band 'cause the members didn't understand each other'.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings for Spice Girls change.
I thought why not? I'm glad I decided to" said Chisholm about the band that broke up nine years earlier.
The singer also said that, over time, " things have been arranged and we love each other very much".
But there's been a lot of changes since Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV TV reports, the band came to Vancouver on a special flight to Virginia Airlines.
At the airport, a bunch of baby-sitter was waiting for them.
They've got seven kids in total.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California (USA) and then in San José (December 4 and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid, they will act on 23 December.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas price has been renewed between Ukraine and Russia, which can also affect Russian fuel transported to Western Europe.
The bulk of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine and the disputes between the two nations are always a great concern.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the gas price paid by Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
One earlier debate between the two countries has resulted in a reduction in supply to EU countries last year.
The most recent debate between Kiev and Moscow is on the attempt of the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, the Gazprom agreement on the level of gas price paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that a 50% increase in gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan should be made in relation to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to the analysts, this could mean an increase in the price of 40% of the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important to argue during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important countries of the gas supplier's transit," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs Anatolij Kinah, Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to the debate on the level of costs of transit through Ukraine (and transit to Western Europe)."
As a result of the recent major gas price between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas trap leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant decline in exports to Western Europe, which also pushed prices to a large extent.
A quarter of the European Union's gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom adds its own gas supply by natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
NHS is "an obligation to monitor foreign workers"
The NHS Committees in Scotland should improve the monitoring of criminal records for workers coming from outside Europe - a supervisory body has said.
Robert Black's chief accountant suggested that a doctor with foreign citizenship in Scotland was linked to an attack on the Gulf airport in June.
Black also expressed concern about the fact that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of workers employed overseas.
At the same time, in his report, through the model of five health authorities, he also pointed out key controls that have been carried out properly.
Following the attack on the airport in Glasgow, the principal has checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdulath, a doctor of Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, Iraq, was arrested at the airport after a Jeep drove to the headquarters of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who heard through the Old Bailey Court in October through a video link indictment of car bombing attempts in the UK.
The NHS Committees, in the case of their staff from overseas countries, should check the existence of the qualifications and experience of the workers concerned and provide them with the permits necessary to work in the United Kingdom before the start of employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees are using Disclosure Scotland to check the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain information of this kind outside the UK.
The auditor's report has suggested, inter alia, that the Committees introduce a guide from the Criminal Office, which facilitates the monitoring processes with different overseas countries for employers.
"While we found evidence of such checks in the records on staff, they are not regularly carried out," says the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment review process at the same level, adding: "Our report highlights the areas that can be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of staff from NHS overseas".
Dr. Peter Terry, President of the BMA Scotland, says "unorthodox" that pre-employment checks allow us to identify potential NHS staff who will be able to commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report says that pre-employment checks are working well in the NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent".
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas workers composed of doctors and nurses is 1161.
However, the auditor pointed out that the numbers are likely to be higher, which is partly explained by the fact that the Committees are causing a problem for the identification of employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Aran region, Grampinan, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are largely coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and certificates of qualification.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the directive and guidelines on pre-employment checks for employees from NHS overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgieon said: "I am so pleased that after the attack on the airport in Glasgow, this task has been carried out.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals set out in the report and ensure that the updated guide on pre-employment checks for the entire employee group, including those from overseas countries, is intended to reflect best practice.
Joy Division Board at the Film Prize Department
The bipic from Ian Curtis, Joy Division's late singer, "Control", has released five prizes for the British Independent Film Prize, including the best film prize.
He received a prize from the lead character, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis was formed, as well as Anton Corbijn, and Toby Kebbell.

And the Variety Prize - for setting the British film into an international reflector - was taken by Daniel Craig, who formed Bond.
The prizes were awarded as part of a ceremony at Roundhouse in London.
The "Control" film shows Curtis's rise within Joy Division Berkein until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
"The Killers, David Bowie," as well as "New Order on the soundtrack", were created in just 3 million pounds.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn, who has previously become known by making the album covering U2's "Joshua Tree" album, still rich with two prizes; with the best director and best starter award.
Another winner of the ceremony placed rock music at the center; Julien Temple Joe Strummer, his film about Clash's singer, took the award for the best documentary.
The best actor has been awarded the Viggo Mortensen award for the development of the Triller, the head of the "Gyilk Promises" in London organized by David Cronenberg.
Ray Winstone, who was disoriented of his hard-boy roles, was awarded Richard Harris for his outstanding contribution to the British film team.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name is included in the film "Scum", "Ehcoppon" and "Sex-Dum", is currently being filmed by Indiana Jones and the King of the Crystal Corps.
Winstone is proud to receive the award from the star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter", named Harris in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened a gate," added Winstone.
"I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his age, and I appreciate him very much."
The selection of independent film prizes known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organisers.
Among its supporters and patriots are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people have been arrested in connection with terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested, who were planning an imminent attack on an oil facility, and more church people and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaida has launched a military campaign against the Monarchy, which has been acting as an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
According to TV reports, eight-person cells led by a foreign citizen are planning an attack on an oil plant in the Eastern Province.
After the attempt to attack Al-Qaida, the world's largest oil treatment plant in Abqaiq, in 2006, Saudi Arabia, started the construction of a rapid response force of 35 000 people to protect facilities.
According to the report of the Minister of the Interior, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell run by a "specialised person for missile attacks" who is illegally crossing the border.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the Kingdom territory.
On 22 of them, plans were made to commit attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government called on church leaders to stop the Saudis joining Iraq, Al-Qaida, who are fighting the Allied forces and the American-supported ski Muslim government.
The Al-Qaida warriors are considered to be a significant part of the religious leaders of Saudi Arabia, who have been involved by the authorities in supporting the government's rule of the royal family.
Fighters of the organization - inspired by the call to Osama bin Laden to target the Western-friendly Saudi government - for attacks on foreign residents, government buildings and energy facilities.
"The security forces have made huge efforts in the last... five months", a secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs said to state television.
During the arrests, a 16-person media cell was caught in Medina, with the aim of spreading the "takfiri mind". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of the Sunnita Muslim radicals, which supports violent action against the distrusted Muslims and left to believe.
32 persons accused of financial support from the militia were also arrested.
The Venus climate can provide an overview of the future of Earth
According to scientists yesterday, Venus could once have provided pleasant living conditions.
The data of a European orbiting spaceship indicate that this planet is much more considered to be Earth's sceptical twin than we thought before.
Venus is the nearest planet thirst on Earth.
In terms of the size of the two planets, it is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is a little closer to the sun.
According to scientists today, several billion years ago, Venus could have been governed by very similar living conditions and even living conditions.
However, due to the peakly high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by sunlight and the lower motion speed of the planet, Venus entered a different stage of development in the sea.
Today, water has been evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, based on the study of the planet for a year, are a fascinating picture of how such disastrous climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, Professor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, who is one of the leaders of Venus Express's mission, said: "Please draw out why Venus's climate differs so much from the experience on Earth, even though the two planets are otherwise very similar.
"Our new data enabled us to develop a script about the development of Venus years ago when he could have living conditions similar to Earth.
"Red uranium" captured by the police
A kilo of radioactive material - according to reports, enriched uranium - was taken yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and the material was investigated.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was about enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million ($4800,000).
Open gates
Mitt Romney said it was wrong for a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded questions for video and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the questions released on Wednesday night 28 November proved as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on the other party on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers on this occasion reflected the position of the Republican Party approaching next year's election.
To date, it is not known how CNN’s production leaders co-financed the debate were selected on exactly what basis YouTube clips were submitted to candidates.
The longest question for the first half of the debate was immigration.
It's one of the Republicans' toilet parlors.
The CNN called for some uncertain voters to dial a number if they had a sounding voice: the mediator has found great consensus when the candidates made a strong statement on the question of the borders.
The most lively and longest debate took place between Rudy Giuliani at national level and Romney, who is taking forward key pre-elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the picture of him that he treated the issue of illegal immigration too easily during his new york mayorship.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from former Massachusetts to build his house.
The syllabus between the two became particularly acute when the questioners were interested in supporting 'amnesty' (which would ensure permanent status and citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter, California and Tom Tancredo, have managed to get deep into the subject.
Even though none of them count as a potential candidate, their remaining in the competition field may be explained by the fact that they first and louder than the others had begun to call on immigration.
At least in the area of immigration, there is broad consensus among candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This theme, like fear of Chinese toxic games and other worrying factors coming from the outside world, promotes the division of Republicans and Christian conservatives within the Berkes, or makes them minimised.
However, when other topics were raised, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why she had previously supported the arms control.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulations should be considered torture.
Another asked whether the candidates believed all of the Bible’s words.
In this context Giuliani was finally caught up in the perspective that although he was looking at the Bible in his favorite book, he might not literally interpret the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was the first to acquire this right-wing election in Iowa, who was responsible for his winning Christian conservativeism, responded to the expectations that the death penalty was painful, but needed.
When he was concerned about whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, laughing at him, he said that Jesus was wiser than he would go in the elections.
Competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee iowa is in line with libertarian Ron Paul's money-gathering campaign and the enthusiasm of Wednesday's debate.
The sudden outbreak of the two candidates explains that the two wings of the party have not yet been able to create a common candidate among aspirators representing more well-known and more traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who joined the party who had timely and convincingly thronged the victory message of America and found the common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party has been divided, and the consequences of this are yet to be invisible.
Working Party pains
Another gap in front of Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, it doesn't seem too squeaky now.
No one sold his honor, no politician ever came up with a hotel bill in Paris, no one committed a scandal outside of marriage.
However, the discovery that a rich businessman, under the name of others, contributed a sum of over 650 000 pounds (1,3 million USD) to the Labour Party of Great Britain, and that he did not report this party, was one of the things he would have had without the surrounding Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with the election, and when he declared that public opinion polls had not affected the outcome of the decision, he thoughtlessly questioned the intellectual capacity of the British, people were still hoping Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, an increasingly witty leader of liberal Democrats, noted, the once feared Brown Stalin was transformed into Mr. Bean.
The failure to save a bank, called Northern Rock, has crucified the regulatory weaknesses and the lack of judgment.
Patient proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to come together with the government.
The loss of the 25 million people's personal data by the tax authorities has inevitably revealed a high degree of maladministration.
In the House of Lords, three-seat Generals, who protested against the reduction in the military's budget, saying that the position of the Minister of Defence is part-time work.
And now David Abrahams' mysterious donations are here; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of the Labour Party (early administrative director) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which governance is impossible.
People do not like politicians or trust them, but when a new group comes to power, their disbelief is usually suspended.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is very unlikely to be able to move things forward and may not remain in his post for a long time, the suspended disbelief is over: the civil servants' arm will begin to leak, the governors will be in the adjustments, the press will look after bad oral news; and the government will begin to defend and be unable to concentrate.
Brown is in a particularly difficult situation in a way, because unlike other political leaders, he doesn't count as "new blood".
As much as you'd like to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, it was your right hand.
For example, problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax records are linked to decisions taken during Brown's finance ministry.
And although a prolonged examination of the relationship between Blair's actions, such as 'money poverty' and political party funding, is not directly involved, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is quite unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The blasts that have been fired aren't as scary as those throats are.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
Moreover, compensation - whatever pain it takes - can be the creation of the directions always promised by Stalin living in Brown: reliable, solid and slightly hard government.
For example, there is a coolo around political donation.
The Garbóian suspect Abrahams, who compared his donation to charity, said he didn't want his prophecy to be presented to the public.
Perhaps so, however, it was not his responsibility to make the decision.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters can be clearly and clearly justified: the public has the right to know who knocks on the country's leaders' gates.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about Abrahams’ action, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly sweat during the interviews; as Jon Medleson, the founder of the Labour Party, who was aware of the confusing donations in October.
But to Brown, for the time being, they don't lead the threads: there's no indication that he knew about these reels, not even that the huge amounts were paid after Brown's office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
However, he was quick to condemn the violation by his party, but he diluted his strength to reach a familiar instrument; by investigating the case, in order to be safe, he entrusted a committee chaired by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, "a lesson to learn" is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown needs to take some other steps, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent committee on administrative rules without a leader six months ago, or the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require co-operation from the hard-fishing Labour Party with the stories and the separation of special financial relations with associations - it would be a hard wall for the party Brown.
But you should face some of the facts about the party.
Surveys show that conservatives are currently a major advantage; Brown has two years to conquer the voters; the only way to use victory is impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Cardoons
Does the second market mortgage crisis threaten America's credit card market?
If there's blood in the water, it's natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is failing, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage crisis affects other forms of retail credit, the losses of the credit card market can reach up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
The description rate of both inflexible loans increased and the default rate of late payments over 30 days has been increased.
HSBC reported a loss of USD 1.4 billion last month in the US consumption finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is still early.
The proportion of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The 3-89% late payment rate calculated by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is one percent lower than the historical average.
The fall in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The changes to the US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 have led to a sudden reduction in the number of whistleblowers, while at the same time there has been a major loss on the credit card market; a re-inflationary increase in the number of bankruptcy claims (and thus the description rate) is expected, regardless of whether the total amount of the terms of the borrowing will deteriorate.
The payment rate, which shows the percentage of monthly consumer credit write-offs, is also strong on the market.
In addition, trust in securities covered by the credit card is quite strong despite the depression in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at the TowerGroup research firm estimates that the 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
The evidence of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market is clear: consumers will increase their debt on credit cards to cancel housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers mainly monitor money movements and do not monitor asset values, so housing prices do not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation that has been created may even be beneficial for creditors.
If the property is less than the mortgage value, the incentives for credit write down will be reduced for consumers; as a result, repayment of debt on credit cards will lead to a higher priority.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt more quickly and more flexiblely to variable terms compared to mortgage creditors.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden reuse of devices.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll wake up fully revaluing the loans" says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of gradual decline is more likely.
If lower house market prices and a fall in lending bring America into recession, the industry will no doubt look forward to a tight future.
It's worth monitoring those predators.
British bankers pleaded guilty of the Enron case.
On Wednesday, he confessed his guilt to the three British bankers who were brought to justice to investigate their role in fraud with the former Enron Financial Director Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew began to be innocent at the week-to-day fraud charge, which is to be believed to cooperate with Fastow in a covert fraud in the year 2000 that they wanted to gain at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
At a court hearing, however, before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., all of them acknowledged the guilt of the uniform fraud.
The three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Greenwich NatWest, became known during the two-year assignment process in Britain.
The closure of the investigation into Enron’s case following its collapse in 2001 is still waiting for you in the United States.
The first prosecution against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of the government investigation that initiated Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers cross over "NatWest's Triangle", charged that in 2000, he traveled to Houston in order to prepare the fraud with Michael Kopper, which was then the right hand of Fastow and Fastow.
Fastow was also under the control of Enron’s subsidiary Enron in which he invested at the Greenwich NatWest, responsible for planning countless fraud.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its existing shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew well that the interest was very high.
A company managed by Kopper bought the bank’s existing equity of USD 1 million in its subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to buy a share in this company.
According to the case, Fastow has wrongly informed Enron that the energy company buys its share of a subsidiary worth USD 20 million from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The prosecution says bankers reached $2.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others reached $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his double guilt over Enron's collapse.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving his six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a prison in Texas.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States on a one-million-dollar bail per head, where they were staying during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest American company ever reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks that have been used over the years could not cover the millions of debts and the profitable, but in fact, the loss-making companies.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs have disappeared, and the market value has decreased by more than 60 billion dollars, while pension funds have decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's founder, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted last year for their involvement in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving the imprisonment of over 24 years old.
The conspiracy, fraud and other accusations imposed on Lay have ceased with the death of the man last year.
No poverty in Moscow
For 54 million dollars, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with Rolls-Royce engine will start without interruption to Moscow and Los Angeles with a tank.
However, this amount is only a small amount for some Russian wealthy.
"There are 18 passengers in it" said Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"No one's ordering so many seats, because machines are bought for private families or corporate leaders."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day exclusive Milliomos Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods supplier rented a stand at the exhibition, he hoped that all the Russian new owners would be interested in, from the mahogany- covered yachts to the refrigerators worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not after our products," he said.
Private aircraft after the United States have the largest market in Russia.
The Russian capital seems to swim in the money like Dallas did it in the day of the oil strike.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some Americans went to Europe. These Americans were considered material here," said Marshall Goldman, Senior scholarship at the Davis Centre of Harvard University and Eurasian Studies.
Like Japanese gambling players in Saudi Arabia and the 1990s, Russians now became the world's most visible poets.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of gold wire.
At a conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnaul, president of the LVMH shared his opinion on how to sell high-value products on similar markets to Russia.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times, organised the conference.)
According to Forbes' list of richest people, there are 53 billion people in Russia who have a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second class reaches 103 000, who can make up a total of 670 billion dollars, has established a study by the public authorities of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an analysis of personal welfare developments in the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank's figures show that in 2005 the number of people living below the standard was 15.8 per cent in Russia.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, which is why we are all here" said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole first participated in the fair with her brand Russian distributor, the Soho Jewish Group.
"All women are without excuses, and men are a real treasure mine."
In the rooms, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both of their customers, were assigned to millionaires.
"I saw cars and tried to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said young Yumatova, who was too busy in his unique design and design, as if he had been used to this drive.
The sale was organised primarily for the newcomers, for those brand-oriented Russian customers who were willing to go around a hunky, chiffran decorated venue after several hours, where you can find Cadillac Escaleds at the same time, platinum pocket knives, Möpenpick ice cream, regular billiard tables, dubai apartments and Gund plus cards.
The ticket will be EUR 30 for the average person (€44.57).
"The Russians like to know what brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who is patriotic with regard to the Dutch producer, Royal Delft's stand, in contrast to a wall-sized, hand-painted Rembrandt painted in blue for a imitation.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in rising things."
Indeed, the salesmen here said that the long time (based on the Russian Stenders, this means 10-15 years) rich Russians had already tied up extractive logos with a bagel, limited number of brands that would not enter a commercial fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires and millionaires, and tourists, spent their quarters every day strangled.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil Beds, said that day he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, which are worth $70,000 each.
Also, on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto's sales staff on the provision of high-quality cars with modern alarm reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, sells three fridges on Sunday afternoon to Rolls-Royce Phantom. The bars are similar to connected chainsaws and cost each 55 thousand dollars.
The reporter also presented a wheel for the owner of a Russian casino, which he said was involved with Swarovski crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
Set of four pieces: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to take a picture of the wheels made of struccps and of his wife's face from a circus game will not necessarily use these things."
"He's gonna keep them in the garage holding 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of Russian clients are rich, Karapetian says that the term "orosmous millionaires" today is not a great privilege, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
"He who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is most likely now millionaire if he's not in money, but at least on paper."
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least create the image of wealth in front of the status of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style phone boxes that were accumulated with millions of counterfeit dollar bankers.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, told us that his team printed 500 thousand counterfeit banknotes at the Millioms Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with money. Many people made photos of themselves with a mobile phone like they were hiding in the register, or they just put a few million in pocket.
"See, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," said Karryev.
They're suspected of a surgical defect behind a death in New Jersey.
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked down the window of a restaurant called "Only A Little More Healthy" and saw an ambulance stop at Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon later, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston, one of the inspectors working at the restaurant.
"I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41, named Olga Arroyo.
The investigation is currently under way to determine whether the death was caused by an unauthorized operation by a cosmetic surgeon who had not been identified by the police.
The authorities have failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the toxicological tests that will become available in a few weeks' time will reveal this mysterious death, which has been greatly affected by the high-ranking staff of the Newark police.
Arroyo, whose voice was known by many in the department, has been working as an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, hard and reliable" said McCarthy Arroyo in a Wednesday interview.
He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy told me that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of the former Newark Police Officer, Jimmy Arroyo, currently working on the Committee on Check-in Products, and two, a 14 and a 11-year-old boys, and a step-on-the-macre.
Eileen Walsh, DA of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, declared that the investigators were working on investigating whether Mrs Arroyo was the victim of an unauthorized surgeon's intervention.
"The likelihood of" said Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
According to the authorities, they got to the house about 3:00 p.m. November
On 21st and Arroyo, she was found on the couch.
He was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week passed, and the police have already told me very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about whether Castro was being heard by the detectives.
In the study, the participants investigate whether a part of the house is functional as a medical clinic.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door in Castro's home, where there was a horrific rosebread in the narrow front garden and a melody barked from the back of the house.
By the door leading to the basement, in the car entrance, there was a blue bottle marked "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
From hooks, two mountain bikes hung to the side.
McCarthy recalled when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years at the New York Police Department, Mrs Arroyo gave her an invaluable help by helping her adjust to the unusual and unsatisfied political culture of the new city.
"Always, he said, "You'll be better careful with this," he remembered.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was still inside when I left at night.
It was a mess."
Waitings for Fed to cut interest will lead to an attack on world stock markets
On both sides of the Atlantic, stock prices jumped yesterday, after the peaceful statements by the President of the Central Bank of the United States have strengthened their hopes that Fed will try to ease investment opportunities with further interest.
The stock markets, both in London and New York and all over Europe, have been encouraged by the fact that Donald Kohin, who is declared to be the right hand of the Fed President Ben Bernanke, must respond to the continuing unrest on financial markets in a manner that is necessary and pragmatic.
In addition to the clear aim of Kohn to ease the markets in the middle of the renewed credit crisis, he stated that the current anxiety "returned market developments at the end of September and October".
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it can increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit standards of households and companies.
The declarations were interpreted by investors as ‘Fed’ is prepared to inject fresh capital into US markets or even further interest reductions in order to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements also seem to be a tranquilizer for Wall Street, which has recently been accompanied by several bad news about the American economy, such as a negative record of the number of U.S. housing sales.
The side effect of financial anxiety was also confirmed by the announcement by Bear Stearns investment bank that it will deliver 650 employees and 4% of the global employment share as part of the cost reduction to compensate for losses in the US second market housing credit sector.
The measure concerns a total of 20 jobs in London, which employs 1500 employees.
In New York, the average industrial index of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and it closed at 13.289,40 points, while the larger index of S&P 500 increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed by 6.306.2, thus increasing the value of British blue chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The lack of confidence in the credit market was renewed after the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank, the three-month paper was sent to the European banks at a price of 4.7% since April 2001.
After the English interbank interest rate, after a balanced increase after 12 November, Libor reached the highest value since September, 6,59 per cent of the Bank of England was all under greater pressure to follow Fed and the ECB and to issue additional capital for the London money market.
In England they follow the decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who's the English team for a six-legged meze in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And with the first test against Sri Lanka indirectly, it's no less important than who's making the decision?
The latter question is, on the one hand, current because David Graveney, Chairman of the selection team, who temporarily performs this task, provides assistance to senior coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughn in the decision-making process, and, on the other hand, because the branch of the English administrator Hugh Morris' desk begins to fill in requests for a national or at least a one-time pick-up post.
Among the two players pulls the shorter which does not get the sixth bat place, but as known, life, and especially sport is often unfair.
It's never easy to say what makes someone's profession peak, while others can't even get past a lower level.
Not only is it difficult to choose on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to see Shah if this happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, well-known young leaders of business are placed before decision-makers, while there is only one for them.
Who can tell which level is a croquet player without throwing him into deep water in a major race?
Of course, the data greatly influence the decision, but the options are equally important.
In a team, the player has to catch the captain's sight at the right moment in the croquettkapu, and a bat player has to get a regular chance if he wants to become a big player.
Getting the eyes of the collections is much more complicated.
For example, more than James Anderson played better over the past season, but he still count himself a certain team member on the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's own saying that he's in good shape and that he's doing very well for him.
Anderson's 32 first-class gate hit and fought 33 runs to take part on the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them had successful moments at the highest level and hoped they'd be like this in the future.
If Shah or Bopara are going to play at Asgiriya Stadium, well, they'll decide that based on your opinions.
This decision may upset or break anyone's career, but it may also have no particular effect on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played on every test and performed with five doors and 40 useful runs well, but it was Paul Collingwood, who then took the highest and decisive test, who may still be underrated today, even though he obtained double hundred points against Australians in Australia.
It is likely that, during their discussion in Asgiriya Stanion today, taking account of the conservative instincts of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, they will put down their vodka in addition to the greater experience of Shah, Bopara's young life and dynamics.
There are arguments for both sides.
In addition to Shah, the bright and successful decunction of the 88th Bombay test is performed in the quarter. He was seven years younger than the 22-year-old Bopara six, who, in other words, had an excellent screw-up in the drums, he reached 32 first-class hundred.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah ran only tens in two quarters on the Lorda test against West Indies in May and the fact that Vaughan, who fought for it in the next game, ran into the immediate resistance of the constituents, seems to have reduced the endurance that was clearly seen in Bombay.
In contrast to him, the universal talent of Essex is a lifeline and an inexplicable player.
You can't get upset by anything on the crocket track, but you've described your behaviour outside the field well when you went up at an exhibition with a four-wheel drive from the Volkswagen.
The first thing he did, though, was to take over Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) and call his remote teammate, Alastair Cook, to ask him, "Have you seen this?"
A better track player with Bopara classics. He creates a useful pitch for his skid medium steps, and his punches are confident and clever.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara the chance right now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would be offering outstanding attention if, as the Cheylon tea leaves suggest, he'd be the one who plays this weekend.
They're transporting refugees home with buses to work and fight Al-Qaida
They've been arriving in Baghdad from Syria since yesterday with Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or lost their visa or are actually those who hope that the city has returned to order.
There are also those who returned to fight those soldiers who drove them out of their house.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan before a 800-person from Damascus filled with dozens of buses, government convoy has arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I returned today because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and newspapers and that the city is safe now.
"They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people," he added, referring to the minister of al-Sadr militia who has currently shut down his ski resort.
The 38-year-old ski teacher, who lived by the Sunnis, Qassim Al Atwani, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqis from working.
His ski neighbors called him and called him home, saying that he was able to squeeze Al-Qaida out of their bout in the west of the capital with the help of American supported teams.
One of the first people from Jordan was a sunnite and ski resort leader who fled from the home of a grenade attack in Sleikh north of Baghdad after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had created an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they needed to support me and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obei.
Many spoke of the fact that in the capital, a strengthened peace has been involved in American troops and that armed civilians working with the Americans have been lured home.
But even more were forced to return from Damascus due to water problems and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, has expressed a widespread view among the refugees, according to which the Syrian Prime Minister, Mr Nouri al-Maliki, asked the Syrian Government to reject the refugee visa application in order to force their return home.
More than two and a half million people are said to escape the death squads in the country.
"It was all right until Al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and did not put pressure on the government so that it would not issue any more visas to Iraqis in order to move home," said the pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I fled."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the Sunnits were driven away from the ski areas, while the rails also left the territory of the sunnitate, resulting in a reduction of tension in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will re-create the days, which could lead to more battles.
Small Saar region - education training
The smallest federal province plays a leading role in vocational training and its higher education is also international oriented.
Only in a field of training are the island-regions struggling with the same shortcomings as the rest of the country.
"I explained 50 times a day to a man outside the island that we are not French" - this self-heroronic symbol announces his posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have an important role to play in the education system in Saarland, which, on the basis of the surveys of the German Institute for Economic Development (IW), can boast the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions, even for the sake of traditions, work closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Island was founded by the French in 1948.
To date, students can complete their studies with double or even triple degrees.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
However, many of them do not have a high school degree.
"Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert of the German Institute of Economics, is taking advantage of the opportunities for vocational training in the Saar region."
Young people gain further education in more than a fifth-year school, thus increasing the federal average by more than seven percent.
The combined opportunities for vocational training and higher education have also been well established.
The infrastructure for double studies is second-place in Germany in terms of population numbers.
Despite practical training and increasing interest, however, the number of senior engineers has decreased by one third in recent years.
The Island Ministry of Education has therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign focusing on engineering sciences.
"We initiated a number of reforms at primary schools after our first Pisa study," said a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has conducted comparative tests across the country.
To start learning earlier, the last school year is free of charge. It is a model that, in the meantime, the rest of the federal range began to copy.
To improve the performance of students permanently, only future comparative studies will respond.
According to the Pisa survey carried out in 2003, the risk-related student rate ranged from 29 to 20 %.
However, the performance of Saarland overall has not improved to the extent that other federal regions did.
The Bajorans count better.
On the contrary, foreign language awareness is not taken into account during the Pisa occupation of the island-regions - otherwise, they could be maimed in this area,
Because the language of neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in high schools, even if the island regions are not French.
Chávez transfers the watches
In Venezuela, classes are different from those in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will be turning the time gauges back in the Latin American country half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez became a laugh in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela stated, under a new law, the clocks will be turned back four and a half hours from the time of Greenwichi.
In this way, the South American State will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The United States anti-Chavez has, among other things, justified its decision to force the United States to force time zones based on all hours.
Chávez also announced, on Wednesday (local time), the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
The nationalist politician on the left said that until the conservative President of Alvaro Uri remains in Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian government maintains contact.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the country of oil must make an opinion on Sunday within the framework of a referendum.
With the reform, it would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe’s decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe's decision to "strip" Venezuela gave him a voice in his criticism of Chávez's Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new cell phone call has emerged: "Por qué no te Callas" (Why don't you say your mouth) - that's how the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
The sentence comes from King Károly of Spain, who was so upset at the last Latin America Summit that the popular politicians of Balladian were constantly saying that he had been cut into its word.
The Germans are threatened by wage cuts in 2007
According to one forecast, real wage cuts threaten German workers this year despite a strong policy.
Experts have reduced their pessimistic forecasts on a large number of reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler report, in 2007, employees can actually calculate a lower salary than in the previous year.
"The reason for these modest wage developments, the increase in the general turnover tax and the rapid increase in food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn, a member of the Institute for Macroeconomic Research and Economic Research.
There may also be new burdens on workers in terms of unemployment insurance.
Mr Peer Steinbrück, Minister of Finance, stated in his statement to the newspaper "Nue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that in the current situation, the reduction of correct and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be placed in such a difficult situation as to apply for credit or support to the Federation, quoted the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician.
It became known on Tuesday that the flooding of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation of 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3 per cent in a year.
Venus is the evil twin of Earth
Despite Venus' Zord atmosphere, it is more like the Earth than it has been expected so far: in its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" space probe flashes and windstorms were discovered on its corners than they were in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades scientists have assumed that Venus would flash.
The European "Venus Express" probe provided evidence of electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings in Venus spread from clouds to clouds at a height of 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russel, a member of the California University of Loss Angeles.
According to the famous "strong theory", the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightnings: Theoria said that the Zatiars had introduced reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amines, the building blocks of life.
Not like Venus: "If ever there was life there, it could be in very early times," explains Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegie Institute.
Currently there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is round and thicker than the Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the hell's twin brother on Earth, but he's his twin brother", said Russel.
The main question of Esa sending to Earth is why so similar Venus is going on a development path that is different in its entirety.
"Venus Express" was a milestone in the Venus Research in November 2005, because since the early '90s, no probe was on its way to search this planet.
The latest research results presented in more "Nature" articles, according to researchers, not only demonstrate the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They're also saying that the proximity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we thought it was the first time," said Esa.
In addition to the already known North-Sark Roundwind, researchers have discovered a much faster moving cloud on the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds us of the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, claims that the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute Istituto di Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system is almost the same as the Earth, with its 12.100 kilometres diameter almost as the size of the Earth.
Even the celestial body called the Evening Star will be avoided in just 225 days.
However, you turn a lot slower around your step: it lasts for 243 Earth days on a Venus Day.
Although the surface temperature of Venus at 92 bar pressure is hardly similar to that of Celsius 460, scientists begin to see that both planets were created under completely similar conditions.
Both of them had accumulated water that remained on earth as oceans until Venus left into the universe.
And while carbon dioxide is in the carbon fields on Earth, Venus is a major part of this atmosphere.
She's defending Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, is calling for the end of the debate between the parties that broke down around his reception in Dalai Lama's Chancellor's office.
He was critical of the SPD in a way that he attacked the Chancellor after the September reception.
Mr Köhler, President of the German Republic, is concerned about the authority of Germany and called on the large coalition to complete the debate that was opened around the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not appear as a shared nation in this matter towards the outside world," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding of the fact that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
"The human rights are universally valid to me even if I respect the diversity of cultures", Köhler signed it.
Everyone is aware that Germany has to take care of the politically delicate balance, stressed the President of the Republic; however Merkel has been defending the accusation that the Chancellor would conduct a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional "One China" policy.
China is also aware of this," Köhler put it down.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD) has indirectly expressed his disapproval of Dalai Lama and has therefore become a target for attacks in the EU.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "rich policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the acceptance of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office, severe disturbances occurred in the German-China situation.
Thus, Chinese leadership has not only returned to the invitation of German Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the information of SPIGEL, also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Chinese Head of State Wen Jiabao has now called on Angela Merkel's Federal Chancellor to admit that it was a mistake to receive the Dalai Lama.
China rejects the acceptance by European politicians of the religious leader of Tibetans in their official quality, and confirmed the Chinese position Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have shown that they are trying to break up further Tibetan areas from China, including Tibet and other provinces today.
Schäuble should be protected from disturbances similar to those in France.
Street collisions with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against disturbances similar to those in France.
Everything must be done so that social discontent in Germany does not go into street violence, requires the Federal Minister of Interior.
Barricades have been flamed, randomists have shot at the police with a beer rifle: after the severe riots of young people in France, the Federal Minister of Interior of Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany is a similar development.
"We need to ensure that social explosives are not accumulated at our place and that they do not go into violence.
We have to be serious about this," said the "Nue Presse" newspaper in Hannover.
Not all young people are adapted to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problematic cases, said Schäuble.
This does not only concern the integration of immigrants.
"From the accession summit to the Islamic Conference, the first success has been made."
But it's too early to clear the emergency.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, over the last night, young people fought serious street fighting with the police.
Cars and public buildings were on fire in Toulouse.
Taking this into account, integration required greater activity from the federal government, Kenan Kolat, head of the German Turkish communities.
Kolat warned about the dangers of recuperation in France.
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
Still, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 from migrant families is "higher than average".
Above all, more education should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a vision."
However, the head of the Turkish Community said that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: "We must still be alert."
For young people, "the faster they need to be able to work and receive education".
Meanwhile, in Paris's suburbs, in Villiers-le-Bel during the night there was complete peace.
Hundreds of police officers were ready for deployment, and a helicopter equipped with headlights had to put the area in place.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and some flame-reflecting particles and cars.
Since reporting, a round of 1000-person security units provide peace.
The police are ready for intervention as long as necessary, he announced Minister of the Interior of Michelle Alliot-Marie after his visit to the city.
During the night that broke down on Tuesday, 80 police officers were wounded due to the riots in wilders-le-bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The revolutions occurred in a traffic accident, during which two young people lost their lives on Sundays.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Clouded in Angela’s Empire
The action of the Chancellor from reality is proof that the coalition is at its end - and nothing is expected of it.
In fact, in which country does the Federal Chancellor live?
After a general debate on the Bundestag, it must be established that it is not here - not in the country whose governance would be their responsibility - that is to say nothing.
He rejected the charge with a very urgent statement, Angela Merkel, to focus too much on foreign policy.
It's provincial, he replied, and in this way he's only given the expression that he doesn't want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, it made it clear to everyone how much we can find.
Meanwhile, there was no specific interest or empathy for the country’s problems.
Instead, Angela Cloudy came up: a politician from reality who fled to foreign politics, and there is only uncertainty.
An example of climate protection: Heiligendamm is unbridledly praising himself, but he is listening to how the goals of climatization should be achieved in the country.
In any case, as far as self-respect is concerned, such modesty would not have been granted two years earlier by the Presidency of the CDU.
Now he's working on the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
It's a pragmatism that's got the good news of being a pragmatist who's got a solution to the problems instead of the covets.
However, in the emerging Angela’s empire, domestic policy problems are only side effects.
Child poverty and low income problems?
It only serves a few words.
In this respect, it is important to note the extent to which language breaks are involved when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel has three times to get him to put together a half-way sentence.
If it's any particulars, it's in an alien area.
Case Division of Roham
During the debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube, the two Favorits, Rudy Giulian and Mitt Romney, they have now had a tough change from an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already on the surface with regard to the first subject.
Mitt Romney tells opponents Rudy Giuliani that he made New York a "governance for illegal immigrants".
For those of us who are contemplating with serious facts: "I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants", take Giuliani back, and throw it back into the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts, that he was employed as a private man by undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are starting to attack: As the Republican camp still has no unified support for its fans, the eight presidential waiters use the debate on CNN above all to undermine the loan of its opponent.
The 30-second videos sent by internet users through Youtube are hardly more than short summaries.
"We have brought Hitler into power with this type of Isolacionism," says John McCain, his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one who demands immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by Vietnam's vet when he's attracted to condemning the so-called "Waterboarding" as a torture, the method of interrogation that simulate water spraying.
However, the important topics of the campaign are not only in discussions on Iraq and torture, but also in response to the public in Florida, St. Petersburg.
Sound taps are broken in the hall while conservative values are praised and when future tax increases are rejected.
Meanwhile, the two candidates are becoming more and more exposed.
"I was wrong at the time," said Romney, and apologized to the supporters and television viewers for putting down the box in 1994 for breaking the pregnancy.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is fluctuating when asked for his opinion on the Bible’s literal interpretation.
Musharraf first ruled as a civilian
One day after his return from the front of the army, Musharraf took office as President of Pakistan exercising authority.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Mr Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took place on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television was transmitted live from the capital, from the President's palace in Islam.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to the benefit of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed the international pressure to come from the United States.
After eight years of defeating power in the form of a military coup, the former general now rules as the first-time civil Head of State.
Musharraf has fulfilled a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition by returning to the chief commander of the armed forces.
Another important demand is the elimination of the state of emergency announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Chief Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayum, Musharraf will no longer be able to eliminate the state of emergency, which will meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf, in early November, had planted with him the protests of the state's re-election of 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four were injured as a result of an attack on a military convoy in northern Vosiristan in the tribal area.
According to the information reported by the military spokesperson, the bomb exploded on a route near the Afghanistan border.
Fathers of krautrock will return
The German super team of the 70s is playing again: The three gang members of Harmonia have re-created their musical instruments to the power of a concert in Berlin.
On the occasion of the reunion, a recorded recording will appear from their light age, the "Live 1974" time.
They were already well known abroad at that time.
The notified sensation is the body of three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Before each one, his own instrument, his own cable, and everything in front of his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius has spent 63 years in a snow white shirt in the middle of the throne.
From the left, Michael Rother, who is 57 years old, offers a ride for a laptop and guitar.
From the audience's right point of view, he's 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius and concentrate on the console.
Each one of them produces some kind of noise, along with a one-time rhythm.
And all of this, sometimes it's like, by chance, a traditional music.
But all of this does not seem to bother the lords in particular.
It was a great pleasure for krautrock music leaders that the Harmonia band was re-playing.
What we can tell here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has fallen through the collective popular memory, but in no case has left no lasting clues that we will miss this band painfully after 32 years.
But why shouldn't the Germans celebrate the living legends of their 70s?
Especially that what we call a misguided krautrock has always been appreciated more in England and America than in his own country.
When the music industry still awarded the Echo Prize for Life in 2003 to members of the Jubilee Can band, the German pops in the hall were sitting with an inexplicable face.
When La Düsseldorf and Neu! even thanked the bands in Red Hot Chili Peppers' studio, the surprise has become unlimited.
At the concerts, Michael Rother was sitting on stage as an old buddy with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The two sides of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are the same coin.
Harmonia is already overburdening the memory because the trio only existed for two years, and during that time it had a smaller effect than others attributed it to him after that time.
Moebius and Roedelius used to play with Conrad Schnitzler as an artistor under the name of the great promising Cluster.
They first played in the basement under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, from economic considerations, a record company financed by the Church.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and at the same time it was perhaps the most radical German band, the Neu! guitarist.
However, in 1973, Rother followed Cluster’s musicians into their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, at Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rom lived as a commuary escaped from town.
It's less ideological than the I. comms where Roedelius was still dealing as a sitter.
Their lives are more like idyllic art.
It's reported that the flag of the Harmonia Ottostein Dalár and that's how they found names for their art.
Some of these things have been recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band needed money.
The stock collection alone did not ensure that we found ourselves.
The CD in "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of an audience with only 50 records, so someone remembers it.
Harmonia's efforts and occasionally practice were the idea of Roth at that time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The gang announced its distribution in 1975.
Rother made up at the Esoteric and held himself on albums like "Flamnde Herzen".
Cluster was revitalized in the eighth century, which has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
The live album in Grissem is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
The student's album company for Greenland's name was designed to care for the krautrock as a special German contribution to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been used as well as Roedelius' solo work.
Harmonia is being resurrected at the Berlin House of Cultures.
In public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of our British sister and the book "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
And here's the idea manager for Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
This outlines about the effect of krautrock on the next Popzene era.
In this respect, Harmonia will fill the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno, together with the most unusual sounds, sleeps in the room: "The only true music, has the future."
There are images that portray the producer with Harmonia in a peasant's room.
Other black-and-white photographs of the cable equipment are designed for legendary construction.
In the lobby, the three veterans are reserving with improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are fixed to the organ and drum equipment with the intention of using the instruments themselves to produce sound effects that have not yet been heard.
Today, electrical music looks like electrical music.
It's three, deep in technique.
Even the houseworship doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenstern's command, they're coughing and squeezing, and in a beautiful part they're singing "Aaaaaaah."
For krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here screams "'68", it doesn't go all wrong, and Harmonia won't even let herself get away with it right now.
They even think about the most obvious thing on stage.
Where does the music begin, and where does it end?
This might just keep a eye on the man, or give him some of his extraordinary moments of luck.
Richard Gere just isn't Chinese enough
Through "Warning" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films are once again dealt with the Balkan war.
But none of them are convincing.
The idea is either too emotional for action and shooting.
You can't even help Richard Gere at "The Hunting."
First of all, the good news is that although the two war criminals, Karadics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found him again in the dark back of the war in Bosnia, Richard Gere.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the Eighth Years, since many good-boy-semi-semi-semi-semi-stakes in emotional films for women and many press conferences in the theme of Buddhism have even taken our pleasure to see it.
And here, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most overwhelming argument that maybe we'll just watch "The Hunting" movie.
It offers a wonderful, smiling formation: basically, Simon Hunt, a warist who was formed by him, is exactly what Gere would have become if fate and the film industry were not so merciful as to: A man who had abandoned his most beautiful years long ago, but his decline as a romantic monument still kept a significant part of his former attraction.
However, the film "The Hunting" and also the German "Mörderischer Frieden" production started this week continue only the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war, despite this.
We do not have to waste much of the movie "Mörderische Frieden": the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel) who are saving a Serbian woman from the Koszovan orphans, and one of them is suddenly in love with it.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all bad movies, the film that carries the weakness of TV is lost too quickly in shooting and event-stamped scenes.
"Cobra 11"-jelleget is carrying war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, it is exemplary to examine why no really good movie has been produced in the Balkans.
The history of the three war scientists in the United States, who are plowing up to explore Serbian war criminal by the name of "Roka", with a different director, a different scriptwriter (both Richard Shepard's Personal Union) could have turned into a new "Apocalypse now" at a different age.
For stories show a surprising similarity: in both cases small groups will cut him into the forest to do what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the journey to madness will go on.
One of the reasons for the fall of "The Hunting" is that he simply doesn't let Simon Hunt be a student in his heart, a cinic student, as he shows him at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spent a romantic relationship with a woman of Muslim witches who later murdered him.
The "Abstinence" slips away at a time when the reporters, in the last five minutes of the film, achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s main hunters were unable to do in five years: they will take the war criminal and hand him over to the Mohamedian bos for righteous revenge.
It's so bad that you'd rather go to the Hague International Criminal Court because of the crime against the cinema's logic.
But the purpose of the film is deeply human.
They intend to put Karadjics and Mladics on the loose and suspect the Americans and French (which is said to be exceptionally united) that, because of secret political agreements, they do not pursue persecution in an intensive manner.
But good and evil sometimes resemble each other so much that a man's famous Brecht hit his mind.
This poet writes the following about an Asian demon on his desk: "I am staring down on the fish of the larvae, which tells us: how tiring it is to be evil".
Films like "Waring" have masks of just as oversized human head, but they show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the art of films about the Balkans war.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all the Hollywood films on Iraq were a huge fall.
We can add: We haven't had any good films about South Africa yet.
It's almost always valid: If a star goes through the world's crisis fields or mine fields, it's like "on the paths of freedom" with Patricia Arquette, Angelina Jolie or "The Blood diamond" Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
They had to spend decades while Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the holocaust with the Schindler list.
Some films are probably still available - because the films about the Vietnam War are already classic works, such as "the deer hunter", "Apocalypse now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not celebrated in their time as a masterpiece.
But it can be imagined that today, when all mass killings arrive in our home in real time, on two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts in the world.
And it deprives script writers of the ignorement of reality, which would be necessary to tell good stories.
Because "Lenni or not" or "The dictator" eventually got so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do the right thing if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we should place the novelist Lawrence Norfolk in a sarcastically distant artistic vision.
When the historical novel of "Lemprière-lexicon" and his parallels between the Balkan war, he answered, "It only depends that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Von Beusto is highly criticised for the loss of the Olympics.
The mayor’s proposal to organise the Olympic Games in Hamburg gave rise to serious criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to keep fighting for water games.
On the other hand, Von Beaut is a forceful warning of reality during the opportunity.
On Wednesday Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, he regarded the withdrawal as "favorous to the economic environment".
No other project has recently released so great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
Without this goal, we could not keep a level playing field in sport."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative, "which comes out of modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust, in addition to his earlier statements that his ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg were not realistic until at least 2028.
"Never Hamburg decides on the Olympic tender, but the German Olympic Sports Association", said von Beaut to WELT ONLINE.
He has made a trip to the decision of the Sports Association before the beginning of December 2018 on the Munich tender submitted for the Games in the Winter Olympic Games.
"The preference for this means that we will not have real chances within the 2028 period that we have thought about."
However, we do not give up the dream at all, said von Beaut.
The Hamburg Sport Association (HSB) expressed its regret at the statements made by von Beaut.
This gives the impression that Hamburg is not going to apply for the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It's too soon to fall for an opportunity to bury our plans now," said Günter Ploß, Chairman of HSB, Wednesday.
It is contrary to the statement by the Senate president at the General Assembly of the German College of Sports.
In fact, the 2015 Univerziaadéra tender for the city of Von Best Hamburg described that it was not a supplement to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College of Sports has only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition in the last week.
The civilian section of the SPD has warned the Senate that it has left a valuable time in terms of housing construction in Hamburg unexploited.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years, for he has been lying next to the Olympics and ignoring the housing construction", said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While SPD has constantly broken fire along with an integrated plan for the Olympic and later residential exploitation of Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU has placed emphasis on the "event factor" on one side.
The competition for the Summer Olympic Games in 2012 was a great enthusiasm at the time in Hamburg.
Still, he fell in Hamburg Lipcse.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and the wall to each other is Ikea, and he's not thinking about Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently manufactured villages in Sweden list the works of Warhol, a dark shadow.
Most of the nineties listed in this list are "Sockholm Type" Brillo Box forgery.
After the Swedish "Expressen" page for a few months, Andy Warhol questioned the originality of Brillo Boxes in 1968, and now the internal investigation of the modern modern Museet of Stockholm came to an astounding result: The six copies "Brillo Box" donated by Pontus Hultén, former museum director to Moderna Museet in 1995 - and most likely on the round on the international art market for hundreds of more "Stockholm" Brillo Box.
The prehistoric is a long and complicated chain of artistic and diaphorium mutations.
Warhol was created in New York in 1964 by the first painted walls based on the red and blue and white design of the "Brillo" soap powder cardboard box.
At an exhibition held in Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes were made out of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost savings reasons) but were transported directly from the Brillo Carton factory.
It wasn't work of art, it was about the templates, it was just exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol authorised the production of some Brillo haladas in Sweden in 1968, but these were not issued in Moderna Museet.
The early witnesses are now talking about 15 boxes that were legally incorporated into the history of art and auction as certified Original-Andy-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the name "Stockholm".
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director later claimed that in 1968 hundreds of villages were produced and produced in Sweden, which was then left to Warhol.
In fact, only 105 boxes of Hultén were manufactured in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in Saint-Pétervár.
At that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six boxes owned by Brillo Box, Lars Byström, the main estate manager of Moderna Museet also examined three boxes of Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pre-printed tiles were first grounded and kissed, and then the white oil painting was then brought up with a cut.
The structure of the copies from 1990 states that the paint was taken with a paint cylinder, without a foundation, directly onto the sheet, and not on oil, but on acrylic paint.
"These boxes are not certified by the artist and should therefore be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, Director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the New York Warhol Art Authority Board decides otherwise, Moderna Muse will classify six boxes in its collection as a copy/output material."
Of course, the Authority Board has announced in June that it will investigate the 'several charges' in relation to soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have been inconsistency to listen.
Manila rebel soldiers surrender
The rebels were given up in the Philippines by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a Manila Hotel and called for the arrest of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for bloodshed, told reporters about his leader at the hotel, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, the hotel was attacked by government-stamped soldiers.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricade in the building for hours.
Half of the team was court-martialed on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve the wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police entrusted with the man's custody clearly joined him and joined the ceremony.
They went into the Peninsula Hotel and then called for the arrest of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government units have locked down the front of the hotel.
The president called the security office to an emergency meeting.
Norberto Gonzales was a security consultant for the military procedure.
"They have enough for people," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, former commander of the Scout Rangers elite, declared that other military units wanted to join in a short time.
On Friday, critics of the government called for a strong protest against the presidency.
His government has been shattered by corruption charges several months ago.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene in 2003 for its military training experiment against Arroyo organized by 200 members of the army.
At least 24 hours later, the rebellion failed when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986 at least seven fancy attempts have already been made against the democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet will be a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has provided its own share of more than 20 percent in Versatel telecommunications.
As stated on Wednesday evening, the average stock price is EUR 14,46.
This represents the equity of 20.05 per cent.
Before that reception, there were some discoveries on the wing.
The possibility of increasing the share of assets acquired in Versatel remains open.
By this step, they want to promote consolidation of the German DSL market, reported the United Internet.
Before that, there have been assumptions on Wednesday about possible integration after the Bank of Berenberg increased its existing share in the Dysseldorf network service by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.

However, the two companies leave all options open, in particular to increase their stake in Freenet AG, the news is.

So far, the United Internet and the Gillisch holding company had a direct share of 6.01 per cent in Freenet.
