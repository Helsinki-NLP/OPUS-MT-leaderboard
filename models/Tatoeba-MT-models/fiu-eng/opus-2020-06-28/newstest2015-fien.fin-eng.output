The city of Juankoski is linked to Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the alliance last week.
The municipal union was also involved in the settlement of the municipality of Tuusniemi, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue on its own.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the following municipalities separately.
Municipal elections will be held next year in 2016.
After the juankoski accession, Kuopio's population is about 111,000.

India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, President Putin accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing direct political discussions with the separatists of Eastern Ukraine.
The current Kyoto leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the east of its country, according to Putin, according to the Itar-Tass Office.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, whom Kiev and the West say are being assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions where Putin said that Ukrainian military troops were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push these armed forces and their troops away so that they do not get the chance to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmikojam.
It surprised me that the crowd came from the beginning.
There were visitors in two days looking forward to it. Promottor Tom Kangas tells us.
Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year, again.
We're still going to be hippop-festarians, so pops aren't allowed, Kangas will convince us.
On Tuesday, Finland will enter into force a law limiting the purchase of explosives that are suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply for permission from the police administration to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as explosives from the source.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitrogenic acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and mixtures containing sodium perchlorate, if the concentration values specified are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is contained in cleaning and washing materials, but concentrations generally do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, at an acceleration time.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the law may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Valoliiga: Super Raheem spell - Mario remained in shadow - Valoliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19 years old Raheem Sterling again showed why he was considered a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday, when Mario Balotel confirmed Liverpool came to visit Tottenham.
Super Marion's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than at Manchester City.
The Balotel was still far from its peak current.
The Italian lost three high-quality sites and fed only half of its sixteen to its own team.
The half-scans who already took the player's favorite will be better in the future.
The Liverpool Manageri Brendan Rodgers planted the Balotel in Barcelona, on his journey to Luis Suarez's role as second attacker to the team Daniel Sturridge.
As the team's star, instead of Balotell, Rahem Sterling, the head of the medium field diamond, ran the important opening goal of the 3-0 victory past Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it's not just the light that's working.
Ballotel 20 cents shorter English is between the lines of the opponent than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who thanks the grass at best for about 34 kilometers an hour.
Rodgers also deserves a great thank you for the development of Sterling.
After the match, the Northern Irelandn reported how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive machine player of a bullet London that has grown at Wembley's root.

Government of employees' organisations to collect pension talks - Domestic - Regions - News - Karelian
At the same time, we are looking for a new pace in the negotiations on pensions in our own social partners' meetings today.
In the morning, the governments of the SAK, Akava and STKT will discuss the negotiating situation.
It is then intended to continue the actual pension negotiations.
The labour market organisations have, among other things, been in dispute about the binding of their retirement age to life expectancy.
They have promised a working career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate it would be born this week.
In the attic.
The Rovaniemean female volley's league team, Woman Volley, tripped the leagues to the Vampulan Sports Clubs, Puppeted in the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
The vampire turned to five of the 3-2 winnings of a stretched match.
The last batch of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead of us all the time.
The fight was good, but the defense game and the pass game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVon's hexa was so risamed that the 190-cent American senator Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the back side.
The senator played Sara Niem.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play and formed Johanna Pekkarinen with WoVo's most powerful combination.
Jenna Kessämägi, who started the Hakkuri, could make room for Jana Jaudzeme for the last 1.5 batch.
The best part of the vampire was a skilled Russian pastor as well as a libero Hillael in Hämäläinen, which WoVo twisted as much as possible.
WoVon’s preparation for the league will continue next week as HPK comes to Rovaniemi in Hämeenlinna.
The team will meet on Saturday at 18 a.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, we'll meet at the Sports College for a second time.

Anthrax cancer is most frequently fatal due to delayed diagnosis and poor treatment in less favoured regions
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video for her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at greater risk of dying of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the patient data of more than 1,100 Australian women receiving ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and noted that only 35 % of women, or more than five years after diagnosis.
The main researcher, Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas died by 20% during the study than women living in urban areas.
INJURY: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history seven years ago.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the chance of survival.
In older women and cancer, the lowest probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was the more widespread.
In rare populated and remote areas, women died more likely than women living in urban areas during the study.
The study did not try to determine why women living outside the cities are less likely to cope with ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers that possible causes of delayed diagnosis and poor treatment.
"Specific doctors in Gynecological Oncology best treat this disease, and their reception is mostly located in large cities", says Jordan.
While treatment as remote services is becoming more widespread and the importance of the distance is reduced, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialist doctors can manage patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients who are far away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's survey, the long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In a family mother at the age of 33 in March 2012, in Gold Coast, Elisha Neave, a malignant ovarian cancer was observed.
The town of Rovaniemi wishes to strengthen the station plan in the friendly park, located next to the hotel in Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposed position plan of the Civil Society Park and its nearby environment would be set at Osvitta, a service point to be seen publicly.
Opinions on the proposed formula are requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Food Centre.
With the help of the changing position, the city wishes to make it possible to continue motor skills related to tourism in the area.
The purpose of the park is to form a park area that includes the area between the current Civil Society Park and its and the river.
On the spot, no more than 200 motor vehicles shall be permanently authorised for the period 15 November to 30 April.
The designated section may also be located at refuelling points.
A new park area is also allowed for maintenance services.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the territory of the friendship park to safari companies for snowmobiles during the winter season.
The lease agreement was renewed in spring 2014 and the lease was in force in spring 2018.
The strong opposition has been raised in the development of good environmental management and design change.
The residents of the neighbouring regions have been all over their voices as well as concerned about their emissions.
However, the region's emissions have been examined and no observations have been made in excess of the guidelines.
The renewed stock is also more low-emissioned than it was.
The park of friendship is also supported by the fact that if the location of departure was moved further, safari customers of the hotel should carry a bus that is estimated to be 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surroundings of the friendly park are also broad enough, better than the places of departure for replacement, such as the eastern side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
A friendly park is also good for its location because activities will be able to expand in the future, for example, into the Ounaspaviljonki region.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy approved by the City Council of Rovaniemi, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business by providing sufficient quality areas for logistics and functionally affordable places.
A friendly park is also marked as the starting point for engine training in the central part of the plan, which has not yet received legal power.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is shown in garden stores
The decline in the number of residential owners, especially in the 35-year-old group, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, when young consumers today reach their age in terms of the "main target group" of garden sales.
According to the Financial Times report, housing subscribers spend only 55 per cent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in very urban areas with no gardens, and the size of the garden is further reduced when the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking spot, and these factors also threaten the garden area with an estimated value of about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the London major area, housing ownership has decreased from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products are used for the smallest amount of money in the whole country.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in renting housing or the reduction in garden size does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
The leading garden counselor for RHS, Guy Barter, says, "For example, plants in transferable housing tanks are particularly popular among housing subscribers, as such farming containers can be included if necessary in their change".
According to the HTA report, over the years 1997-2005, re-sales in the garden sector were dwindling, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the end of the 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will become more active this year thanks to better weather conditions, with last year's March and April weather being poor.
Turkey is questioning US diplomacy for the spy report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat report on American and British spying in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Embassy attorney and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German Der Spiegel magazine and website The Intercept have written that the documents issued by the former analyst Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main spy destination of the US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news offices, Turkish President Recep Tayyp Erdogan reduced the importance of the report, saying that all major countries have been spying on each other.
The previous report on spying in Ankara, the German main intelligence service, had a more angry reaction to the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in a new Finnish film
The Canadian actor Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several success stories, has been attached to the female capital in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays a director in Mikko Kuparinen's film for 2 nights in the morning, with photos starting this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Best Women's Head of the Cannes Film Festival for his role in the film's Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film in Munich and Julian Schnabel's film in the Perhone glass picture.
There's Mikko Nousiainen on the man-head of the 2 nights movie.
The film receives Finland’s first night in September 2015.
Mr Mallorcan Magaluf's chief of police accused of corruption
On Friday, the police and Calvià city government officials presented evidence of blackmail at the Office of the General Public Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The Calvià police chief on Mallorca's holiday island has been arrested as a result of the acts of corruption presented by Magaluf's operating and barowners.
Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several owners of Punta Ballena have filed corruption charges against him. Punta Ballena is located most of Magaluf's bars and night clubs.
According to the daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the case was reported by the police and the local government officials of Calvià, on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are interviewed by the judge together with Navarro.
Throughout the country, ABC wrote about the partiality of the public authorities who were angry with the owners of nightclubs, which significantly affected their business.
"There is no more money in this case, but there is a survival," a businessman told the Court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the headlines this summer when the YouTube video was broadcast online, where a 18-year-old British holidayer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawlin.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to control the horrific and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidayers by reducing the number of participants in malignant, alcoholic pub crawl.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the night club owner and the pub crawl organiser Carnage were jointly ordered to pay EUR 55 000 fines.
Above all, among young British tourists, the popular Magaluf tourist destination has become popular also the so-called Balconing trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from balcony to other or balcony in the hotel’s pool.
The children of Israel return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after having taken the summer bombers, when rockets and grenades bombed their communities for 50 days in the war between Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed as the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the communities of southern Israel bombarded by rockets, but the traces of the battles are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod in the south, Pashosh, workers removed fragments from the walls and slides before the children entered the rocket’s home.
"We're a little scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in the kibbuts, Israeli communists, and works as an English teacher at the school of the city.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart thinks she'll be back at school for a long time and she'll feel "a little weird."
"We've had difficult times sometimes when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts border of Gaza with his support.
Before last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of regions of the Saami border area had kept indoors or left their homes for safer territories from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the community in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip, Nahal Oz, are skeptical about the return of Palestinian grenades killed in the community of a 4-year-old boy.
According to the Department of Education, the fair ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, near the Gaza Strip, a city targeted by a heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children' training and safety will be ensured".
Israel and Hamas agreed on the ceasefire that was still in force last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fight, but it did not bring about a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the removal of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of Gazan air and sea routes.
Israel wants to take away Hamas's weapons and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of the dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although they had no lasting evidence of this.
On Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including Thai workers.
Hamas and other Gazaese soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities mostly in the south.
In turn, more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks were carried out by the Israeli army.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and estimated 250 000 people fled to a school maintained by the UN, which had been converted into temporary shelters.
Ten thousand people while still in protective custody and while fighting, school authorities moved the school early last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old at a school in shelter in Gaza City.
According to the commonly used meter, house prices have risen to the highest seven years during the Australia winter months.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic apartments in the capital of Australia rose by 1.1 per cent in August, showing data from RP on Monday.
As a result, the increase in prices during the summer, July and August was 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily around the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RR Data Research Manager, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data's results show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the next busiest, with an average price increase of five to six per cent.
The lowest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia has increased the number of dwellings in sales over the coming months, which is a real test on the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the generally lively volume of sales and the continued low level of interest rates, it is likely that there will continue to be an increase in house prices over the next three months", says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mäntta
New museum and art have drawn record audiences this summer to Mäntta.
More than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
A new Gösta museum was opened in June and it has included classical works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä's art weeks told us that he made a visitor record on Monday when 14 500 people visited this summer.
These numbers have not been used.
The people have been pouring out doors and windows," says Pauli Sivonen of Serlachius.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors throughout the year will come at Serlachius Museums this year to approach 100 thousand.
In previous years, there have been some 40,000 visitors.
Mäntta-Vilpula has around 11 000 inhabitants in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä.
The director of the museum Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always opening phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In the hill, it is hoped that the season of art will continue far beyond summer.
In the autumn art museum, new exhibitions will be opened.
The police are investigating four thefts in Kajaan last few days.
On Sunday night, in Pohjolandu, commercial property was broken by breaking a window.
The killer had received a small amount of money from the cash machine.
Between Thursday and Monday, the Syväojanka Street had stolen fuel from the tank of the truck.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday the boat had been taken from the boat to the back of the boat.
The rowboat was a Kalapalta-marked outdoor light and floating inside.
In the interior, the word "OVA" was read on the back of the back of the door.
A couple of suspects stole the police already had time to catch.
On Sunday night in Tikkupuronti, commercial property was broken.
The police dog got a print and a 20-year-old paltamoman found under a tree hiding in the woods.
On Monday, the police caught another man from Palmamos, who is also suspected of being murdered in the same break.
Lost amfetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to a man born in 1977.
According to the D.A., the man had gone to his apartment with his co-op and another man and shot with a shotgun as a drug exporter, a 34-year-old kajaani woman.
The defendant contested the charge and claimed to be another man with him.
The case came to the police when the police patrol stopped a passenger car with a company burning clothes used in the blood work.
In addition to burned wardrobes, a broken shotgun was found in the car.
The judgment will be given later on.
August was in many places a rare warm one.
According to the Institute of Air Science, one warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Air Science Institute statistics show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
The majority of the country's deviation was one step in two degrees.
Due to the heat of hay and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured during the first week of August in Pori, where the gauge showed 32,8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugmed me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in Dudley, a family of seven children from Jamaica, in the British Midlands district in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and the relationship between the boy and the father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy, which is based partly on his father's visit to a fictional conversation and developed on the basis of the radio channel 4 series.
The sound track is a mixture of rhino and rhino in the upbeat.
Henry's had to go through a bunch of cute childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he does much thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was very difficult for Dad to read.
He never saw her face, just a voice said, "Stop making noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the critiques now.
My parents, Seymour, and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed the form of a beer doctrine or the beauty of a croquette.
I never spoke to him about such things.
Most of my life he was to me the smileless man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal alloy in Dudley and thus gained an idea of what his father's life must have been like, even though working conditions are better than those at that time.
The slabs are a little more brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoked, maze-like depths, with flames, smoke and nappy, and which remind you of that.
My father used to go to baths and just lie in the tub, and slowly he began to sing for himself as he washed the melt away from himself.
As I walked around the Sulatato, I realized that he had worked for years to get us a food table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite this, Henry’s childhood was missing the closeness of his parents’ offer.
My father never hugged, never told me he loved me.
Not until my mother started to get sick a little before she died, we started to be in love with each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter Dawn French, and through his own child he has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mom's death.
When I started suffering from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
No one likes eating carrots.
Henry’s known, short beard may describe his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he has sunk to make the theater.
The next thing you're going to do was Ereddys' comedy and August Wilson's Fences ("Aids").
Doing the theatre offers a different experience than the lemons and comedys Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the field when he was only 16 years old, a factory worker.
One of the tidbits spotted him doing the simulations on the stage and contacted the New Faces Skills.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the '70s. "As long as I was the only black immator and a condom on TV," he says.
Henry learned how to work.
I was supposed to grow up in the light festivities of publicity, to learn how to produce jokes from slide straps in 1975 to 1985, while I was living on TV and being on TV, it was a difficult time.
The Lenny New Faces Skills Competition in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up in a comic program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I'd never been involved, but I don't regret it.
Even though my position was strange and wretched, I was able to work in huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet, the award-winning multi-annual favourite and light entertainment programme of the british-tv was at the same time a "created parade of black people".
Henry worked in the second comedy series in the '80s, where both he made a joke and he was admiring a black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as cook Gareth Blacklock in a comedy series with a Chef!
After the next decade Henry spent his time with ads, documents, TV series and movie parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What you're going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're only on site or on the sidelines."
Next thing you know, Radio 4 was the documentary series "What's So Great About...?"
The first part covered Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not actually properly taught at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that uses tights and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's theme raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, "Kake.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 provisions about Othello's last speech for the document, and he had been sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt almost like some part of me had been missing earlier, and now it was put in place.
"This is what this is all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your bag, do a little background check.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Soon thereafter, Henry was playing the main part at the Ereddys' comedy.
Suddenly, I was at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There were technical problems once in the play, and Henry clearly felt that his mission was to entertain the audience.
"A small voice in my mind said to me, "You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
On the other hand, the Director's assistant announced that the presentation will be continued as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me took care of the relief.
It's not my duty.
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in the role"
Henry's "Fences" play at the Duchess Theatre
It's a challenge to learn how to play "Fences" Mountains.
Panic is a good thing. It makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign of the gods; "This is what you must do."
That's what Henry says, of course, in the sound of KUMEALA.
So I decided to stick around here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still essentially a comatose: small humorous boys continually interrupt our conversation when they change from imitation to imitation.
Absence of the Stand-up committee is a matter of will, as direct praise from the unknown public seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsty, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at Apollo Theatre when it feels that way, but in general, it doesn't inspire me the same way I used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on a new stand-up tour.
I find it a real joy to sit with a director who helps to edit the whole trip from the beginning, the middle and the end, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The exhibition keeps telling the story, and I enjoy it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya's creating a register of officials in order to remove "harm workers"
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of officials in trying to remove "harm workers" from the government's pay list.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks should no longer receive pay, were reported in the Government's notice.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after they have left their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenya promised to go through corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
Previously, according to an audit carried out this year, at least one million dollars were spent on the wages and other financial abuses of the "macular workers".
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or has left his official duty, reports by the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri, the capital city of Namibia.
All officials should report themselves to the registry in the identification centres over the next few weeks in order to ensure that their data are stored in a biometric form of registration, was reported in the Government's notice.
According to the press, anyone who fails to do this without a valid reason will be removed from the pay lists.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people actually perform their duties. In addition, it will clear the pay lists at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of "harm workers"," says Anne Waiguru, an official of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The result of the Wallajoki financial year 2015 may remain a deficit of EUR 25,5 million unless the city adapts its activities and expenditure developments in a tense economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual balance sheet is remaining at around 9.4 million deficits.
Possible ways of improving the scope and level of services were to be envisaged, to purchase services, to sell property and to increase tax and payment products.
The EUR 10 million target for investments is EUR 8.5 million.
There is no clear relief in the situation of municipalities.
The new municipal obligations, insufficient tax revenue growth, increased unemployment and a 5% cut in state contributions further weaken the outlook.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be achieved.
The ship must be translated into the strategy’s objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Government.
The city administration returned the presentations made for the preparation of the board of directors.
The city government's proposals are based on the preparation of the budget in the delegation's economic seminar at Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the Presidency seminar, the draft budget will proceed through the Board of Governors to the City Board and to the City Council.
Tens of Turkish police arrested as suspects against the "joon" government
All 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects for the anti-government plot, and local media sources report.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurryiet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with last December's corruption investigations, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey, accused of organising a large-scale criminal gang and monitoring telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who acted as Prime Minister during that period) said that police activities are part of the Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen's planned action against him and others in power.
Not all children will return to school in Ukraine
Most of the Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally significant day for families, and like thousands of Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took her daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting journalists that not all schools opened up again, but he said that he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not spent in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexander Patuthov, a leading teacher in Slaviansk School, spoke Russian, where Yassenyuk's daughter goes.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will learn what will benefit them in the future.
The celebration of the first day of school are traditionally children’s written shirts, balloons, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry says that the grueling twist was unauthorized.
On Sunday night, a brilliant picture of the district attorney of the Democrats was sent from Rick Perry, the Texas governor, when he heard the accusations of abuse of power.
Tweet was later removed, followed by a new Tweet, where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I do not accept Tweet and I have removed it", the subsequent publication said.
Perry's backup didn't respond immediately to requests for clarification.
Although the Tweet was sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the photo.
In April 2013, the first tweet included Travis district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of the DUC.
Perry stopped Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
Tweet's headline was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times allowed with bigger rates... but when that happens, Governor Perry of the cause with his finger".
I'm the drunkest democratic in Texas.
The Lehmberg Agency did not conduct a major jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, appointed by the Republican Judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called charges political.
His influential legal assistants have asked the court to dismiss the accusations and said that the law on which the governor who was most far-reaching in Texas was accused is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million of state aid to the State's state-owned non-inviolence department operating in Travis County and prosecuting the public sector when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Mr Perry's decision was received by an official complaint from the follow-up team on the matter.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After reaching the fifth meeting of Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by publishing a picture of himself on Twitter on the lake "This is coming, South Carolina!" with the text.
Berkeley stated that housing markets are "normal" again.
One of London's main builders has warned that the housing market in south-eastern England has been 'paid' to normal levels of activity.
Capital London’s housing has been plagued by huge demand and a sharp increase in prices, while a widespread spread of credit shortages has been feared, which led to restrictions imposed by the British bank on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, the founder of the high-level builder Berkeley and President Tony Pidgley said that "from the start of the current economic year the market and the number of shops have returned to normal after the peak of 2013" and added that this has enabled "a stable environment".
During the recession, the London housing market went well for foreign investors in their efforts to reach the capital.
According to the land register, prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only last year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average selling prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about the fifth year before, reaching a price increase of GBP 423 000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's property less attractive in recent months - some of its interest has also been affected by new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric of possible 'cartanotax' before the general elections in May.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the report on housing loans in April, which was reported on stricter loan orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth both in terms of sales volumes and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
On Monday, the latest data from the Bank of England showed that the number of loans accepted decreased in July, suggesting a cool housing market.
Property broker Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 forecast for London property prices. According to it, prices fall by three per cent because the price index of the owner's opinion on the prices has already started to decrease.
The number of transactions made in London in the most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped to the fourth year ago, the real estate broker WA Ellis says.
However, home demand in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which raised income from the properties sold to over GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, correct product has remained stable in the best locations and therefore sales have remained very busy".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3 742 new homes in the year before April, which is nearly a third more than at the time of the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual profits before taxes increased by 40% year-on-year, thus by 380 million pounds and net sales by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley stated that Berkeley's annual earnings correspond to the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is £450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock sold a flat price of GBP 23,96 in the London Stock Exchange.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards event.
A hacker who claims to hold his possession for a hundred other reasons was leaked by an Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet.
The hunger star representative confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker to "injure privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and all those who publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted.
The images that were originally published on the 4chan photo release page were apparently wrong because of the weakness of the Apple iCloud deposit system. A hundred other women are claimed to be tens of other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstread and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFed.
We don't know how much of these pictures are real, but Scott Pilgrim versus World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at me and my husband's house in privacy years ago, the images you took: I hope you have a good mind", Winstead twitat.
However, Victoria Justice, the Nickolodeon's "iCarly" series and "Victorious" series, denied the authenticity of the images and twitted that "the so-called naked pictures of me are not understood".
Let me finish this right now.
BuzzFedin announced late on Sunday that the representative of Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the pictures about the stars.
The only thing we have to do is take Howard Jacobson's thanks from a new novel that tells us about love and a j-book.
They slipped, it pictured what was best done, and gradually they cut off like a box of cardboard left out of the rain.
Only then did he hear from a woman that he was too serious, too difficult, intense, disconnected, and perhaps also a little squeaky.
That's when he threw his hand at me.
He recognized the pike.
Yeah, he was a squeaky, like a smoothie.
The last victim of his hide was the relationship that had been promising in the early days; it had seemed that this relationship could have made it easier for him to be lonely, and it might have brought his life even something of substance.
Solomons had unsustained hair and was a delicately tender beauty with a joyous heart, from a northern village, which was even worse and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling partner, which Kevern expected to be his aunt. Aunt had inherited a house that was located in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was accordingly Paradise Valley.
No one in the house had lived for years.
The pipes were leaked, there were spiders in all bathrooms, and the Etans had left their entire place in windows, and the garden grew with weeds that resembled giant cabbages.
The cabin was like the rain of the children, at the same time threatening and magical, the garden filled with secrets.
According to the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is subject to the Booker Prize in 2014.
Events will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Alilinin in a broken steel chair in the middle of a long haystack, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both listening dissatisfiedly to the reception through which the whole country heard relaxing music and calming news when Alilinn's crucified, sun-painted legs brought to Kevern's mind a song that had long since been singing the forgotten black performers and which his father had often listened to in the silhouettes of the cabin.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was really prohibited – they were not just called anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, as the word itself forgot.
Public opinion brought about what was not achieved by law and banishment: just as people in the corner of literature chose to read the memories, cookbooks and novels of the heroes, for music they favor the Ballads.
As the day was wilded, Kevern began to play a fictional piano and sing serenadia for the great Ailin feet with a loudly assembled voice.
I didn't understand.
"It was a jazz pianist Fats Waller's famous song," Kevern told him, and at the same time he naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
I saw his father do it all the time before he ran out of his lips in the "j" book.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father told me he was playing the same game as his own father.
If you let your mouth speak with j, and did not remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you would have to pay a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't even there.
He knew that it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
I've never heard anything like that before.
Jazz was not really a ban either, but it was not just a call.
Improvisive was no longer fashioned.
There was only room in life for one word.
When people started singing, they wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's been the same way that it had happened to him.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness presented through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's half-naked CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Alilin that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ainlinn, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
Even here, there was no need for law or coercion.
The hallucinating society meant that each part of it was accepted with gratitude — with gratitude, that they were like luck-saving — the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperature and physical characteristics, people with African-Caribbean family roots are best suited to entertain and sports, so they sing and run.
Originally, people from the Indian continent were like naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so it was their job to make sure that every family had a functional phone that was used to handle things.
Those remaining from the Polish community worked as pipelines; the last Greeks broke the plate.
When SE, when TAPAHTUI, JOS TAPAHTUI came true, they were from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of being rocked by flames and in fear of their next reaching them, they opened up restaurants that offered a labneh yogurt and burned up a water pipe, and continued to look down on the ground and bored.
Let everyone follow their gifts.
Only the ballads had been heard, and he was difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern just sang had never been dressed as music.
It's the music that said love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big feet think so.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound separation of giant leaves of potassium plants.
Still, I didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers with his lips.
I thought he was weird already.
"It was fun for Dad," he said instead.
I had no idea. I had no idea. I had no idea. I had no idea.
There's nothing more to see around the world than the enormous, shadowing hair-sleeved.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
I felt like I was genuinely confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
You got a ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"You're charming because of your thick ankles," she tried to fix it.
I'm twisted in that way.
This wasn't helping.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to make fun of himself, the effect was completely different, because he, like his father, did not have the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father was trying to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
In spite of her leprechaun eyes.
Solomons got red and rose up from his steel chair and at the same time poured out the receiver and poured out the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from the backseat, so he couldn't use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed shaking like palm trees in the storm.
"And your fat head is what twisted me into you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Alilinn, both because of his own unnecessary cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment Alilin decided to stand up against him.
Did she think she'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern of his life in an abandoned island in the north, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that, basically, it had been the same as life here.
It's the same huge, hyena sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, although even more pale and diabolical than their smugglers' parents, walked from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who dares to resist or blackmail them.
Fat head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
First suck – the most common word about kissing a man and woman’s erotic encounters had become; the receiver’s countermeasure to the unmistakable love balls pumping out — suck first and then attack.
Kevern also felt that it was too much, for already prayer itself was hostile.
The body language of Aliin Solomons told her to leave.
He pulled himself up from a steel chair like an old man.
Alilin also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s sorrow surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
I was following his going — just as his traveling partner watched Kevern go upstairs — a man who himself was responsible for his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who had turned his head, a fine, ashamed, ashamed man who had lost all the fighting will — why did he feel so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had seen it before this moment?
When Alilin Solomons was alone again, she looked at her legs.
For a few years before the event just described by a smart and zealous 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the general opinion in Ofnow, conducted a short study of the continuation of low- and medium-sized violence in the countries where the violence was reduced, or the end of it was most likely, given its use of money and energy.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "which can be offset for thousands of years by the natural aggression of the people who have fought and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote parts of the world, where, despite the chitorical places beyond the hedges, human leprosy is rarely known at the time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the moods it has created.
The people cry with sentimental ballads, obsessive stories of winning opposition and swears on the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps in unrestrained by both rural communities and urban societies, and there is also evidence of a new type of, more hostile fight in homes, workplaces, streets and even play parks.
"You have a unfortunate tendency to dramatize", his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
Besides, I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you gay?
Esme continued to appeal to his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I oppose atheism, lesbianity and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of unbiased society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectful in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, such as what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelness or evil - souled — others generally call natural energy and physical strength.
Making it look like it happened yesterday, if it happened all the time, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while talking to Rabinowitz.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flame-red LED-light declared a guide that Ofnow had already distributed to the country in the fourth quarter of the previous century or longer.
Smile for your neighbor, respect your partner, listen ballads, go to music, use your phone, discuss, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than quiet and the song is better than written, but nothing wins love.
"I understand what you want to say", Esme Nussbaum responded with a silent voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that, if we are not warned, we will find out that we are repeating the same mistakes that initially led to SIIHEN, WHAT WAS WITNESSED, JOS TAPAHTUI.
However, this time we will not shed our hatred and confidence in others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you're pictured as wrong," the works that our grandparents might have done or not to do.
You will also go too far as you say that they poured out their 'abuses and mistrusts to others'.
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about 'ours' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
"If we're completely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group of society can say that it has behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done was good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no more to talk about – this is what we agree on.
And just as it is unnecessary to share the charges, there is no need to make adjustments, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to make them.
But for what the past does exist if it doesn't get learned--
There's a past, so we can forget about it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist driving on the sidewalk, described by passers as "sudden and angry".
There's gonna be a lot of coincidences.
The Lesotho army denies planning an attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the Lesotho army have refused to stage the attack on the government and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and fired government buildings in Maseru.
The Head of State traveled with his family to a neighbouring country in South Africa after telling us that he has been sentenced to death.
Major Ntle Nto of the Army denied the attack and said that the army responded to this threat from "political fanatics". The police have been told that they have tried to arm the fanatics.
"Lesotho's defense forces took steps to obtain a number of intelligence that some police forces are trying to arm young party fans while they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America News Office.
According to the President of the Government of South Africa, the military action looked like a revolution.
"While no entity has claimed to have repealed the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho's military forces seem to be signs of the respective revolution enterprise," he says.
According to Lesotho military officials, soldiers return to their camps on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothethjoa Metsing will lead the government while Thabane is away.
Thabane says he believes that action is being taken because he has tried to fight corruption.
Lesotho has been showing tension since June when Thabane interrupted Parliament's meetings due to the differences between the great coalition government.
He denies such a reduction in government power, even though it is claimed.
Trade magazine: Microsoft set up a data center for Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data center for Uusimaa, where the location of the company does not agree to be specified.
In a newsletter sent to Microsoft media, the company notes that it does not tell the location of all its data centres for safety reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment for Microsoft for hundreds of millions of dollars.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been abducted.
Microsoft will completely cease his office in Oulu, which will take about 500 people to work.
In all, Microsoft has announced that it will make up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft's Communication Manager Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how many staff the new data center employs.
The creation of a data center in New Zealand was reported on Monday in the Chamber of Commerce.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video under water, you have several different equipment options to choose from.
The most advantageous option is the watertight compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about 300 dollars.
I myself took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than 350 dollars.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed in a watertight way.
In addition, set camera description settings to match images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a regulation to optimise the description conditions under water.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure your device can go deep.
Some cameras only last 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet depth.
Check our shopping guide and digital cameras reviews for both normal and water-tight models.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
The compact cameras have LCD display, which allows you to fit the image, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see under water, and the image of the combing can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows for cutting, which means taking multiple images at one time by different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced by deeper light.
If possible, stay close to the surface while describing the pool, lake or sea.
This also gives you more colors; the deeper you go, the less you see colors.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important piece of advice when it comes to painting the land, but it is even more important under water because the light conditions are narrow.
It is very important when there is an action camera: in these devices there is often a fixed lens with a wide angle of images, that is, the image time must be close to the target in order to meet the entire frame of the image.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates despite the growing unrest which required democratic reform in 2017 for elections.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong on the basis of activists' start to plan and implement demonstrations only for hours after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the People's Congress of China to give the Communists the power to push away all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was supposed to be, but it's still horrid," says the president of the democratic party, the legislator, Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to Hong Kong.
It's obvious that we're working with an independent regime.
Vice-President Li Fei of the Committee of the People's Congress of China defended the Chinese administration, saying that the general candidate in the election of Hong Kong's leader would be too 'sabot'.
Since 1997 the United Kingdom, giving Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised its inhabitants that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017.
According to the Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wishes to strictly control the electoral process through the appointment committee, which is managed in Beijing.
According to the new sentence, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
During the summer preceding the decision, some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
Behind the campaign to defend democracy was largely the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which organisers have threatened to prevent the operation of the business block if Beijing does not give Hong Kong genuine public voting rights.
On Sunday night, just hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters met in front of the Hong Kong headquarters.
In a demonstration, the organisers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of citizenship and would bring about protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not explain the details, obviously afraid that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
When they announced on the network, the organisers said that the movement "to consider the Occupy Central campaign as the last means to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry when we announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been abandoned and that the take-up of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday the security measures were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest feeds on many feeling that residents are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave from the mainland has caused competition in products and services.
Furthermore, there is fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, will disappear under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s living conditions — the business world.
"The protest they speak of can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it will take" says the legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We don't want Hong Kong to slip away.
Such a image would be bad for investing.
The media of the Chinese state also contains stories that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the midgets of the Western powers of the revolution".
This summer, the activists held a referendum on informal voting rights involving 780 000 people — over a fifth of Hong Kong voters.

The United States’ prom tradition attacks UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to respond to the demand by setting up the first British luxury travel form for students today.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure that the customer reaches the university as soon as possible.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect in the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property through the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are prepared to offer today's students the easiest and highest quality of transportation to the university.
According to the company’s representative, no reservations have yet been received since the service was set up, but added that “students start making orders in the next few weeks”.
The company believes that there is demand for the service, even though most students pay 9 000 pounds per year.
Today’s students are very different from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago from the perspective of their expectations and hopes. Now it is more important than ever to create an ancient first impression, and the VIF is exactly the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organisation is critical of a service that is not realistic.
Megan, Vice-President of the University College, says: "This service plan seems to be really far away from the life of the senior student".
Many of their studies will start to upset the level of living costs when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been lost since the huge increase in basic living costs, which will only begin to wonder where thousands will be available for use in both simple matters and campuses.

basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had passed out on the field
The basketball Sasu Salin was the body of the victory of Finland today.
He was able to forget the heart of his US match and turned the bloods of the second half of Ukraine into a standing solution.
But Sali moved all the glory to the wolves and did it in style:
I was going to pass out there at the end of the field. That encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, it was my fog, there was nothing.
The noise and the white public sea were almost too much for me.
The power times of the hall were kept inside nine surfaces at a rapid pace, with ball stripes, discs, and stamping everywhere.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flat state like that, so it all worked out.
They're coming from somewhere, somewhere, right now, in a very, very, very important place, Sasu was glowing.
It's my role.
Do all that.
Now it's great to see others caught up with it.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team of fans and spirit creatures, so it is no wonder that his example brought the whole team into a flight that was too much for the big and tough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of break: The previous ones were remembered by a gross judge game
Heikki Montonen (oik.) bearing Kassi was the main coach of Finland during the World Cup in Argentina in 1982.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team played the last time in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of Finland and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament than yesterday: it was a hot fight against France in the early part.
"In that match, the court game was a wasteful game," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already set in the back line.
All of a sudden, the game was continued.
We lost it in 2-3, and after that, the shit went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played head coach Heikki Montose in command and finally settled into 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's elections, when the MM tournament in Poland gets on the ground this Saturday.
A lot of things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same as before, but quality and skill are now more.
The averages of players have also grown.
The game is even faster," think about Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be divided.
I expect Finland to proceed from the baseline.
Then it could be tight," says Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victory fight against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the MM tournament.
Let's hope it's time for the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go nuts," said Parkkali.
Lajlegenda Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö were sailing in Tunisia.

Finnishmen saved Cita Dog Mountains from Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Norwegian Merthe Mikkelsen and his dogs got into trouble on Thursdays in the mountains, Antti and Tuumo Soini were bravely offered help.
The weekend Mikkelnen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his assistants once more.
Mikkelsen reported in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog who had been with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his money.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep landscape.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and draw it a little forward, but its feet did not only carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no police officers, no nearby hotels, no passers.
In the dark of the evening, the situation already seems to be threatening.
Fortunately there were two walkers who were ready to help: the tamperian Antti Soini and his father, Tumo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway in Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in comparison to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanom in his message.
Soon there was also a German man who had a traveler with him.
Patja Citadel was given a couple of types to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came up for a moment after us, considering what to do with the dog and carrying the dog down the front for a moment, soni says.
KUVA: Tuoma Soini
The dog was allowed to be boarded with a traveler.
According to Soini, performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry in a difficult terrain.
However, about one and a half hours later, Cita was happily brought down.
After the event Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank them again.
So they answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unreached.
I don't know what I would've done without these heroes, Mikkelsen's happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we probably wouldn't have returned.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
On the other night, I was on my way home.
They had received joyous hearings from Mikkelsen.

The genetic deviation is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman was afraid of dying because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth was that he only had a few years left to live because he had a diagnosis of another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease (CMT). It means a series of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as there is so little knowledge of them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMTs, which cause symptoms of motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking, and toes.
The disease can also cause insensitivity or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
While Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA) with a very poor percentage of survival.
Rodgers believed that they would go to a wheelchair before they would complete 18 and die before reaching the age of 30.
Today, 51-year-old mother of two children says, "When I was a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer than anyone else.
I could never roll or roll with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
While Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several minor surgery to perform his legs. In the event of surgery, after leaving his room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but after coming home with accurate medical information in the library and writing to the FA association," he says.
When I found out about them, I was shocked and in a panicous state.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by 18 years and die before I filled 25, and in the meantime, I'd lose my full ability.
I went through this for myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by 17 years old, he concluded that his walk was not as bad as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor was just hugging me and saying, "Dear girl, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering a much less from a dangerous illness.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what CMT disease was, I thought I was postponed," he says.
Charity CMT UK order CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

The Russian space test failed - the gays sent to the sex trip died
Five small gigs sent to Russia's space are dead, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation's space organization.

Koconen: We have good chances of winning
The wishes of the basketball team on the way forward are in the game when Finland meets today in his second match with the World Cup in Ukraine.
If the opening ceremony was expected for the United States, Ukraine will be among the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have good chances of winning, Petter Kolonen foresight.
On Saturday, in his first match, Ukraine hit the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team coachs the NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion three years ago.
Jeter threw 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter's quick guy, but we're played against those before, and we need to get our normal defense back, Koconen said.
Hanno Mötölta promised that Finland would play better than last night in its defeat to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal wolf pack on the field, Mötölä said.
The alleged infections of the Hollywood stars spread online - part of the guaranteed real
There are a number of naked photos spread over the Internet, which are said to present well-known public figures.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of the "breeding campaign".
The websiteTMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a dirty violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted and representatives are threatened.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread over her are real.
She had taken those photos years ago with her husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the harsh pain they saw for this.
I feel sorry for all those who were victims of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice says pictures that go wrong in his own name.
Real or fake naked photos are also on the move from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Dutch painter criticized his own: "Don't work hard enough to get out of here"
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Ripper.
The layman Walter Recent comments after Sunday's VPS match are a very confusing picture of the current situation of the company.
I haven't had a goal coach in four months.
But everything has to adjust," Vitala said after a 12-step struggle.
In the fight, Honka made a lot of defense mistakes, especially in the first half of the year.
Paintkeeper Viitala wasn't feeling bad about fighting defenses.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and therefore also defenders in front of Viikano have shifted at a certain pace.
Also with the player bill, many young players have gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Oh, you don't work hard enough to get out of here sometimes," The Vitala went bad and didn't name any single player.
Honga's chief coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Viitaly.
"After the game, I told certain players that if you came to exercise and games to have fun and you think you're a knife player, and you don't have to work, so you're probably wrong with the team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids a playtime.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also recalled that players cannot expect immediate success when players are constantly changing.
This season has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially at the head of defense, the crowd has changed.
That is the biggest reason why we are in this place," Kuqi said.
After VPS, Honka is a serial jumbo with the second last TPS at the same points.
There are still seven rounds left, so the Espans still have time to avoid falling into One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We're really not gonna drop out of this show," goalkeeper Viatala threatened.

This is what Sakar Pehkone, the basketball player, said when Finland had played in the EM final tournament against France at the Athens Marouss Balloon.
He didn't overdo it.
I remember the game when you were there.
So there were also about one hundred Finns who called for 20 000 viewers, otherwise the noise of an empty regime.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the World Cup Finland-Ukrainian match?
In Bilbao, hundreds of Finnish fans are eighty-fold.
The EM contests in 1995 were the time for Finnish basketball.
Men cut off their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, Russia's fur fight at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory would open the doors to Europe's cream.
It all looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttelu.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann brought Mötö to the rest of the tournament team.
The solution that many disagreed on.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far from wise, even though everything did not go according to the manuscript.
After Athens, the basketball country team dived deep.
In Athens’s competitions, Finns were known to be around a little over 100.
It includes journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaching and some fans.
There are journalists, relatives and trainers in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to an inexplicable proportion.
I'm sure no one can say the exact figure of Finnish tourists.
They've been moving between 7 500 to 10,000.
There was a chapter there, whatever it was, it's a completely incomprehensible number.
This is an explanation for sports sociology.
In the global economy, businesses move across borders.
There is still a chance in sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go see how our girls and boys succeed in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkonen of motion.
There will certainly be Finns in both Spain and the World Cup in Poland who are applying for an experience.
Joint experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
There's got to be a lot of attraction in sports, too.
Itkonen will raise sport into a popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to Berlin to watch art.
But without success, you can't move the masses.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball Union and the players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It was almost ten years ago.
Then the direction changed and the ground team activity was lifted up on foot.
The plane crew did the same thing a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Ikkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports, where the sacred Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
Then there's an interest in the audience.
And the media has taught me what this charismatic support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can balling species move this massive interest also to home series?
In basketball and volleyball, the average play is for hundreds or a little more than a thousand viewers.
It is not necessary to give an answer to the question that would make a very good promise to the species.
Another school believes interest will move.
The other is the one that doesn't want to taste the stomach full.
This crowd is ready for their trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking the national series are not of double interest.
It's a challenge for the followers in the middle of a scream.
To the Bottak - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola rewards the shape driver on Valtter Bottaktan's beach home.
At its meeting on Monday, the Government unanimously approved the release of a plot of 1.4 hectares.
In the future, there will be a leisure apartment.
The success of Bottak has been monitored in Nastola since this surveying period.
He's being tried as a good ambassador to market Lahtea, the Lahti Region and Nastola.
The pool is located in Koiskala, on the shores of Kärkjärve.
It has become owned by Nastola municipality as part of a larger real estate store.
There are seven buildings in the area, of which the municipality will decommission six by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved his fourth prize ball this year in the Belgian competition 1.
He's at World Cup 5th.
Bottas is a native nastolian and has lived with his childhood on Vil source.
He lives in England today, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free from formula.
Bottas has visited upper secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design clothes come, but I don't think they're poor.
It is presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
The testers of Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are the field's ball people, but also the amateur Marcus Giron, who is one of the top players at the university.
According to him, shirt helps him to monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver ants, from which the information is transmitted to the bulwark in the shirt, and from there on the smartphone or the chart computer, have been boned.
Sensors measure heart rate, breath rhythms, stress, and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the battery operating as a central unit shall be removed.
The fashion house has not given us an exact time to start selling the shirt, nor has it even suggested its price, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that's involved in smart clothes.
Californian Athos has sold the smart shirt and the smart ones.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece and the central unit of the thumb size they're demanding costs two hundred dollars.
Tekno clothes were also written by Red Orbit.
Smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America is $1,000 for many students, so soon the beginning of their second year of study Matt Schroeder invented a clever way to save costs.
He developed a system where students of later annual courses borrow their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books right away.
"My book of mathematics would normally have paid 180 dollars; I paid ten dollars for its use for the whole academic period as well as a tufty sandwich," says the 19-year-old Schroeder studying in Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder tells me that his books last semester would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University’s Board of Directors, more than $1,200 students spend a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways of reducing these costs.
Students are increasingly determined to use online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, when they can use the book throughout the academic period and pay clearly less for it than the students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, the book rental of more than 250 campuses has doubled since 2011.
Statistical data on the sector reveal that about one quarter of the books of university bookstores last spring had rental books, says Trevor Meyer, Chairman of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here's the simplest way to save money.
Net sales
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay in a campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is worth nearly $290, but in the online shop of special books, Chegg.com is paid $239.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn out appearances.
For example, the Calculus book can be used in the Chegg.com online store for 93,49 dollars.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years, explains that he bought the book "Strategic Media Declarations: Understanting The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used by Amazon.com for just 0.42 dollars.
A new book would have paid $48.
Ingrid Bracey and other academics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls are recommending that students ask their professors whether previous weights can be used on the course.
Sometimes reforming new weight is not essential for teaching.
In this case, old printing can only be found on a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon book stores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to purchase used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting books if you take good care of them, remember to return them, and do not need them when you complete the course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of your new book.
For example, renting the Calculus book for the whole academic period costs about $20.
Please refer to the rules of the renting company, such as notes, the use of the raising pen and the subsequent payments.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be bigger than the purchase price of the book.
E-mails
The acquisition of e-books instead of ordinary papers may also be a question.
These books are sometimes rented to its holder, such as Amazon, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store will receive the Calculus e-mail for six months for approximately 61 dollars.
Bracey says that many students of literature save the most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, whereas books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It's worth comparing between the different sellers, which is the choice.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdine in legal science, recommends using a good book ISBN number to determine the price, as it can make sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering from the network, make sure the book is in storage, Gault says.
He himself learned this through the heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was in the ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to purchase the book at full cost in the university bookstore.
Tampere Legion Theatre completes 20 years
The theatre, set up in 1994, is opposed to unemployment, exclusion and passiveity.
All those who want to perform art are welcome for their activities.
Set up exercise activities for long-term unemployed between 17 and 35 years of age.
These proposals often take the view of society.
In recent years there is depression-related Depression Moderata, Minamäminä! - humorous reports of narcissism and classic affections.
He believes that every person can change his or her own life.
Almost double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year.
In the fires this year, nearly twice as many people have died compared to last year.
According to Finland’s Central Rescue Organization (Spek) media monitoring, 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, men have been.
There have been 11 over 65 years of age.
According to the organization's fire statistics, the worst situation was in 2009, when 64 people were killed in the fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in the floors, 21 in the homes, and seven in the rows and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the home's repeated fire safety.
At least according to Spec, the effectiveness of all home fire alarms should be ensured.
In addition, everyone should check that initial extinguishing devices are easily accessible.
There must also be an accessible exit route from all the premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use when home alone.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protest in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered together in the city centre of Newport on the march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at a meeting in the city hall in Cardiff.
Stephen Fairclough followed events during the weekend and spoke with protestors, who had arrived even since Belgium.
Young people were rescued by flight from the Australian Blue Mountains
One teenager was raised safe after the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man left for a walk on Sunday after noon to Govets Leap in Blackheadh.
The relatives were concerned about young people who had not returned home, and they called the police from midnight.
A search team composed of local police and assistants was sent to find young people, and the twins were found near 23 o'clock in Bridal Veil.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The cops spent the night with a couple, and they were brought up to safety on Monday morning.
The pathogens were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital with an ambulance, and they were stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
Ukraine's troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have been very keen to get together with Russian tanks on the field.
According to the army's representative, the defendant's cannonfire has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the last 24 days, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
On the coast of Asovan, the Ukrainian patrol ship, which received a strike from south-eastern Ukraine yesterday, was sunk in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight marines have been saved and two are still missing.
The Border Guard had no guarantee of where the ship was shot.
Separatists told me yesterday that they shot a ship on social media.
According to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian troops should immediately withdraw to positions that they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, today in Minsk's negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and OSCE, an immediate ceasefire should be created without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia should respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First of all, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from our partners' actions, Lavrov threatened.
The rains became flooded by Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets were flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday, when heavy rainfalls dangled south Sweden and Denmark.
The flood water cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that it may take some time to reduce the flood, even though rain was predicted to cease to rain.
Hard rains came to the surprise of the Swedish authorities, and the rains were not given in advance by the weather.
The friend of the Finnish Air Science Institute, meteorologist Ari Mustala, estimates that the area affected the rainerinmat was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and we're standing still.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should "sometimes quiet and help France", Francois Hollande's main supporters say.
Valls urged a deeply divided left-wing "to show his feelings" towards a Socialist president with difficulties, which, with the composition of the new government, was not approved by the French majority.
The President deserves all due respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to stay close to him," Valls said and earned the applause.
As an elusive gesture, the Prime Minister called on the Government to leave peace despite the 35 hour working week of the French controversial minister Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs, on a proposal that raised the debate, so that the rule should be broken down.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira caused a difference in the appearance of the socio-occupationalists who expressed different views and criticised the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope of the future'.
Marine Le Pen, head of the National Front of the Great Court, mocked the continued separation between the Socialists and said that he did not believe that the new government of Valls would last a few months further.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not even last for the summer.
"And the new government can take until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal to dispel the Parliament and made sure that his party's election win in early elections and that he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French governing party suffered a break-off in March’s municipal halls, and the extremists held a list point in May in the EU elections.
According to the Opinion of the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76 per cent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break into a number of competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new Socialist Government could improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka cheated on the head of Finnish drunkards Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda in the recorded part of the program.
Last Thursday, the Finnish programme published a fun video of recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page.
With video drunkers Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the next day's broadcast of the Finnish Advertising Puff, but the recording does not go right into the tube.
Alm-Sira is confused in her words when she tries to say a word about the budget line, and her confusion also gets Pouda and Rahkola to lose a poker once after a while.
And these heroes should be allowed to draw a direct broadcast tomorrow, says the Facebook update of the morning.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and distributed on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, worked at the press photo office, was placed in the third series of potretists in 1972.
The image is the Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir.
At the Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki, the building of the architects was attended by a meeting of the Socialist International in May 1971.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven guards went in.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to record.
I took this picture four feet from here.
The light and the background were right.
I just realized I did it this time.
The image of the Master shows that the leaders of the Middle East have been having trouble before.
At that time, the competition was good with pictures of known persons or events.
It is wonderful that you can succeed in other images today, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best shot is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Olympics in Munich.
That's what I didn't send to the competition.
Reference: Aarnio has already paid over EUR 5 million
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the City of Helsinki Narcotics Department has already cost more than EUR 5 million and has required 30-50 staff years.
This is how Jyr Rajamäki Jyväskylä evaluated the University in hissis on computer technology.
The border station proposes that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime at all could be significantly improved by combining IT systems in investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to the border, today's technology allows multiple use of criminal technology material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where the information collected to detect the offence is automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain, while at the same time allowing comprehensive law enforcement.
The claim will be checked Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Food and chicken dishes included in fish and chicken dishes"
A picture of the special information on the school of women’s travel on the wall of the school caused a meal in social media, says Yle’s website.
A plant eater!
Fish and chicken dishes included in the school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetable choice!
This is observed in the school’s forgotten, 15 - year - old newsletter.
I'll let you look at the picture from here.
The image of social media has led people to send to Pirkkala’s native population an intimidated feedback.
The head of the food and cleaning service, Arja Vaarma, notes to Yle that the lost note on the wall was not true and should have been removed from time ago.
Apparently, before I come, there has sometimes been an idea that has been discussed with healthcare in due course.
Every student gets a meal that he wishes, he says to Yle.
This day, students at schools in Pirkkala will be offered a plant-food option only with parents’ permission and a doctor’s certificate or nurse’s certificate for the choice of vegetable food.
The charm is based on Yle’s decision to leave young people’s vegetable food trials under nutrition, and the absence of meat or chicken can be a source of wonders from the pupils’ parents.
Norwegian Cruise, worth close to $3 billion Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, negotiate to buy its competitors Prestige Cruises International Inc with three billion dollars.
With the sale of Norwegian Cruise with a market value of $ 6.8 billion, Prestige Cruises would have to be used by luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as they continue to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RRL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on a possible agreement may already be published this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not produce that result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private venture capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names in public because there was no public consultation.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company from Miami has 13 cruise ships covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when net sales amounted to USD 2,57 billion.
The Prestige Cruises, which operates from Miami, sails on Oceania and Regent brand names, including eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was 1.2 billion dollars, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies compete to become the first option of these new customers when they choose cruises.
Prestige Cruises register its first issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares since trade in 2007, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its combined Genting Bhd (GENT.KL). The latter is the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested billions of dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting’s share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo was 20 per cent and the private equity investment company’s share of TPG Capital LP was 8 per cent from the end of June.
The calculated share of North America’s cruise capacity by Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies is 82%, as shown in the registration document published in connection with the launch of Prestige Cruise’s shares.
The City Government of Tampere is dealing with this today.
Animalia hopes that the city administration will support a firm initiative.
According to Salla Tuumivaara, the managing director of Animalia, the University of Tampere, who prepares thesis, during the dolphins in Finland and around the world, should be terminated quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, it has become a general view that the presence of developed mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither safe nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be expected to take place in Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinarium is not only a question of animal law, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, the Court of Justice points out.
According to the case-law, the death of Näsi-Dlphin confirms the requirements of the lowering of dolphin activity.
I saw death as a sad continuation to the dark history of Särkänniemi delfinarium.
It is time to put a point to the dead, close the dolphins' prison and begin to find out how to move the dolphins in Tampere to a limited sea area, in a kind of dolphin shelter, the Court demands.
You didn't have time to experience the return of dolphins to the original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Särkänniemi will be able to experience even more lives than their unruly concrete.
The Animal Protection Union for Animal Health is aimed at prohibiting the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the overall reform of the animal protection law under preparation.
These are also dolphins.
In support of this request, the Managing Director of Animalia will take part in today's 1.9th demonstration on behalf of the dolphins.
The statement of mind held at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are imprisoned or killed per year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with eastern Ukraine on the new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the 'national' region, the Russian news sources tell.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the region of eastern Ukraine controlled by the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be re-examined in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their rights and interests.
Putin's demand for negotiations with the Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners reflects his manifest strategy, which he has followed five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists to take over the region and thereby force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly declared Novorossian independence to be its leader instead of Russia's West.
In an interview with Kanava 1 TV, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to reinstate the eastern region of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by the separatists, which was occupied by the separatists on March 18th following the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula in March and April.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently baptized the region into "Novorossy", "New Russia" – this term reminds us of the days of the spell that preceded the revolutions of the Russian power.
According to the Russian News Office Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations will be a 'flammation' as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October, and government forces attack civilians in areas controlled by the separatists.
"We need to enter into extensive negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and state status of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "nationalism" is linked to a broader independence, which has been discussed with Kiova's leadership for months in its attempt to eliminate the fears of Russian-speaking regions for their cultural and linguistic rights to be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
There cannot be discussions on this matter between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, 'because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine'.
The interim statement by the representative of the Kremlin, which was intended to correct Putin's 's false interpretation', stressed that the Russian regime deals with the separatists of eastern regions in a different way than in the case of Crimea, which in practice is dominated by the region, whose majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to connect to even the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, since the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are ethnically Russian and, according to the opinion polls before the conflict, the majority of the population was in favour of keeping in Ukraine.
The independence of the Russian diplomats in international forums would allow the local authorities in Ukraine to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which in practice would give the Kremlin power in the area of unity which combines Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was connected to Russia five months ago, is located in the main Russian fleet as well as in commercial maritime ports and historic coastal destinations.
There are also mines, factories and metal alloy plants in the area between Rostovin and Crimea, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, President of Ukraine, Mr Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions which are outside the core region of Ukraine from their own economy and the role of languages.
His vision of independence, however, appears to differ sharply from the view of the Graml and Moscow armed and Lithuanian separatists.
Putin made its most recent demand to the Government of Kiev for negotiations with the Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after last week the rebels moved further to Russia's tanks and troops from the former peaceful region of eastern Ukraine on the coast of Azov.
Ukraine's security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovsk, supported by Russia's separatists, will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategic coastal area until Crimea.
It has led to a massive increase in the size of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Half a million inhabitants are known as a steel-producing port city located between the narrow land leading to Novoazovsk and the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union, in Brussels, asking for further measures to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, in the former Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point that will not be returned," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any decisions on direct action; leaders presented additional sanctions to introduce them if the Ukrainian crisis is re-examined under unclear conditions.
Ukraine's soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaki region after two Russian tanks and 1 000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk area last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 soldiers in Russia’s Ilovisk were replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening painting made the Japanese-man Pussy Honda in the seventh game minutes.
During the second half, Sulley Muntar first hit him and, a little later, Jeremy Menez's penalty shot.
Laziokin received a punisher at the end of the game, but the goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shooting.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
Milan's former attack icon in Inzagh coachy was only half the San Siron stadium.
39 000 viewers were announced as the number of audiences in the match.
Australian posters and Gabi Grecko in the round of the screenshot scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he's been confounded by hackers perhaps stealing his fiancée and Hollywood's A-list Gabi Grecko's naked photos.
In the entertainment world, a number of Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures have been published on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging film search scandal.
The hacker has been told to hold a total of 60 naked pictures of the Nightingale Lawrence as well as other superstars, such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingagnet, the singer from Rihana, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actor from Kirsten Dunst.
Also, the images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsk and Grecko in Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
The list has 101 famous names.
In the last month of Grecko, Edelsten said to the Confidential magazine, "this is disgusting".
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and distributed.
In the New York City, Greckon, with comments, reports a case in the online newspaper, "a disgraceful" and said that the victims "feel ashamed of themselves".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer on the upper part of the pool.
Palmer's films include Love and Honor's opponent Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahovski and the Sucker Punch actor Browning didn't comment on the hacked pictures last night.
The representative of Lawrence said to the TMZ magazine that "this is a blatant violation of privacy".
The actor Seth Rogen got angry at the hacker in his Twitter: "The publication of stolen images is in no way different from the sale of the stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be possible, even from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like its home country and won a sensational victory from Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fanhuum.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red-white but Finnish blue-white.
According to the STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finns.
I felt like I was playing on the field.
The fans had such a big influence on our game, the Finnish captain Antti Siltala said to the STT.
Finland had already lost 0-2 but won 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle up behind six points.
