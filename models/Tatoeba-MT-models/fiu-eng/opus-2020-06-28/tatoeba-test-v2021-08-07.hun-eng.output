I remembered her duty.
I respect Tom.
I'll retire in four years.
I put my ass at risk for you.
First pick up these shirts.
I'll run faster than you.
I run five miles a day.
I'm running.
I've raised the horses, sir.
That's what I said, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wasn't gonna work!
I said no.
Thank you.
I was sitting and staring.
I'm sitting next to him.
I've been sitting here thinking.
I've been sitting here thinking.
I was sitting next to the driver.
Tomato fruit or vegetables?
I was sitting on the ground.

I saw him take a bear truck.
Last weekend, I saw a really good movie.

I saw something.
I saw it.
I saw the car explode.
I saw them.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
I saw Thomas today.
I saw your name on the list.
I snuck out the sink.
I secretly hoped this would happen.
I took a photo of him.
I secretly photographed him.
I see a house.
I see a lion.
I see a nobleman and a noble woman.
I don't see it very often.
I can see that.
I understand what you're thinking.
I've simulated a threat.
I sent you flowers.
I served with Tom at the special forces.
I put the table for six people.
I put it on six.
Is everyone okay?
Is everybody here?
— Everyone talking about me? — No, Tomi. You are not so important.
Everything's fine in the office.
Is everything ready?
Is fast food really unhealthy?
Harder French than English?
Is it difficult to pronounce French?
Do you teach French in your school?
Your tongue is French?
Is it a crime to strangle Youtube?
Is he sick or is he a doctor?
American?
Are you crying?
Is this my friend?
Is he tall?
I shook my hand with Tom, and I went.
I got my head shaked.
I should probably go there.
I should have asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been more sophisticated.
I should have been more precise.
I should have been more thorough.
I should have been there sooner.
I should have brought more food.
I should've come here first.
I should have done that last week.
I should have done this somewhere else.
I should have done that with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I never should have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have denied doing that.
I should have seen this coming.
I should have stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should have expected that.
I should have followed your advice.
I should have said I was busy.
I'm screaming, but no one can hear me.
I just want to know what this is about.
Is that a bird?
Is it okay if I call you Tom?
Is that a wolf?
Is it cold in Germany?
Is that dangerous?
It's easy to learn to speak esperantly?
Is he fatal?
Will it fall tomorrow?
Is it hard to speak English?
Is that mandatory?
Is that normal?
Do you mind if I sit here?
A rainer?
Is it too late?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Is it true Tom killed himself?
Is it true that you've been studying in a week?
Is it true that you've been involved with Tomi's daughter's request?
Is it true you like salty coffee?
Time's hot?
More affordable with fruit than coffee?
I'll ski in the winter. I'll swim in the summer.
Laurie dung?
I sleep with two pillows.
I slept for an hour after midnight last night.
I fell asleep, I was late for school.
I slept for nine hours.
I've been talking to my boss.
I've cut the turkey.
Mary Tom's mother?
Cigarettes.
Monday's gonna be okay?
Do I understand?
I just clicked a picture.
I slipped into the house.
I ran into the house.
I sneeze.
Is that okay?
Didn't you have enough to ruin my life?
Isn't that a stomach flutter?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Is Paris far?
I'll talk to you in Dutch.
I'll talk a little in Hungarian.
I speak a little in Hungarian.
I talk a little in Hungarian.
I'll talk a little Russian.
I'll talk a little Russian.
I'm a little Russian.
I speak French almost every day.
I speak French and English.
I'm speaking Spanish.
I've been with him all day.
I've been with them all day.
I spent all my money.
I spent all my money.
I spent all the money I had to buy the book.
I was walking for an hour until I realized where to go.
I spent my life in Incubator.
I've spent my life in Incubator.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I spent the whole day talking to him before my plane.
I spent three years in prison for a crime I didn't commit.
I spent three years sitting here for something I didn't do.
I told you so early.
They're going to get a lemon jam on my bread.
Is it rainy?
Russia's Europe or part of Asia?
Is he so important?
Is this your mom?
Is she really close to Malta?
I've been staring at papers all day, and now I'm tired.
I began to doubt his claim in the truth.
I stayed.
Tea is more expensive than milk?
Do you have permission?
Is that all your change?
Secret?
Is that right?
Is that deliberate?
Is that fly in the picture or is it photographed?
Is that fly in the picture or is it on it?
Is that my mug?
Is this a public document?
Is that a problem for you?
Is this real money?
Does he have a scientific basis for this?
You expected something like that?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is that the problem?
Right?
But is that true?
Is that what everyone wants?
The cat's in the chair or under it?
The beach's clean?
Is the competition so bad?
Is the microphone on?
Is the museum open today?
Is there a doctor on board?
Is there room for free?
Is there a subway in your city?

Is that valuable?
Is this home love for you?
You call that home love?
Is this your girlfriend?
Is this your money?
I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years ago, exactly where were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
There's one more or two things to put in your suitcase.
I have breakfast to do.
I still think it's the best choice.
Is Tom Christian?
Tom cooks well?
Tom's a good cook?

Tamás's left-handed?
Is Tom lost?
The son of Mary Tom?
Is Tom ready?
Thomas is still sick?
I was standing by.
I came to see you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I'm studying for about two hours every day.
I'm studying hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're packed and ready to go.
I'm sure I've heard that sound somewhere.
I swear I'll make up for it.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Are you feeling better about your daughter?
You're doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over.
I'll take his place.
I go on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It's out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
This goes with the love I feel for you.
He's cost a lot more than I expected.
This is the price of two euros.
Could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all the work wasted.
He's obviously freaking me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow hasn't stopped.
I'm sure he'll let you come.
He's not doing anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it's been poured into me.
I soon realized I misunderstood her.
It's been snowing the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
That was exactly the day of our marriage, honey.
There had to be some reason for this.
It happened all of a sudden.
That's what happened when he was outside.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
I've got your own value.
It's been raining since you were a kid.
I think all fat people should be dieting.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll have a good time with your neighbors.
I find her novel boring.
I think he's lost a few movies.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill him.
I don't think I can kill him.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think we have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
I thought I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
It's a very small probability, I think, that you're going to be able to do it yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think it's true.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll have a good time with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I don't think something's right.
I'll find the spiders for the candy.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about this.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think it makes any sense that we're trying to convince him.
I think you guys did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was already there.
I think Tomi's exciting.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Thomas wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we should be patient.
I think we're in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all just being slobbered.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know the name of Thomas's girlfriend.
I think you're gonna make it up to me.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you got it wrong.
I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you're doing a great job.
I think you have a nice smell.
I feel like you weren't very convincing.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went somewhere to eat, it would cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought I was gonna blow my head off.
I've considered my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the leg, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought it was you.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
It hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under his influence.
I was very impressed.
This is dangerous!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to get into the practice we were talking about.
It's hard for everyone to like.
It's hard for everyone to please.
I have doubts about whether it will work.
It's getting very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every way possible.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
Wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector cannot be turned off.
It's not the best solution.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It doesn't fit to talk with mouth.
It's snowing.
Still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
Son of a bitch!
It's 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him to do.
It's on you.
It's useful information.
There's a lot of heat at night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you replace the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's going to be dangerous.
It'll be dark by the time we get home.
It'll be ready by the time it takes.
He'll be ready by the time he needs it.
It'll take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He's gonna knock you off soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
So it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need to be here.
I could use a shaving.
Looks like you're not feeling well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
That could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This can save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
I might be late.
You need to wash it.
You have to report something.
I'm sure it was love.
They must have stolen it.
You have to fix it.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.
Even though I lied to him, I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I can.
I told him to come.
I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question, too.
I bathed for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I was on my way 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I completely forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
The rain broke yesterday morning.
It fell yesterday.
It hurts a lot.
I'm working two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I went across and across the United States.
It actually works.
It's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'll try to get my thoughts together.
It's a nice flag.
Great cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, on paper.
A gray stone building.
It's a housekeeper dog.
It's half an hour until lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's totally dark out there.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's nice and good theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's seven o'clock.
It's already in progress.
It's 10:00 a.m. already.
One of my dreams was always living next to a stream.
It's always the same thing.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, a dirty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big weirdo.
It's a nightmare.
It's cold.
It's as art as much as science.
It's from the past.
He's at school.
Very dangerous sport, where a small mistake can cause serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
It's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing journey.
It's a tired day.
It's a tough day.
That's what happened earlier.
It wasn't any week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's a good night to sit down in the garden.
Firestorm.
Sky.
To get on a cheaper bus.
That's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
It's closed every Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed Sunday.
It's cold home.
It's cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
He knew the bear liked honey.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
That's totally normal.
It's okay.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's delicious.
It's ready.
It won't be any easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from far away.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
Looks like the bus was late.
That sounds ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks really weird.
Looks like it.
He seems to be lying.
Looks like Tom's in no hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
Looks to me like you're honest.
You seem wrong to me.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Dear.
It's fair to get the same salary for the same job.
It's not perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, that's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's becoming a commotion.
We're gonna have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
It's lucky to see a dead star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good to learn.
It's great you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard to reach that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that the whole time has been clean and day-to-day.
It's hard to write down.
It's hard to find a bench in this town, where you can sleep.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to say in words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's extremely nice.
He's got a lot on his head.
He's tall.
The kids are already in bed.
Stop talking about money!
It's hotter than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
It's important.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when children grow up.
It's important that we help those who are in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
We need to drown in here.
Can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just move.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
Today's laundry.
It's like a submerged field, and turtles over them, and sharks, like flying creatures.
That's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic the way he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
He's not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
It's not going to happen.
You're not going to do anything to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It can't be negative.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth crying about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't testify.
It doesn't make sense to be in the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's definitely impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think they're peasants.
It's okay if you're gay.
“ Three months have passed, and Tomi has already said that France is talking in a liquid way. ” — And, on the top of the stupid sheer. — What peak? — Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's only three days.
The park's on the other side.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm pouring it out of juice.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
Quite convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these mizantrophoric theories is to measure the working class, to save imperialism from the responsibility of the blood wars that he has cast, and to believe in the core of the thought that endless wars are caused by the aggressive tendencies of man.
It's very urgent.
In my heart it rains.
There are few large gardens located in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big song.
It's Amott.
It's harmless to ask someone how much he earns.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they'll be leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
He's snowing here.
He's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to stay home.
Still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
It's the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
You have to answer that one more time.
It's time we took our tent tree.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
Time to fix the problem.
I should cut my hair off.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time we do something about it.
Tom has his birthday today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
That's expensive to me.
It's too hot for that now.
It's too late.
It's too late to worry about it.
It's typical autumn time.
It's a fucking cold.
It's ugly yellow and it's not consistent with anything, but at least they don't get hit in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It's unlikely anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you to go or not.
Very attractive.
Very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very confusing.
Very fun.
It's a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
That's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
That's your only chance.
In order to gain a good language, about 10,000 hours of learning are needed.
It has to be bold to succeed.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took almost three years to build my house.
He's got everyone on guard.
She took just an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It took me a long time to find him, but after all, he was able to find him.
I turned into a small alley.
I've had a shovel.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was a good party.
It was dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
That was a stupid idea.
That was a tragic accident.
It was really good food.
It was just a waste of time for all of us.
It was a terrible thing to do.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
He was a loser.
It was obviously very enjoyable.
We had a good time yesterday.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and it was a couple of times.
It was just a kiruccana.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost early.
It was shortly before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of the seemingly hopeless situations.
