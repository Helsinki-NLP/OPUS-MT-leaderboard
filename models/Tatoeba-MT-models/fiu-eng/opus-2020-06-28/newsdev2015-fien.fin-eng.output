Changes in business support practices - Region - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national business aid will be concentrated in four EC Centres from mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the South Savon Easy Centre is responsible for operations in Mikkeli.
According to the new Enterprise Aid Act, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Fund aid must no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is entirely new.
The subsidiaries of more than five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be large municipalities.
On the other hand, EU support can continue to be provided for investment that improves the economic conditions of the municipalities.
In Eastern Finland, the unit managing EU and national aid will have about 30 people.
At least for the time being, they all continue to work in their current offices.
For example, Kalevi Pölösen, Head of Structural Funds Unit of the Southern Savoy Centre, is employed in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now seeking in Ukraine
Russia acts consistently, even if it does not always appear so.
Director of the Earth Defence University Strategy Institute, Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by the conflicting Ukrainian news of the Monday morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
Another Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and declared that Russia did not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its paratrooper forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received confirmations (read more here).
Lavrov insisted that an immediate ceasefire should be created during the Minsk negotiations without conditions.
Russia denies its involvement and must immediately be brought to the conclusion of the negotiations so that they can gain a stable position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big picture: suddenly we have to negotiate, and specifically so that Russia gets its own grip on the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair externalises travel services to the Norwegian company, leaves people
Finnair begins to purchase passenger services as a subcontractor from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement first concerns Finnair Hong Kong and Singapore's routes, but it is intended to be extended later.
The appearance of two routes in Finland results in a total reduction of about 100 people's working years, which will first be carried out on holiday, the company reported when it announced.
Moreover, the work of some 80 Asian temporary workers will run out of work at the time of the exit of the routes.
Finnair already reported in June that it intends to externalise about 20 route travel services over the next two years.
Outsourcing was achieved when savings were not achieved with staff.
The goal is to start out next year in January-March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also be continued with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nervous back pain, or stroke, in those who work hard to work.
In the occupational health department survey, firemen were followed for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disorders to the shock tree is surprisingly strong, even though many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance of firemen, tested regularly, do not appear to be protective of pain, reports the doctor Sirpa Lusa in the Public Health Service.
Firemen work is irregular work, where shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health service, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you feel new reasons for water damage?
It is easy to destroy other homes.
Water damage Water damage is not always caused by leaking pipes or taps, is recalled by a management union expert.
We have been contacted when the infringement of the aquarium has caused water damage in the building company, that it is possible for the aquariums to be banned, says Marine Furuhjelm, lawyer of the host union.
Furuch reminds us that not only pipes and sewers are common causes of water damage, but also today more and more new machines such as ice-cream machines have caused floods in homes.
Many do not know that machines such as washing or washing machines should not be left on.
The water well must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, because otherwise pressure in the tube can lead to water leaks.
A person may be found to have been negligent if these obligations have been neglected, in which case the person is liable for the damage.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance may compensate for the damage, depending on the conditions and the circumstances of the insurance.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused reckless damage, the resident is liable.
If the resident has gone off to the shower on the floor roof, the failure can often be proved, as in these cases the water has usually flooded elsewhere and the serviceman comes into the apartment, where there is a dead resident.
The Furuhjem reports that two floor wells have been installed in many student apartments today due to the general growth of the floor wells.
Water pollution has also caused waterbeds, although no longer so much more than before when they were more popular.
Even the dog’s water bubble and the fall of the home wine container may become real water damage.
I also know the case where there were many cats in the apartment who had peed on the floor so that there were extensive damage, says Furuhjelm.
The principle of correction always goes in the same way if not otherwise specified in the company’s corporate order.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of the surface material and damage to the structure of the building company, as well as damage to other dwellings.
Water damage causes damage to other homes easily, because the structure of concrete absorbs water very easily.
According to Furuhäm, household battery leaks are particularly difficult because batteries are easily leaking into unscathed structures.
At present, water damage can cause widespread air heat pumps that produce condensation water.
Water should lead to a fixed sewer or a rainwater network and not just a container.
It is also the responsibility of the shareholders to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, and the lawyer advises.
It is recommended that, even if the rules of the house company do not require, for example, a fixed removal of a washing machine, the insurance may be subject to a condition that the compensation will not be received for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policy.
However, I consider the loose water drains from washing machines, for example, to be a high risk caused by many damage.
I recommend that the removals should always be derived firmly into the sewers.
Loss of snow and water by balcony
Control of washing machine, washing machine, etc., while on board.
The closure of water mines (the washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor well is visible twice a year.
It is recommended that you connect your removals firmly to the sewer.
Check the gloves and their possible leaks
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experiences in a comment?
FC Honka lost again and poured into a serial jumbo.
On Sunday night at Tapiola Sports Park, two of the weakest teams of the football Skilling League were meeting this minute.
In June, the last winner of the victory was FC Honka hosting seven games of victory in a tube sailed by the Vasaan Pallo Society.
VPS just took his previous victory against Honka in July.
On Sunday the encounter with the Espoolas team came to a good bath, as VPS returned to its winning position for a long time, reading 2-1.
Olli Huttunen, head coach of the Vasasians, complained before the game about the inefficiency of his team, but the confused Honka defense made it easier for the VPS to paint.
I'm afraid it's very nervous to do it.
We didn't get any longer attacks, we didn't get the ball," Huttune estimates his own performance.
In the first half of Honga's slippers, Milos Milovic, Kosta Manev, played with real uncertainty.
Both the Vasian goals were created as a result of the loose playing of the cups.
The opening painting of the match was only seen after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey directed the Sebastian Beachvall launch by a hunky Honka painter Walter Viiton.
It's a bad first half-time.
By the time the team was on the field, it did the opposite than it was agreed before the game," Shefki Kuqi manasi, head coach of Honga.
After the first explosion, the Espoolers got their game together and rolled the ball at the head of the attack.
Especially the middle field player Carlos Portela and the wingman Roni Porokara were eager to pick up the scene, but the last solutions were almost repeated.
The closest goal was Honga’s central fieldman, Jussi Vasara, but with a 20-metre shot going a little past the VPS.
VPS struck effectively against the use of the ankles of its attackers and Honga's confusing toppirar.
At about half an hour, the Spaniards made a 2-0 component when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart reached a two-way pass.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good game end during the opening season and created repeated situations on his left side.
Stewart's speed, however, seemed to be too much for the esbolic defense all the time.
"In the next half, if you lose, then you lose with honor," Kuqi said.
During the second period, an enchanted Honka applied for the mining industry.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third company succeeded.
The wingman Yerai Vilabo finished the goal from the center of the penalty zone.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to track the match.
The Espoois team has taken more and more risks, giving VPS the opportunity to attack the most dangerous.
Both Stewart and Morrissey were once able to get into the fists with Violin, but the homicidal protests of the Honka painting team kept their home team in the game.
At the end Honka was a little tired, and he didn't get any more medals in time.
With the kill, Honka lit the Veikkasliiga for the last time there were seven more matches left.
Paper: Putin threatened to take over Kiev in two weeks
The Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite loud in his phone conversation with the President of the EU Commission Jose Manuel Barroso, says the Italian La Repubblica newspaper.
Putin expressed his irritation at the European Union's plans to tighten the sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica will tell you what Putin said.
According to the paper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: it's not worth annoying Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave an interview on the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night at the Russian television channel number one.
Putin told us in the interview that he was fully involved in the conflict within Ukraine and that he urged the government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the shooting of civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't watch next door" if people are shot dead at close distance, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The acting work destroyed the family
The hard work of the Konkari actor and the theatre family grew up acknowledging how an actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actor Esko Roine will spend 70 years next Friday, but for him, I think it's a good thing to say that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to a year ago or two years or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to continue, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but he still works for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was a joke that there were not many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At the moment, Roine has a role to play in the Helsinki City Theatre How to make a success in business life, at the Theatre's Theatre of Tampere, and at the Kvartet of Tampere's Comedy Theatre.
Roine will also be seen in the coming Risto Räpääja film.
KUVA: Reijo Hietanen
The role of Roette didn't start with promise.
I didn't fit in school to be a tiger boy.
40-50 years later, the teacher said that I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't fall.
The choice of the male was clear, there was no choice.
It seemed close and dear.
I was so busy leaving school and volunteer in an army just to get to theatre school as soon as possible.
Roine has made about 200 theater roles and 300 TV shows a little depending on how to calculate.
If you count things like the angelsmanns, that every part of the TV series is their own show, then the TV thing is over 600.
I was in the New Day for three episodes a week.
In the other spring, I was killed when there was no time to do it.
Commitments for autumn 2016
Eila Eila, 83, Liisa, 76, are in full swing and will make the most of the great roles of the Tampere Labour Theatre at the time of the show.
My little brother's gonna be up on the sheets for years.
That's how it looks now, but you don't know about this age.
You always have to take a little reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
Calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
They've left a man behind for years, too.
Age's not coming alone.
The knees have been operated, the hip is blushing, and the arthritis bothers, but when you don't let it bother you too much, yes, these are on your head, Esko Roine says.
The TV audience, Roine, became familiar, among other things.
From Merirosvoradio and from a sketch where he and Antti Einie shared hundreds of bills.
It was Antti Einio, who divided the crops.
I was trying to make them sad, not crops.
In the Chinese series, Roine was a superstitious Lieutenant Rautakallio.
He became a favorite of Tampere police officers, at the station when he was a similar-minded lieutenant.
A cop stopped the car on the street, pulled the window open and shouted to me, "It's great!"
Working Group Successful
The theatres in Roevia's mind have been left to mind, for example.
The Helsinki City Theatre’s Producer and Master’s Class, the death of the Tampere Labour Theatre passenger and the long-term stay of Tampere Theatre.
Everything has to do with the fact that the performances have been popular.
It's not because of me. It's the team that's been successful.
The Rimanals have come, too.
Pekka Pupää's role in the film is one of those.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I'm gonna regret those roles, but the outcome isn't satisfying me or the viewers.
You can't choose your own job as an actor.
It's only been very nice of what's been told.
In addition to theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business life.
In the '80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
There was nothing about it when I tried to be the manager of Tampere Theatre, an actor, and then a restaurant leader.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it was clear that these must not be aligned in any way.
The typical thing is, when the show was over or in the meantime and I was able to figure out if I was going to put on a sauna, the restaurant came up with a call that there are your friends here who hope to see you after the show.
Memory for Birthday
On his birthday there will be memories from Esko Roine, the ghost writer Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
They've made some kind of engagement from the face-mower's memory.
In Zoom's time, when I was played, I was called a face-sniff.
They didn't know me by name.
The book has been written for years.
At times, Roine told me that there's no news bombs at all, because she hasn't done anything so rough, or if she is, she won't tell me.
I made a small initial statement in the book.
I'm saying that if someone expects to be exposed to scandalous scandalous or good gossip, it's worth not reading here.
Well, there's a lot to do with the profession, as an actor when he's a theater manager.
The publisher also thinks that there's a tournament there from an unscrupulous theater school.
It was a pretty normal student's life, but I guess a kid had to do all the tricks he looked at.
It wasn't as rough as when it was Turkey.
It was very different.
I don't know how much else I got from there, but I'm sure that when school's gone so far, it's not gonna get caught if it doesn't get better.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I went to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I got friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Härinen, and I got to work with them.
After all, there were legends from my first father-in-law, Kaarlo.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I got to know him during school hours.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was with me on the same course.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife Marjukka Halttunen.
He'll remember his divorce as a pain in the ass.
After a relatively long struggle, the children were shared.
Not in two parts, but in one way that the daughter went to my mother and the boy to me.
I did not think that it was a good solution, and I understand that the children are pretty much in agreement now as adults.
It is not uncommon in theatre circles that silver is divided.
In the case of me, some part of me was that I was working quite a bit.
I was stuck at the theater on almost every case.
Then there was television and radio on top of it.
I did a long day, and my family life suffered.
Maybe the day of the party is free.
Esko Roine is celebrating at Tampere's Workshop Theatre at the Mindenjahoist on 7 September.
The party will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
And that's where the exorcismist's gonna be.
I was at work for 50 years, and I was at work at sixty-five.
When such an easy moving play happened, I thought that we'd be holding the seventies now, so we can get them off with one rhythm.
According to Roette, there's no celebration on her birthday.
I think it's free, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have put some work on it for that day.
Or it's a weird night off, which I'm going to keep on the night off, Roine says.
The aviation industry is concerned about the chain of production
Some of the smaller UK aircraft manufacturers are concerned that the supply chain production capacity problems may be hampered by the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the production chain of aircraft are currently enjoying the unexpected number of aircraft and engine development plans that are taking place at the same time.
Aviation and defence
At the same time as some enjoy the order drop, the capacity problems and price pressure at the production chain have been warned.
"It is absolutely true that price pressure exists, especially now that production is causing challenges," says Craig Gallagher, Chairman of MB Aerospace, which is one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing some 240 suppliers of pilot-English aviation production, we need more capacity.
"Do strategies and investment plans reflect these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure about that.
Above all, we need more investment in new production equipment and machinery needed to achieve these production volumes", says Gallagher.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft construction are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, the CEO of JJ Chrurchill, producing gas turbine wings, the company has a "sounding time" when several new construction plans were launched simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of an eye, we moved from very small production to a space where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we also had to try to push forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," says Churchill.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800 000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several operators believe that investment and coordination between small suppliers is necessary if the UK wishes to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the United States.
The director of Ford Aerospace and the engineer of fine mechanics from Tynes Geoff Ford says that the order fee should increase the confidence of the producers and want to expand and increase production capacity, as work will be sufficient.
"If this doesn't work out, we'll lose in the race against other countries," Ford says.
A few large players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior company for aircraft and engine lifts belonging to the FTSE 250 index bought parts of aircraft operating in Malaysia by GBP 75 million.
MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy new operations for start-up companies, but actually most of the production is slowing down the limitation of design and the number of engineers", says Gallagher MB of Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted from those large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the production chain are exaggerated.
Mr Bryson, director of the production unit for GKN aircraft, also acting as representative of the British aviation industry, considers that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
The supply chain is under pressure, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The most important thing is the introduction of new technologies and advanced processes," Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from the mistakes and are more careful now so that the number of buildings is not increased too quickly.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it suffered major difficulties when the company destroyed and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, director of Rolls Royce's production unit, says that the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain, which supplies most of the 18 000 parts required for the manufacture of the jet engine.
"You will certainly be incubated, but we believe that we have worked harder on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers as they prepare to increase their activity," Wood says.
According to Boeing's CEO James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for the increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus passenger jets, says that the company will do its utmost to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model in a month by 2018.
"Maybe some suppliers will not succeed, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation as well as support suppliers and look for options, but there are great problems to expect", says Brégier.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the principal's responsibility.
So this is the work of me and Airbus."
Hong Kong protest groups launch open elections in Beijing for the "time of non-nationalism"
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Activists supporting democracy are spreading to the streets of Hong Kong after China has rejected their open election requirements.
The groups in favour of Hong Kong's democracy stress that demonstrations can stamp and swear to make sure that the city begins with the "time of non-nationalism" in order to oppose the elections proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of protesters threatened the rain that would come to Hong Kong against the pious horizon as they walked the Occupy Central Group, who supported democracy, to organise a demonstration in front of the Council's premises responsible for the implementation of the laws on Sunday night, and there the protestors called on people to participate in a wide-scale session in order to demolish the city's financial quarter.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it prohibited voters' right to propose publicly candidates in 2017 in the mayors' elections, threatening these months of mental expression, which will further increase the city's oscillating.
Prosecutors will take part in the beginning of the demonstration of the Occupy Central movement in front of the central government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want fair and decent elections," says the 24-year-old owner of the website Dion Tse, who participated in Sunday's protest with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-y.
The government does not respect the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kong people.
China's highest law-making body, the People's Congress of China, approved plans for election changes, which will allow only two of the three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the proposal requires the approval of the 1200 nomination committee and, in the opinion of the opposition politicians, prevents the performer of different political views from accessing electoral flags.
The protesters will take part in the demonstration of mind in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government Building.
According to police estimates, more than 600 people are currently taking part in the demonstrations.
A large number of policemen followed when about 100 delegates led by the Scholarism student group gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, a Communist Party, was due to spend the night in Beijing after his arrival.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of the Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, he did not say the exact date when the roads were being blocked, but urged the participants to closely monitor progress in "in the next couple of weeks", adding that the city is officially moving to the "time of non-nationalism".
Benny or she'll answer press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said, on Sunday's demonstration, I would stand in front of the billboard representing two non-responsible characters in China.
That man will take control of the center with you!
The 17-year-old school invitations, Joshua Wong, who represent Scholarism, said earlier that the preparation of academic demonstrations is ongoing and are designed to be maintained at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their opinion by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have a social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Vice-President Li Fei of the People's Congress Committee informed journalists that defending the universal right to vote is a "time delay" and from some Hong Kong politicians who are trying to "discreet society and mislead it".
"Unusual proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time," Li says, by demanding that the electoral method should be created in such a way that it fits the actual situation of each society and the legislative framework.
The general bill on voting rights can only be adopted if a large majority, or two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-life legislative body, is in favour of this initiative, which means that 27 opposition members of the Government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might be drawn to a longer political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto law.
"It would damage business and city development," he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal poll organised by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose China's demands, and according to the requirements, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
Up to 172 000 people march for democracy on 1 July, while the march against the Occupy Central movement on 17 August attracted approximately 88 000 participants. The figures come from Hong Kong University, although the estimates of the police and organisers differ considerably from these figures.

The new idea is not supposed to please
This is the latest guide for network users to employees and managers, and it is distributed by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager website.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, it's a good idea to identify comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
If not, the idea is likely to be popular and self-evident — boring and everyday — or the benefits it brings are so little that it is not worth pursuing.
As a historian, Drew Gilpin of Harvard never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think he had anything to offer.
Now, as head of university, he repeats the same thing several times in order to achieve a wide range of messages.
In the opinion of the advertising consultant Bob Hoffman, TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news about the network does not mean that the internet would be good for advertising – just as the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad alternative for advertising.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson states that there is one word: together.
In one study, participants were told that they decided on the problem of cooperation, even though they actually worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and would solve more problems than those who were not told about cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a repeat pattern or relationship between the two units, performer Dave Paradise advises you to forget about Microsoft SmartArt and instead use the Charter.com program where you can choose 14 different relationships between.
For the purposes of the prohibition on safety risks, the mines in Mount Stuart Hospital
The specialist has been temporarily suspended from his post, and the British National Health System NHS ceased to direct patients to the hospital in question after the problems of the hospital were raised.
Two people applied for first aid at the Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that it has been in contact with 19 patients treated on 26 July and that they have been called "a violent clinical trial".
The Mount Stuart hospital was sorry about this and said that it had to be investigated after medical discharge.
The case came to the attention of the Torbay Hospital when two patients in Mount Stuart applied for its first aid because of eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all examined on the same day required correction.
Torbay’s hospital and the hospital district of South Devon and Torbay have not led patients to treatment since the occurrence of Mount Stuart’s problems.
David Sinclair, an interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, leading Torbay Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem in its early stages and we were able to contact all the patients in question quickly.
Whenever we direct patients to the service provider, we carry out quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest regulatory requirements and that its licenses are in order.
According to Gill Gant, Head of patient safety in the SouthDevon and Torbay Hospital, "patient safety is always with absolute priority, so it is important that these cataracts are not performed for as long as we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, who manages Mount Stuart Hospital, asked "unfortunately for all patients who suffered complications".
The company was informed that "you know, when we learned about the possible problem, we and later all the patients concerned were called from Torbay Hospital".
This specialist has been authorised by Ramsay Health Care since 2005, and has been registered by a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4 537 cataract surgery in various parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the operations he has performed have been excellent, and the percentage of complications has been below 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily removed from office until the matter has been investigated.
What's "4chan"?
The worst-case anonymous communication website published the first photos leaked by publishers
What exactly is the "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option in his publication of stolen images?
"4chan" was set up in 2003. It has raised a communication website that is as much as a source of praise.
The site is divided into a number of parts, i.e. the reporting tables where anonymous users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other web forums, users do not create a single, continuously used profile and their publications are not stored.
In the most popular reporting tables, comments may disappear less than a minute when the latest publications exclude them from the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchistic and surprising creative atmosphere.
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most well-known media in the network (such as "rickrolling" and "loolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also resulted in a lot of questionable or criminal content on the site.
The most popular notification table on the website is /b/, which is meant for mixed discussions and for whom NSFW content is regularly published (Not Safe For Work).
This can include summer porn, but also rough and shocking images. The anonymous hacker published the stolen images of the celebrities on this release table during the weekend.
The American CytRx invests in research and development of anticancer drugs
CytRx aims to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company producing biological medicinal products in Los Angeles, which was subject to the research and development of anti-cancer medicines, which had been subject to the sale of shares a short time ago.
The most promising medicine is aldoxorubis, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conductes clinical studies in the treatment of aldoxorubizine soft tissue disease, AIDS-related Kapos’ sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It's like a controlled missile that goes directly to a tumour and not to any other body, says Steven Kriegsma, CEO of CytRx.
My aldoxorubizine contains so-called co-ordinate technology that operates like a Troija horse.
It binds directly in the blood to a protein that also collects into tumours, which makes the medicine go directly into cancer cells.
I used to give up the medicine only in acidic environments, that is, cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to receive more and more doses of anticancer medicinal products.
"It's like a missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on the development of medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus collected $86 million for maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide in a pivotal 3-stage clinical trial for alternative treatment of soft tissue disease.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissue.
Alternative treatment is used to treat cancer when the initial treatment does not lead to results.
If a clinical study is successful, CytRx is planning to apply for authorisation for a drug from the US food and pharmaceutical management industry already in 2016, says Kriegsman.
The medicine could then be adopted in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published by CytRx in December in the previous clinical trial showed that aldoxorubizine is a promising treatment for soft tissue disease.
"For a long time the question was "we haven't seen any clinical information about how much it differs from the drug itself", says H. C. Wainwright & Co. investment analyst Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed many opinions that this treatment was different.
However, Fein says that it is difficult to predict the results and timetable of the current clinical trial because it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
"A lot of things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of medicines to the mining industry.
"The first place is a lot of money to find one of the gold salts, and the placement continues so long as that gold salt is found," he says.
The money is spent on research and development so long that the medicine can be commercialized.
Several shareholders have called on CytRx to court because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
In the proceedings, the company is accused of the fact that it hired DreamTeam Group, who claimed to hire people to write positive comments from CytRx and from another company in biotechnology to articles such as Forbes, Seeking Alphan, Motley Foolin and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the submissions, the articles did not show that the companies paid the fees to the writers.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that they had removed the articles "which were inconclusive in practice".
Several company articles were also deleted from other websites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to respond to complaints.
"I don't have time and energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who generally seek employment in the areas of biotechnology such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many sense the wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Views of the Analyst magazine
The price of CytRx’s shares rose to $8.08 on January 10, and then decreased in April to less than three dollars when the charges for the advertising of the shares came to the public.
According to the Analyst magazine, the claims and negative publicity have calculated the price of shares below their actual value.
"It's unfortunate", Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to bypass this matter as long as the perception is valid".
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of the shoot.
On Tuesday night, when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident, the photographer of a series of events in Finland, including the Law series, died on Tuesday night.
The cameraman described the armed robbery between a private police department and a fast food restaurant when he got hit by bullets.
He died quickly of injuries he suffered.
The police reported on the TMZ site that a person suspected of armed robbery, in addition to a cameraman, was killed in a shooting incident.
In the name of the Law, a series of first true TV programmes has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series is presented with MTV channels since the 1990s.
The issue of the outsider is a crucial element in the trial of the death of Ulvila today.
Anneli Auer is accused of the murder of her husband, Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Spanish court is now dealing with the case for the second time, because the Supreme Court returned it to the court with new evidence.
The purpose of court law is that the judgment will be given by the end of this year.
Auer’s right of care was released by Auer in 2011.
In that case, the court considered the external agent’s possibility to be sufficiently likely.
The district attorney Kalle Kulmala, in his opening speech, explained the prosecutor’s point of view of the murder and of the issues that exclude the outsider’s possibility.
In our view, the crucial question is whether the outsider who has killed Jukka Lahden Anneli Auer in a way and in time.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, Auer had announced that he would leave home and get divorce.
At some point, Lahti was moved to the kitchen where he held onto Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took the knife in the kitchen," Kulmala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several points prove that there was no outsider.
For example, there is no voice on the emergency phone recorder.
Auer's oldest daughter told me in the interrogation that she saw her husband leave the back door.
The liberal judgment issued in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecutor, the sight of the daughter can't be true.
"The star didn't see an outsider in the parents' bedroom, even though he visited there twice," Kulmala said.
The prosecution's new witness is connected to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has told me about what happened since the night of the murder at the hospital.
According to the woman, the daughter only told me at the hospital that she only saw the body of Lahde when she was at the scene of death in the fireplace.
Auer's defense intends to present to the court the lines of investigation of which, according to the defense, the police have not sufficiently investigated.
Three years ago, when the Visa Court released Auer’s charges, the court considered that the search had found a foreign man’s DNA as a reference to an outsider.
The sample later proved to be the dna of a researcher working at the Central Crime Police Laboratory.
That's when a sample of 700 people took place on masseering.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded", defence attorney Juha Manner said.
Another defense of new witnesses reports of a potential outsider.
A woman from Ulvilia told the police about a bourgeois man who, according to a woman, had confessed to the act.
The police questioned the man in the summer.
The D.A. made a decision not to have anything to do with a homicide.
The prosecution made a request for an investigation, because the prosecutor suspects that she lied to him in her report.
Another new witness of defense is a nurse who worked at the Central Hospital of the 100th century on the night of his death.
In December, hundreds of dollars were convicted of the murder of Auer's life sentence.
According to the judgment of the Court of Justice of the Court of First Instance, the reports of the children of Auer, the sounds of the outside agent missing from the emergency centre, as well as the time required by the cost of the events, are wary against the outsider.
The judgment came up with a vote of 2-1.
A minor judge wrote that evidence which is conflicting with the criminal case must be interpreted as a benefit of the accused.
That is why the daughter’s report must be interpreted in such a way that, despite the contradictions in the report, it had found an outsider exiting the back door.
Two of the oldest children in Auer have been called courteous.
For the first time, the daughter was personally heard last year in the spirit of the Sanctuary.
When he was heard in court, he no longer remembered what happened at the night of the murder.
Auer’s second oldest child named his mother’s killer at a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me that he heard the night of the murder behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer planned to kill for six months.
The son has no obligation to say anything in court.
The trial will continue today with the hearing of Anneli Auer.
The hearing with Auer will continue tomorrow, if necessary.
Ms Auer is currently sitting in prison for more than seven years on sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin's involvement at the G20 be allowed?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him the first of many.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Bisbane in November, and Australia is very keen to discuss whether or not his entry should be permitted.
The Punkrock activist group Pussy Riot called on Australia this weekend to ban Putin's participation in a summit involving more than 4,000 representatives of the world's most influential states.
"This person has nothing to do with the G20 meeting," said Maria Alyokhina, in Sydney's fully packed opera house with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas event.
Kiova has warned me that he is on the brink of a complete war, and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorus", or "New Russia." Is it necessary for us to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said, "I'll make a decision."
According to Mike Callaghan, the director of the G20 Research Centre in Lowy Institute, the Australians cannot decide who is taking part in the meeting, even though the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia can decide who it will let go of, but it is an international meeting," she says.
Just as New York is hosting UN meetings or Washington hosting International Monetary Fund meetings, "It is not my job to deny someone invited to come," Callahan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said, "I'm taking a decision" after Russia's gross actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia is not entitled to decide alone.
"It is, however, an important issue that I will weigh a lot on, and I believe that other countries will do so in the coming weeks," he says.
People are taking part in an anti-war meeting in Mariupol, Eastern Ukraine.
The event lasts for two days, with a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest emerging economies, with a total of around two-thirds of the world's population, representing 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as some specifically invited guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given a questionable task of balancing the gap between various interests under high public pressure.
In his view, the best way to deal with the Prime Minister is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take advantage of this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make his account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to provide an explanation of his actions," Callaghan says.
There is a clear increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world is waiting for them to take these things up.
The Russians are preparing weapons for attack on Ukrainian military base at Donetsk Airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Put will attend the meeting, and Callaghan does not necessarily know until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly points out that "I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine, because I desperately want to go to Bisbane in November".
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, is taking Putin’s entry in Australia "a lot of reservations", but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the prime ministers and foreign ministers to discuss with other states and the G20 as to whether Putin should be allowed to enter Australia.
It is an international, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After some tragic events following Malaysian Airlines and in the absence of proper cooperation in terms of compassion, responsibility and flight security, and now, as thousands of Russian soldiers patrol the Ukrainian border, I think that most Australians are very determined to welcome Putin to Australia.
The business world of Germany is critical of "self-critical" Berlin
Some of the German top business leaders warn that Germany has become "too trusting" and "problemous" because government policy is threatening the competitiveness of the country.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of the government is happening at the same time as Europe's largest economy shows signs of slowing down, which gives rise to concerns as to whether it can revolve economic growth in an area of the euro area that is in place.
Business leaders' criticism is the result of the fierce opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wage and the calculation of the retirement age of certain long-term workers for 63 years.
"I think the greatest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably leads to a sense of self-confidence", says Kurt Buck, CEO of the world's largest chemical manufacturer, BASF.
EU economy
He is of the opinion: "Usually, we feel that we are doing well, we have money for use and unemployment at a relatively low level, so what is the problem?"
I think there's a great danger here.
It is clear from the German Government's policy that we do not focus on growth and not on the favourable environment for businesses, but instead we concentrate much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain entities.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German industrial organization, "The German situation is now good.
However, in the next ten years every developed economy must change. ...In Germany, the reform programme does not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost in balance, even if it has slowed down again.
However, the decline in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of German exporting-winnered companies to foreign shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP declined by 0.2 per cent over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB more difficult to fight low inflation and could make a quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like to see the government 'returning from public spending to public investment', for example by focusing on increases in future consumption in infrastructure rather than pensions.
According to Kerber, the Merkel Government will destroy the fruits produced by its socio-democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder in the early 2000s with strict policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreeder, the CEO of Stiftung Familienunnernehmen Foundation for Family Business, "the situation in Germany remains good compared to other countries.
It has been welcomed by businesses and not so much by government policies. .
The French neighbourhood example has shown that spending on social assistance and limiting the freedom to conduct a business is the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment banker described the situation in a more straightforward way, in other words, that the recent decisions of the government are "catastrophe".
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has worked so hard to please voters.
This is my main concern at the moment," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition have failed to address the fundamental weaknesses of the policy that have caused the cost of competitiveness to the industry.
Ashton Kutcher handicraft at the music festival prevented securitymen from accessing the fan
The actor Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach Cantrimus Festivals in India, California, where he was reported to have been in a fight with a tight securityman.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to have run into a fight with a securityman at the Cantrimus Festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him in the backstage at the Stagecoach Cantrimus Festival in California, and then the situation got out of hand, says the TMZ website.
Kutcher was in VIP rooms when a young woman approached him to greet him and cash him.
When the star of the Men's Tribes went to say hello to the fan, the super-intelligible security guard went in and caused the doll.
The actor and the security guard were in a handhound, and Kutcher's friends had to go between themselves to hold Kutcher, TMZ says.
After his ex-wife Demi Moore from Kutcher meets Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is the star of the former '70s show.
The doll happened shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically been removed from his standard performer cards after his published video in which he calls the series "bad" and calls fans not to watch it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher participates in the Stagecoach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake", calls the series "bad" and urges people not to watch.
Baltic bacteria killed a vacationer
The bacteria from the Caribbean, a popular German tourist destination, has been affected by six people.
One of the patients is in a coma.
Vibrio vulgarus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and in other parts of the world, but it is found most in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria spread most effectively in the breakwater of more than 20 degrees.
"The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right", Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS) told the Local magazine.
The bacteria are equally found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the sick had been on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died in early August.
Another retired person has been in a coma for three weeks now, and it is possible that his leg should be shot.
He went swimming near Ahrenshop's little wound in his leg.
The sick person went to the hospital after he noticed on his way home that his leg had become blue.
Doctors identified blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus in the leg.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea if he knew about the danger", the sick wife, Sonja Bruehl, told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious illness and damage to the blood poisoning patient and this family could have been avoided if the information had been better provided. For example, the place of residence could have been put in the brochure.
LAGuS told the Dpa news agency that the doctor had asked for the next infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official notice was given.
Cool temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"The results of the test were shown to have significantly reduced the strain of V. vulnicus", says Dr. Will.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnicus, cholera-induced family members, is particularly dangerous if a person has a history of chronic liver disease and impaired immune response such as HIV or diabetes mellitus and elderly people.
Men’s risk of disease is greater than women’s, as the oestrogen has been detected from a protective pathogen.
If you get a bacterial disease, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
The probability of death following a wound by bacteria is about 25 per cent.
V. V. Vulnificus can also occur by eating marine animals contaminated by it, although according to Dr. Will, in these cases this is not an infectious case.
Marine food pollution is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused poisoning the previous time in 2010, when two people died.
Vino Kekkonen: The breast was removed due to cancer attacks
The 80 - year - old singer Viano Kekkonen is working and is working hard but has also had to fear for her health.
After all, it's incredible that the radiating Veo Kekkonen has been up to 80 years.
He himself is amazed at how all of a sudden there can be so much of those years of age.
I haven't quite realized I'm so old.
80 years sounds like a lot of people, but Veno Kekkonen laughs.
It's his birthday, Vieno Kekkonen, who's spending time with his family.
At the end of August he was given a birthday party by the folk music and retirement association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on Kekkola's stage, in the same place my grandfather was born.
I was all over the party, and the birthday hero tells me about the occasion where the stage measured for three hundred was full of congratulations.
A few days later, in Muhoks, they gathered themselves together to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vienna Kekkonen remembers following him when he was young.
And now we're both of this age!
Vino Kekkonen is laughing.
There are only few aspects of this long career that have not been seen in public in Vienna Kekko.
One thing he has never said before in public: 2006 he was removed from his second breast.
There was a lack of clarity on my chest at a point in which it was decided to remove it completely.
Well, it wasn't finally cancer, which, of course, I was happy about.
A new breast was made during the same operation, so it was a very big operation.
Vino Kekkonen has not thought that he had lost his own breast in vain, for knowledge of the unclear discovery would have been hard to bear, and that cannot be done without.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen tells and notes that for younger people, loss of your own breast is certainly more difficult.

Makes the farmer guilty of the state of the sea
The debate on the weak Baltic Sea and its links with Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts has been destroyed politically forintelligent opinions.
In particular, during the summer, the Helsinki Sanomat and Yle have continued their agriculture responsibility for nutrient discharges to the Baltic Sea.
Fast measures to control emissions have been required for the same breath.
The average farmer seems to have a few environmental investigators and their help to the familiar suppliers compared to the over-the-counter nutrition expert.
The farmer is aware that the nutrients can not come from cultivation if the field is sown with the same amount of nutrients as the crop is harvested there.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires careful food monitoring and reporting.
The authorities are monitoring compliance.
The nutrients stored in the field have been washed into the water streams even after the loading restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for many years.
Farmers will and will continue to work on reducing nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should realise that access to zero levels is impossible.
"If we want to have an agricultural production equivalent to consumption, we just have to accept that this is the case", says Jyrki Aakula, Director of the MTT Environmental Research (MT 29.8.).
The past summer brought large blue peoples to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers were quite agreed that the mild was able to grow from the sea’s own phosphorus stocks.
The phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is partly withdrawn from the land of the coastal states for the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The cleaning of waste water from growing cities on the shores of the Baltic Sea until the end of the 20th century was carried out.
The problem also concerned Helsinki’s waste water, and it was not seen as a problem of pollution on its own shores.
The pollution of the shores was prevented by building waste water pipelines on the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of the water directed there has improved over the years.
Foods that have ended at times in the sea will not leave, even if agriculture will be completely stopped in Finland.
Yet, every summer's debate and the accusations presented are always about agriculture today.
The public debate has created a farmer responsible for the condition of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to achieve political passions.
The Greens, under the leadership of their President-in-Office of the Environment, Ville Niinistö, are making major changes to agricultural environmental standards.
The Niinistö has been using the summer's restful discussion as a populace.
The Niinistö has been responsible for the interests of producers' organisations in the field of old age, and it has been seen as the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be some limit on political rhetoric.
Most specific projects in the protection of water are based specifically on cooperation between RTD, farmers and environmental management.
The attacking species of Niinisto serve more urban green sounds fishing than water conservation.
I guess that's the point.
The green ones are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, the MKT shall be responsible for ensuring the survival of its members.
It is difficult to trade costly changes to farmers unless a substitute for their costs is found.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is cuts from other agricultural funds.
Reverting mines tax does not go through: Palmer
The latest attempt by the Abbott government to throw the mine tax into the trash basket appears doomed, for Clive Palmer has declared that his senators reject it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party is also concerned that the Government has included in the new initiative a rule that could limit employers' additions to compulsory pension payments until 2034.
The government used a qualified majority in Parliament's lower room on Monday to speed up the annulment process through a general confusion and a clear intimidation of the Labour Party.
It put on the side the original annulment initiative, in which the Senate had made significant changes in the past, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described, above all, in relation to taxes, pension payments, social security and social assistance for families.
Initially, this was an initiative aimed at repealing the 'non-profitable' mining tax as well as other decisions, such as a low-income pension tax (EUR 3.6 billion savings), a bonus for earnings (EUR 1.3 billion) and a bonus for school-age children ($4.7 billion).
Clive Palmer, leader of Palmer United Party (PUP), did not accept the transfer of the government.
"The planned removal of mining tax is not accepted in the Senate without a pension payment for low incomes, a bonus for earnings-related benefits and a bonus for children of school age", she twitat.
The Government needs support from independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Mr Chris Bowe, Minister of State for Finance, accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory amount of pension payments, giving the Minister of Finance all the power to take decisions.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay further increases, so that the target of 12% of pension payments for the Labour Party would go up to 2034.
"It is in no way acceptable, and the Labour Party will naturally oppose anything," Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future increases.
Man's body was found on Brighton's beach.
Sussex's police picked up an unidentified man's body before the dawn of the afternoon rise, and the cops closed the area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
The police and the medical examiner are working to determine the conditions under which the body was placed on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers are going through the list of missing persons to find out if missing persons have any contact with the body.
The police have not yet been able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, one death victim with an accidental explosion at the border
According to the Piedras Negras police, the accidental explosion in the customs building at the Mexican and US border caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas acts as an operational director of the local police in the city border of Texas.
He told Associated Press that the woman who died on Sunday explosion had skull damage and five others suffered burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred in customs officials' nights.
The cause of the explosion is being investigated, but the authorities believe that the gas generated by the explosion is being collected.
The explosion didn't affect border security.
Three Atlantic City casinos closes in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
A male customer is playing at the Showboat casino, which is to close his doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means, at the same time, this neon-light metropolis, known as the money machine's shield, can no longer be counted for the game income.
More than 5,000 workers will be unemployed in the closures of Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press News Office explained.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns out to be light.
Three casinos, one of which only had been able to operate for two years, are expected to close the city's most recent disaster at the Atlantic Club story only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, over 25% of the city's casino employees, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, the New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for a poor economy affected by Atlantic City, the AP News Office writes.
However, the local gambling industry has received much more competitors when casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania drag a large part of Atlantic City once into such huge casinos.
Even those who have been opposed to gambling before are looking at their own share of money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule is difficult to accept
According to Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new estimate by the institutional supplier Areva that Olkiluoto's triple reactor can only be used commercially 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennois, the director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction works are already well-informed and the number of works in progress is well known.
The TVO will continue to evaluate data obtained from Avava.
Silvennoinen states in the communication that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Alva today submitted to TVO an updated schedule of Olkiluto 3, according to which construction work on the triangular reactor would be completed in mid-2016 and the commercial activity could begin in 2018.
According to Areva's announcement, recent delays in the project have mainly been due to the approval of reactor automation systems, which were received in April.
This was before four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluto 3 had initially to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed once since then.
TVO and Arava have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
Dispute wood in an arbitration court where Areva has demanded compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
TVO, in turn, considers Areva’s requirements unfounded and requires the company to receive approximately EUR 1.8 billion.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
The international leaders met today in the context of the 24th International Water Week in Stockholm, calling on energy and water operators to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time, to ensure sufficient water and energy production for the growing population.
The theme of the water week 2014 is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning water, and nearly all energy is needed.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two reserves are also an integral part of sustainable development and must always be borne in mind when making global decisions.
In the opening of the water week, Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute, organised by the Water Week, said that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and there is therefore an urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water operators in order to find solutions that allow all nations in the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, who received the Water Prize this year, described water as a basis for growth that needs both society as a whole and other sectors.
They have to mobilise these assets.
Briscoe added that "there is no permanent solution anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that make up the ring.
During the week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water operators over a hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Originally, Professor John Briscoe from South Africa receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty, King Charles XVI of Sweden, at the ceremony held at the Stockholm City Hall on Thursday, September 4.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre which provides research data and information to decision-makers to make decisions that make sense for water and sustainable development.
Home Flying of Dead Foreign bodies in Miami: Cost of Body Flying
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees transported to Miami fell, and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of years earlier, and this certainly has not been the last of its quality.
Every year, more than 1,000 Mediterranean migrants die illegally trying to cross the United States border.
For the first city, we're ready to die.
It is ironic, though, that after reaching the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place to stay: either a asylum, an effort board up and down, or a place to spend time waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people imagine dying there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
In urban areas favoured by migrants, an disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily resident in a country are constantly working on death and domestic return.
It is estimated that 20% of the bodies that die in South Florida will be flown away, which is more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, short form of professional caves in words, human residues) are flown to their homeland from the international airport of Miami.
From 1964 onwards, Pierson, the largest company in the sector, according to the CEO, is estimated to be around 80% of this traffic abroad.

The more immigrants move into popular cities, the more they die there too.
Even after death, homecoming has its expense.
Miami is the main airport of the American Airlines airline for Latin American flights, and the table figures describe the airline's return to the country of origin of human remains in 2013.
The return of bodies to the country is not cheap: prices can vary from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
The religious, cultural and general health requirements related to the flying and delivery of human residues also vary.
The migrant communities of the cities of migrant interest sometimes organise funeral communities to help the cost, because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help the process and the deaths are often young people who do not have insurance.
Some credit institutions and non-formal health insurance programmes were born from entities founded by the Italian, Jewish and Greek groups living in New York — the first group of migrants in the United States.
New generations of Mexican, Chinese, Filipino and Bangladeshi migrants are now operating in many of their preferred cities.

Death abroad is always causing difficulties, as few who have moved abroad plan to make their last rests of the migratory city.
For example, in Dubai, for foreigners who have died without a will, the Sharia Act is respected, even if the laws on the recovery of a deceased country are different.
The entire assets of the deceased shall be frozen and subsequently distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
The network of Aer Lingus, which is central to Dublin, is carrying human remains (
2013) reflects the multicultural population structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline suspended the service but resumed it in 2004 after obtaining negative feedback from those who moved from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person walks through the favorite city of migrants or living there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to the emigrant city is an open declaration of the settler’s way of looking at life, not death.
However, death in a migrant city abroad means taking the most powerful and irreversibly decisions – whether or not it wants to be part of a local or global community, the universe, the earth, the short-term or the eternal.
The Centre and the European Union of Left make an issue of inequality
The opposition parties to the centre and the left-wing alliance intend to ask the government an interim question of the income of the low incomes and the increase in inequality.
The parties want to raise the debate on the problems of people's livelihoods, which are driven by poor economic development and aggravating unemployment.
The growing inequality is also evident between the various parts of the country and within large cities, the parties point out when they inform.
In next year's budget, cuts and tax increases are directed at low incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and normal employment, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing are still expensive.
In fact, there are almost half a million people already unemployed, and the parties say that they do.
The problems of living in work have also become worse.
The parliamentary groups of the centre and left-hand side will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the basic Finns, has already announced that it would leave the issue of police and internal security resources.
The Parliament's guilty session will start tomorrow.
The New York City West Indian Day is about to begin.
In New York City, Caribbean culture is once again entering the spotlight, where the West Indian Day is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and it is where politicians see each other and become visible.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It takes note of the celebration of traditional carnivals prior to the fasting season, and part of it is dancers who bear complex, often black - made costumes.
Eric Adams, President of the Brooklyn region, is the festival champion this year, but there is also a great deal of other policy-known faces.
The parade is an excellent opportunity for present and candidate politicians to welcome the audience a week before the elections.
In the past years, however, violence has also been included in the parade weekend.
The police have said that they want to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including monitoring the activities of the nearby gangs.
Is it worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows about rhetorical questions, right?
You don't have to answer that question.
This figure of speech, that is, the question that is not expected to be answered, but who suggests in a certain direction in the direction of a specific answer, has a taste for both high-flying speeches and more daily exchanges of words.
The early words of Cicero's famous Catilina's prosecution are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same is true of my wife's questions: "Why shouldn't I warm up five days old chicken for children?"
Why are you so tight?
The difference is a better word for a rhetorical question.
The force of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the issue is open, and the public is encouraged to accept it.
The mysteriously rhetorical question gives us the idea that no one full-headed could agree with it.
In the 1800s, author of the material writing guide David Williams described the retort of the question as "any addressed words that are beautifully designed to produce a strong sense of truth about the subject, and at the same time the challenge they have posed is impossible to disagree with".
Reconciliation Skills
Retorical questions can be followed by a desire to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several successive rhetorical questions designed to express grief or anger are called epiplex.
For example, Job uses them in his appeal to the Almighty: "What do you benefit from turning me over --?"
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see it the same way you see it?
There are also chain of rhetorical questions about my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do something right?
In addition, there is a so-called hypofora, which is the case when a question is asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg, which is a sexual fear for all women?
Parru!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food that the children have eaten, and where could they become bitter?"
This chicken.
Who the fuck fed them?
You.
Strangely, the rhetorical question usually does not tend to bend, even though rhetoric means bending skills.
If you are trying to talk to someone around you instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted, or if you try to charm someone about self - control, you might want to use rhetorical questions economically.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than trying to make one person accept their own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument "And it's not nice when it's so sunny out there", the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of his claim, which binds the speaker and the public more closely.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no different opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached, rather than seeking unanimity, the speaker may seem, well, to be self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question points to a weak argument.
The rhetorical issue in the newspaper headlines is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did the pyramids of alien beings support?
In both cases, the risk is that the question can lead to an answer that differs from the reference.
"Do you think of the same thing as us?" belonged to the United Kingdom Conservatives' risky campaign clause in the general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
For some of these cases there has become a hobby, and so-called QTWAIN questions (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, questions whose answer is not) are popular.
A few years ago, one of my friends organized a competition that looked for the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang", which was sang by the pop star Gary Glitter before he discovered the children's sexual abuse.
The writer has also written the book "You Talkin' to Me?"
Researcher: The time of the federal co-compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, it was still thought in many countries that the federal state could be some kind of compromise with the conflict, says Saari.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian Channel that peace in eastern Ukraine calls for discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
Putin says it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
According to Saare, Ukraine's transition to a federal state is a priority for Russia's objectives.
Ukraine certainly suspects that Russia would therefore try to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
If the federal solution were not reached, the second option could be some frozen conflict from the point of view of Russia, where Russia would effectively control Luhansky and Donetski, Saari estimates.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the East.
Russia has objected, even though, for example, the Russian-minded rebels themselves have said that their troops have been fighting "loose, voluntary Russian soldiers".
Director of Up: Designated by Katas for a powerful task
The brick reminds me that the image of the action is new and yet to be realized.
In his view, it is the idea that Katainen would, in some way, coordinate or even lead to the Commission's work on matters relating to competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the Commission's priorities for the new period is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That's how it's at the heart of the Commission's power," Tiilikainen says.
The Tiilikainen believes that Katainen's background, economic expertise and role during the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be unsolicited, i.e. that Katais would not be under his own authority.
Instead, Kata would be a team leader in the area of competitiveness and employment in the EU, where she could have portfolios in addition to the portfolio of the Economic Commissioner.
In practice, team management could mean, for example, planning and guidance.
Mothers of soldiers: up to 15 000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organization, up to 15 000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine over the past two months and there are now more than 7 000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the Rostovin City Hospital near the Ukrainian border is full of wounded in the war in Ukraine.
The mothers of the soldiers collect information from the soldiers' relatives.
The Military Federation NATO has estimated that there are more than a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
With BB-Andte's alcohol use, there's gonna be a case after a little drink.
Big Brother Jussi and Ande drove on Monday night to think about the life of the BB house.
On Monday night, Jussi, on the way to the basement, had a fitness wheel with Andte from Kartano's apartments.
The twins wondered what the viewers thought they were doing.
It's not that ti till you see it, Andte said.
I think most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
A possible celebration or assignment will only form a fraction of the life of the BB house.
It's more of a wait and wonder and talk and live.
And you, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday night, the people of Cartano spent the night in wet signs, and alcohol was especially given to Ande’s speaker.
Jussi asked Andtel if the parties had made a man's life more meaningful in the house now that he had been able to talk to these other residents in a small hive.
A little drink, and then there's a case, Andte admitted it.
Look at the ISTV video!
Anna Abreu reveals her body touch at Me Women
Anna Abreu tells me that she decided to lose her job two years ago.
At that time, tired of working, Anna thought she'd get more energy with weight loss.
Fred Montana / Splash News
Give me a couple of years ago a dream about the Victoria's Secret type of body.
My body plan was Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, Anna's gonna tell the paper.
Anna, who shows her body with gigs and music videos, says that she's not a luster, even though she's been named like that.
Vina Kytöjoki
Anna's fine with Timm. She's training at the gym. She's playing boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can lift a certain amount of weight on the gym points to Anna.
Sometimes the pop star gives himself permission to gloat.
If I'm delicious, I'm really nervous.
Sometimes I'm pulling unhealthy dudes, and I don't know if there's gonna be any more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
If I do something bad to my body, I'm gonna be disgusting.

Anna says she likes her body.
The profit sharing of companies will please shareholders but will not increase
Did the heads of Australian stock exchange companies today just try to please a large group by giving the shareholders a larger profit distribution and by buying back their shares?
Is it the decision-making power to move from companies to shareholders serving by the government?
The most important issue is the sharing of profits, which occurred last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of buy-back programmes and by sharing more profits have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that the consumption of capital will decrease faster than the analysts have predicted, and this fact will cause many people to ask whether there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and whether sufficient attention will be paid to the growth of the near future and the long-term future.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business through other means.
More funding is obtained from cheap stock markets, for example.
From a company point of view, this is sensible because the loan is currently cheap, while there is no capital.
However, even if the funds purchased from the loan market were not taken into account, it is clear that the lack of transparency towards shareholders is primarily financed by the fact that the company uses less money to invest.
The net result of this wave of purchase programmes (and the withdrawal of profit investment plans) is a decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period the "capital reduction period" during which companies have sought to keep the number of shares below.
As part of the same plan, companies have less and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the buy-back programmes amounted to USD 3.7 billion and the expected value of the unrealised capital projects amounted to USD 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it sees capital spent in a clear title of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that this trend exists, informal evidence has existed for months.
The director of the Australian Central Bank Glenn Stevens considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies needed a little more "combativity" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as slow spending on capital generally leads to negative effects for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says: "The estimates of the consumption of their capital by reporting companies have on average decreased by four per cent over the previous two years.
Estimates of free cash flow levels have risen by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick look seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and stock markets, but it is also some kind of proof of the company's integrity.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO said that the price of a share for a short time isn't important, I'd be... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not true.
Managing Directors follow very closely the prices of shares and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of directors are determined by the value of the shares, and the role of directors depends on it.
The CEOs would like to say that some decisions (if they were business transactions, increased investment in an organisation or profit sharing) may not always be immediately recommended, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short-term approach to the investment market.
That is why the current lack of conservativeity seems to be an acceptance of short-term objectives.
However, it was too clear during the reporting period that the emphasis was on reducing future capital consumption, and more sustainable companies were encouraged.
The large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held one in the process of reducing capital consumption, but many of the other companies also acted in the same way – part of the obligation and part because they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, do investors push companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse's strategic Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more revenue, as profits of other more traditional fixed-rate investment products have decreased as the central banks have suddenly reduced interest rates worldwide to bring more money on the market.
In this way, investors have been forced into the capital market to seek profits and, in turn, they pressure companies to share more profits.
The shareholders have also made it quite clear to the companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would prefer money as more and more investors approach their retirement age.
The statistics from the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution contributed much to the cost cuts of companies and not to the increase in turnover.
Public leaking cases appear to be a breach of information security or an e-mail account
According to Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources, an unknown hacker who leaked videos online wonders information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of women in a chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of them have reported that their images are counterfeit, while others have said that they had long since been removed.
There are a lot of pictures and there's been a group called Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
What about the pictures and videos real, and where were they loaded?
The most common source for images – an inconspicuous and thorough attack on the Apple iCloud service – is the most unlikely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house, which are responsible for trying to penetrate the company’s own systems regularly.
"The hacking of a large scale for Apple iCloud service is unlikely.
Nor does the original publisher claim that the claim should be correct”, notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
The simplest and more likely explanation for these hackers associated with the public (and the hackers dealing with less famous people every day) is the leaking of an e-mail address and password, either by guessing or by e-mailing information, i.e. by cheating on the person's knowledge to log in to a real-looking site, after which these data are used against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used to store settings on iPhone phones and, above all, to copy images when they are transferred to the Cloud server.
User account can be registered with iCloud by giving this email address and password, and then their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-stage identification ("two factor authority"), i.e. an additional protection against entrenched entry into the account, whereby the owner’s mobile phone is sent a code before it can be registered.
However, it is rare to use 2FA characteristics either because they are not known or because they are considered to be difficult.
Apple will continue to examine whether all the information is based on its iCloud service and, if this is the case, the extent to which users’ accounts were penetrated.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this issue at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the " Forgot password" link in the Apple iCloud service first by collecting the email addresses of the public, for example, in the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that publishers have used the same password in several services, when passwords were stolen through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos claims that the images are genuine, but does not tell when they were taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures were taken a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a hard time.
I feel sorry for all the other people who were affected by the hacking," he wrote in his tweet.
However, the independent IT expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that he has removed images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Modern smartphones regularly record images of cloud computing because they often do not have space for a large number of user images.
Apple’s iPhone standard setting is to store images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft’s Windows Phones stores images for OneDrive.
Independent service providers such as Dropbox offer automatic images and data storage services.
"People take and remove images, but they don't understand that they're being downloaded from the account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "The withdrawn does not always mean deleted", he says.
Pictures and videos can be stored for years.
If someone gets access to the user's e-mail address and password, they can download all photos and videos that have been sent by e-mail.
From Apple's service, images can be downloaded for Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot that was claimed to present videos and images from Windows PC to date.
Two-step identification protects against such hacking because it requires anyone who tries to copy an existing account to another device to provide the original user’s device, usually a code sent to the mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo provide a two-step identification to the account, but it is not yet known whether or not those public persons were using the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images in which they claim to be are not real.
The representative of Ariana Grande has said that the images in which Grande is claimed to be "completely counterfeit".
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: "The pictures taken as they were, they're just, you don't understand.
Let me break the rumors from the roots to the beginning.
Cluley's bringing up another option.
Because of the subjects of the hacking, the people of the public were in their accounts, someone who handled their social media accounts or regularly managed their e-mails.
"I'd like to know if there's any actor agencies or some representative on the subject," he's wondering.
However, those persons of the public shall not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed or helped configure one or more of the victims of the security attack, and secretly changed the system so that all the information can be restored.
This happened in the case of the Floridan Christopher Chaney, who received the title "Hollywood hacker", where the hacker distributed pictures of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis e-mail accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment in December 2012.
Chaney was accused of entering the e-mail accounts of over 50 entertainment industry people in secret between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of the star in the name of this stylist, and then published pictures online.
Later, Chaney apologized for saying that his actions "I'm sure they were one of the worst violations of privacy that can be imagined".
Chaney was also claimed to have two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case ofChaney, stars' email accounts were breached, and they were modified so that someone sent their data forward after the password was changed."
Cluley says that the obsessive activity of hackers breaking into these accounts is "a reminder of the collection of butterflyes".
They just want to collect information like this.
In this case, it is possible that someone had encountered a list of these accounts and login data for services such as Dropbox.
Hackers have also been able to try to penetrate for a long time
or they were able to access someone's e-mail account information, such as the address book, and then fished on other persons' information.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud safety gap.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by terrorists associated with al-Qaida in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to have been imprisoned in 44 Fijian peacekeepers. This terrorist group conquered the crossing point on the hills of Golan last week and forced UN troops to surrender.
The peacekeepers have been missing since the middle of the week, and there is no record of their location.
In the same way, ministers participating in the UN Conference of small emerging island states, including the Australian Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon at the summit, and he has offered Australia's help to save the peacekeepers in the lost.
"I am convinced that Australia will help the UN in everything it can, including providing intelligence assistance," he said to the AAP news service on Monday.
We're very closely connected to all the partners and friends of the intelligence network... to make sure that we can locate them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already assured Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Filipino Peacekeeper group held in its military army army was reported to have escaped from various parts of the same controversial territory.
The UN has monitored the hills of Golan since the ceasefire of Syria and Israel in 1974.
The hunters are trying to steal your money by means of a carbon tax annulment initiative, warning the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
The hunters take advantage of the carbon tax annulment salad to steal money, ACCC warns.
The Competition Authority's SCAMwatch unit has warned consumers and businesses not to trust too well-sounding offers of government agencies offering thousands of dollars of credit.
The hunters may use the numbers on the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save in the purchase of goods after the carbon tax has been abolished and offering it up to $7 000, says the warning.
It may sound very convincing because they have discovered the individual information of the victim that they use in trying to obtain banking information or in trying to make the victim pay the fee.
They're discussing current topics to fool the victim.
The hunters use more than a carbon tax fraud to get access to money, and their stories are more advanced, and they use topical things to build a scam around them.
Also, the MH370 aircraft lost by Malaysia Airlines and the death of Robin Williams have been inspired by scams.
ACCC instructs to contact the company by means of self-registered contact information rather than the contact information provided by the caller if there is any doubt about the identity of the player representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or an e-mail from someone who claims to represent the government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the abolition of the carbon tax, you will be on your guard.
If you believe that you have been deceived and given personal information or transferred money to the fraud account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true — for example, free money shared by the government — it is likely to be true.
Financial words: Lipponen challenges the EU's Russian sanctions
The former Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, is critical of the EU's sanctions against Russia in an interview with the Economics.
Russia's policy of priority is to drive its own interests.
This is not necessarily forced to be effective", says Lipponen at the interview.
Lipponen has started the work of the EC Centre for Economic Affairs as an investigator for the business of the Arctic regions.
He is concerned that the EBRD, as well as the European Investment Bank, suspended Russia's project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"This means, for example, that environmental projects of the Northern Dimension with clear prospects go to ice," says Lipponen in an interview.
The freezing of funding is now hampered by cooperation, which Lippusen believes can be difficult to rebuild if there is no confidence.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region will continue as large as before.
He is currently reporting to the EC on Finnish Arctic policy and business opportunities in the north.
It does not affect the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report will look forward, talk about decades," he says.
It is rare that Norway comes into a shallow water or nearby facility, says Vesa Heinonen Museum of Nature Pedagogi.
In Suvilahti, Vasaan was seen swimming near the beach on Sunday.
According to Heinose, the elephant is likely to have come after the Suvilahti food.
It's not a mess.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's tip.
According to him, for example, the Sundom Bridge, especially in the spring and autumn, can be seen with the Norwegians coming after the fish.
Norppa, however, is not a common species in the Baltic Sea.
There's norps on the estate, he goes on.
Norppy lives, for example, in the Gulf Sea and the island Sea.
According to the South Australian court, the murdered pizzerianoist Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the night club.
Murdered South Australian pizzerianoist Robert Vallelonga.
In an interview with the court, Robert Vallelonga, a pizzerianoist, was aggressively acting against both his partner and security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers who accused him of killing Vallelonga requested that Adelaide's lower court release of his client's bail because it was "clearly" about self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep his client, whose identity has not been published, behind bars until the trial.
"The evidence was that the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the club," he said.
After that, the doll began, which led to this 40-year-old man who was dizzy -- tearing off the security man's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, death caused one blow, which clearly refers to self-defence or defence of the other.
A 25-year-old man is still being accused of murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconsciously near the intersection of Rundle St and Synagogue Place about 2nd of May 4th, he had serious head injuries.
He died in his injuries at the Royal Adelade Hospital the next day, and his friends and clients in Pizzeria were dying of the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
According to the prosecutors, there was no reason to engage in the killing, and after the case, he had told the taxi driver that he'd "stable someone to sleep for a few days".
But the security camera video now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and received his share of hard and violent behavior himself," he says.
On the side of our client there is both the presumption of innocence and the evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three security guards on the night of destruction had been involved in Vallelonga's behaviour.
According to them, other security officers didn't think he was threatening, because "he was short," and he used a large man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical exposure.
They said that the cab driver who had seen the case clearly would prove that Vallelonga was "stitched" and that he had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man to be arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
The controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan - based on the tradition - foreign news - the evening-Sanomat
A world of bad weather was expected to delay the start of a widespread, corrupt hunt.
The city of Taiji, Japan, again on Monday, began an annual hunting season for dolphins.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
A great deal of opposition to hunting from around the world is reported by British Journal Guardian.
In the yacht hunters, hundreds of dolphins drive into a remote bay ewe, where mammals are slaughtered after the most suitable individuals have been selected for transport to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The meat of the dolphins will also end up as food.
However, according to the local authorities, the start of hunting was expected to delay due to bad weather.
Information on the practice spread to the world in 2009 as a result of the documentary about The Cove.
In previous hunting periods, not only animal farmers but also diplomats have criticised the yachts.
According to the respondents, dolphin meat has a limited market in any case due to its high mercury content.
According to the Japanese government, these are those who defend hunting.
The parties have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
During the weekend, the dolphin hunt was opposed to a number of countries with demonstrations.
According to the protesters in Tokyo, the Japanese will damage the world’s reputation.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday before the Japanese Embassy.
Some NATO member states are uncertain about investing new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, views are divided into whether or not NATO should be set up in Eastern Europe and the Baltic as a response to the Ukrainian crisis, says the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have requested a military alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been opposed to the plan.
"Ukrainian has given a new perspective on Russia's policy and is threatening to bring European security down," told Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute of London.
NATO members will be gathered in the beginning of the week, and the military union will have to publish its new contingency plan.
The key issue of the plan is whether NATO can violate the Convention on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
There, the NATO and Warsaw alliance agree on how they invest in an area between the Atlantic and the Uralvuors.
In practice, the agreement prevents new military support points in Eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea according to the Financial Times.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually resign from the agreement.
In view of the tense situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"There must be a great deal of power in all NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, Chairman of the British Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller flying around the youngest world
When other teenagers learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned how to fly.
The 19 - year - old Guthmiller became the youngest around the world — and yet alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young person in the state of South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
On their way to Guthmiller was treated as a rock star thanks to their record performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"A little too risky" and "If you're scared, a rich kid just wants to see a little bit of the world and have fun".
Guthmiller did not have much to say to the commentators.
Of course, I had a lot of fun, but there was also a lot of work to do, and I hope that my record also encourages other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's flight was already early, and first he asked his parents to let him eat at the airport cafes.
Later, he insisted on getting to the flight class.
My parents let me go for a short, $20 flight of familiarity, 20 minutes, but I think they thought I'd stop feeling excited about it at the time.
He didn't stop.
Before long, Guthmiller entered into an agreement with his parents to give him more time in the chair.
I agreed to share a car with my father for the whole high school instead of getting my own car.
I could fly planes at the exchange store.
By 17 years, Guthmiller had received a flight licence and two years later he added a single-engineed Beechcraft flight for his single flight around the world.
A young man who was studying at MIT University was self-employed and made fuel calculations.
A lot of hours upgrading, he also meant that he himself needed extra surgery.
practically a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a few inventions completely during a long flight.
Flying into the cloud was both awesome and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries were not regulated to help them navigate him around the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane and which reached the height of 45,000 feet and would tear the plane apart.
Guthmiller's plane was not under pressure and was not equipped with oxygen, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
It would not have reached higher fuel levels.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died on a flight between American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his journey the hardest part.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Sulema, and he considers the rise phase to be technically challenging due to the high fuel needed for a 16-hour flight.
However, in spite of the risks and even the high level of the crime, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for ATK training through the Code.org website.
He himself is a coder, and founded his own company at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
I mean, it'd be great to start the next Apple, but let's see what happens.
In any case, Guthmiller intends to aim high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding a real French entrepreneur is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited to join his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after the Canadian W TV channel began to show the Cupcake Girls programme in 2009.
The inspiration continued until it became clear that one of the French entrepreneurs was not suitable for the task.
"My French entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that 100 of the potential customers are waiting outside the shop to buy a cup of cake, and he can't handle the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge wasted opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the selection process of the franchise partners, from the point of view of the company’s culture management skills rather than the stamping skills.
"Whoever can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he has held about a hundred interviews with each of the 11 French movements.
We start with six weeks of training, but the workers work completely differently in the working environment themselves, so the whole process is quite difficult. This is why training we stress above all the suitability for business culture.
Finding a real French entrepreneur is vital for the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader is able to modify and increase the organisation, while a poorly suitable leader can cause costly damage to the company.
"before I thought that finding a French entrepreneur would be like going on a date, but it's not true at all, you can do a lot to get to know each other before you get married," Joyce says.
On the other hand, in the case of a French partner, an agreement is signed, a guarantee is secured and a new store is built.
Taking a partnership with someone before seeing how a person works is a huge step and an important test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the French parties is similar to a strong marriage, because they have common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman and CEO of the Canadian French Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan believes that the French entrepreneur must also be careful when choosing the future French donor before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as human relationships: if a date partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he's married?" he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and assess future contractual partners and to pay attention to the smallest alarm marks on either side.
McLachlan adds that French donors like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, French donors must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the basis of a successful parent company, which challenges they have faced and the skills needed by the new French entrepreneur when faced with similar difficulties, the new franchise performers must decide.
For the first time, companies acting as French donors may also request the assistance of the French adviser to create a profile based on the practice of the sector.
McLachlan also reminds us that for the first time, French-entaries and entrepreneurs have a great deal of help on the CFA website at Lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will make it easier later because the French donors will learn to better assess potential entrepreneurs, but also because the first French entrepreneurs can give advice and help the evaluation.
"The work of the first French partner helped Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) in this creation," says Erik Church, Executive Director of O2E Brands. For example, companies belonging to the O2E Brands 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
The French entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't create alone, so the first French entrepreneurs must choose this idea in mind.
Under Church, there are 216 French entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a associate of You Move Me, Toronto franchise.
The Chruch method for finding a true franchise partner is simple.
"Is there any way that we can use our confidence test to ask yourself, "Do I invite this person to my weekend barbecue?" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day searching for solutions with them to major business challenges."
In addition, Church points out that the O2E Brands company is largely grateful to its French structure for its success.
In the company organisation, leaders often see their own position as short-term and lower-level management, while French entrepreneurs are taking part in a partnership with long-term goals and thus are more committed to the success of the company.
"There are much more good aspects of the French partnership than the traditional corporate structure, but the partnership is also much more intense", he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the vice-president and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but in a well-managed way it will produce better results.
Railway delays reduce cereal prices in the North of the United States
Delayed rail transport has led to a significant fall in cereals prices in the North of the United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put the transport network under new pressure.
Commercial cereals in the North Dakota state offer farmers only $ 2.7 from the bus chain - about a dollar less than the steering prices - the cost of ensuring the capacity of railways, traders and farming organisations say.
IN Raw materials
The most acute problems are the BNSF railways of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway and the Canadian Pacific railway.
The Federal Railway Supervisor will hold a hearing on Thursday on service problems.
The northern plains have to rely on railways for the transport of agricultural products, as they are far from river networks.
The delay in the carriage of trains increased as the high yield in 2013 followed a very cold winter resulting in a slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the transport of increased crude oil from North Dakota's Baker oil silage has replaced cereals transport, which is not the case according to railway companies.
According to a director of an international grain trade company, the costs of selling cereals and moving sellers to ensure the use of the train have risen from zero to up to $2,000 to $3,000 a year.
Somebody's gotta pay for it.
"These costs will be paid either by the farmer or by the customer," says the director of the grain trade company.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that the North Dakota Soya beans will grow by more than a third and 16% in the spring harvest.
Randy Gordon, chairman of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "normally we try to start a new harvest on a clean table, that is, enough storage space has been empty for the harvest and grain has been sold and transferred.
However, we are now late for the problems of last year's service.
The railway undertaking BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will manage the transport of this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, vice-president of BNSF, responsible for the transport of agricultural products, said that the company had reduced long-term transport (railway wagons ordered by customers to supply more than four days) from the beginning of April to 16 500, about two thousand.
"We've moved almost all the old crop we were supposed to carry," Miller says, referring to the last crop of grain left over.
However, the latest reported rates of BNSF cereals trains were 9 per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is 'unfair' but pointed out that the company is currently investing USD 5 billion in capital this year in order to improve the processing capacity of all types of products transported, such as cereals.
Due to the second measure, the trains of the Canadian Pacific railway company affected by the problems are 11 per cent lower than in the same year, but clearly higher than the high speeds of the initial year.
The Canadian Pacific railway undertaking has said to the railway supervisor (Surface Transport Board) that changes to its train order system should improve its ability to deal with traffic in the future season of 15-20 %.
"The Action Plan, which extends to the autumn of Canada's Pacific railway company, focuses on continuous improvement of trains' speed and efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more trains every week," said the railway company's representative.
Ukraine's crisis could solve NATO's "identity crisis"
Major country leaders, diplomats and experts have often been concerned about NATO's future and whether the end of NATO's Afghanistan mission also means the importance of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is reflected in the NATO summit in Wales this week, involving 60 leaders, including the US President Barack Obama.
On the agenda of politicians and diplomats there is no shortage of world crises, even to the extent that the exit of Afghan troops, which was previously a priority, is no longer the most important thing.
On the other hand, 28 states' alliances are needed after Russia has remounted Ukraine, and this is a shocking reminder that the threat of Europe's independence may not be just a part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also transfer troops, promise more money on defence expenditure and re-enact defence cooperation.
In some ways NATO is to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) looked for its purpose in some way -- and it was in the process of a rather significant identity crisis," says Heather Conley, Head of the European Programme for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but it has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to make world leaders a common strategy to defeat the military forces of the Islamic State that are rapidly becoming popular in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face major challenges in trying to inspire his fellow workers who are bored with the war to a military response, especially to one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy in which the extremists are won, once we have 'we do not have a strategy'.
Western experts have given the summit cautious expectations as to whether there will be breakthroughs in Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Further economic sanctions are planned as the main tool for the attack on Ukraine by Russia.
The officials of the European Union discussed this during the weekend, but postponed the decision on the new sanctions.
The U.S. officials pointed out that countries, from which Obama hopes the main partners in the Islamic problem, may not be members of NATO.
The accumulation of problems could not be anticipated two years ago, when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate ruled the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier Robert M. Gates used his final speech to say that the organization had almost achieved the point of "common military integrity".
American officials kept complaining that other countries could not achieve their financial goals.
NATO members promise to use 2% of their GDP for defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, Great Britain and the United States – achieved this objective last year.
Now, however, the officials of the White House say that they have noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff, where they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company had a genuine desire to see Member States tomorrow, the potential threats to their actual size.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 'the defence promises are more important and important than once after the end of the cold war', says Charles Kupchan, President of the US National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that agreement will be reached between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of his trip to strengthen his commitment to the defence cooperation in favour of Russia's worried neighbours.
The President will begin his three-day trip on a day-long visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of both Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula for itself this year, and NATO troops will be recycled regularly in Estonia when a new contingency plan published this week is being introduced.
The plan aims to shorten the time NATO needs to react to attacks in the border countries, the officials say.
The plan is to increase air surveillance and other visible signs of defence cooperation.
The changes pose a small risk for NATO, which abstained from establishing permanent support points for Russia as an expression of kindness to Eastern and Central Europe.
According to the officials, the new plan is not really a violation of the agreement, but it may also be a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who, in connection with the discussions, did not want his name to be made public before the official information.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, said the diplomat.
Is that what he's using to Ukraine?
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin has one ace in his sleeve with regard to Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of armed violence in eastern Ukraine and the sending of Russian troops to Ukraine's soil.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine has tightened, the Western countries are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a power card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main source of energy is Russia.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine’s primary sources of energy are natural gas (40 %) and coal (28 %), Geysar Gurbanov, which is active at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine in less than four months and coal mines are located in the east of the conflict, Ukrainians will be frozen when the gas supply from Russia is empty.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin win the war in the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine due to outstanding invoices on 16 July.
Earlier this month, Gazprom reported that Ukraine’s debt of gas was already EUR 5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think that no one will think of it anymore (tally) except for Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to facilitate this.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to supplement the stocks, we need to make necessary repairs and prepare for a cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat before separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Last month, Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company from Nomura, pointed out that Russia’s speeches on humanitarian issues and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be strengthened in a few months if Russia can maintain its activities until then.
In Moscow, it has already been reported that Ukraine will have to pay for future gas supplies in advance, unless the Kiova sector pays accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement allowing gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Jassenjuk said that Russia plans to stop gas supplies in the EU in the winter.
Later, Russian Minister for Energy, Alexander Novak, told us that the speeches were superfluous.
According to him, Russia will do its utmost to provide gas to EU countries.
The Liberal Sadibloggar got 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand cracks.
The Saudi Arabian court has held a ten-year imprisonment sentence for Raif Badaw, the founder of the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The judgment includes a further penalty of thousands of scaffolds and fines of about EUR 200 000 million.
The judgment was justified by the fact that he had set up an Islamic web site.
On Monday, the judge told AFP the other founder of the organization Suad al-Shamar.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was already sentenced in July 2013 to seven years in prison and 600 in midwives, but the judgment was sued and restored.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also commented on its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rantala's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the changing human encounters"
Madventures today published a new book World Explanation - An adventurer's explanation for everything.
We asked Riku Rantal for an explanation of the future of the world and the differences between the culture of India and Finland.
Riku also tells about the most important person she's ever met.
The writer, the journalist, the other party of Madventures, Riku Rantala, is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday was a movie student at the Civil Society and on Wednesday begins the second production season of Yllella Docventures.
Ever since the first day, he's been running from place to place.
I'm going to have a kid take from Maivar's in the morning to a day care home and a week's meeting.
The interview agreed on by the facet must be transferred to the telephone interview.
You won't have time.
In the midst of all the busy things he and Madventures on the other side, Tuna Miloff has had time to stop and write a World Explainment book, which is the book's cover, according to the cover of the book, the adventure manual for everything.
Anything?
Wow, a lot of promised.
The book discusses several themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is doing worse than the other, why we are here and who we are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book includes both prophets and fighters.
We worked on the book for about a year, Riku will tell IS by phone.
You've been barking a big piece of the book.
What is the main message of the work?
The need to know more about the world and the need to think about big questions is, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the East of the book is to be good for travel reading, but it is also meant at home to get people to discuss and share ideas.
The debate may even lead to action, Riku tells.
DESCRIPTION: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of your books is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We came to the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, we must believe that at some point we will make solutions to improve our situation.
The earth is a sort of alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, but only then can we change, Riku philosophio.
According to some studies, Western mankind has reached the top point of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This can help us to conclude that once we have enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money doesn't make you happy.
We want to raise people to discuss what is enough.
Using our natural resources will not be enough for long, Riku says.
You will also consider cultural differences in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
People don't stand out much.
Of course, the starting points for education, healthcare and hygiene are different.
The greatest cultural difference is that the Community's importance in India is far greater in terms of both good and bad.
When the Western worlds are wealthier, people live more alone.
Isolation in others and may result in loneliness and anxiety.
When we find a proper balance between sociality and loneliness, we'd be pretty close to happiness, Riku says.
There's been a lot of different people around the world.
What kind of human encounter has gotten into his mind best?
It is based on my childhood when I was with my family on the first big foreign trip.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was in the work of the UN.
I was seven years old and two smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby.
Home in Finland was hit by a big moving car.
We used to go to war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the road.
On the road, she walked by a girl my age carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big mercenary bench in the hand of a chef.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of your age realizes the situation.
It was one of the changing human encounters I'll always remember.
KUVA: Leena Koskela
Riku and Tuna at the book fair in 2013.
Then in Riku's "go to the cabbage", other people must be respected, even if they are significantly poorer or do not have the same living conditions as we do.
At that time, the breach realized that money could not be a human value gauge.
From the memories of adults, people in New Guinea will rise to the surface.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditionally people would live there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, not very much using money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
I thought about it.
And to think about it, he wants to get his new book readers with tunna, too.
The idea is for our book to inspire people to read, watch and listen to more.
To make people act like warm love for a conversation or even to a fistfight, Riku throws.
It's about the Kauhajoki magazine.
The events started when the couple arrived on a bus to the station and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi was on the move, the man on the yard threw a cab after something.
The driver got out of the car, the man who was a passenger.
A man who had thrown a male passenger into his head life-threateningly and left his hand and left the place.
The knife maker is a Danish, short-haired man, 170-75 cents tall.
According to the paper, there has been a young, white lady with a ponytail around the scene.
He's hoping to contact the police.
Police are also asking for clues from anyone who may have observed events or persons involved in the case.
It happened Wednesday, August 27th at 7:50 p.m.
"Moi!" said the brain to the brain... the world's first "patative" message passed through the Internet.
PLoS ONE has published an article that the international study group has managed to communicate the message directly to the mind.
The first messages through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. in Spanish and Italian "moi".
In the experiment, the electric brain curve of the sending test person was monitored.
The broadcaster was trained by means of a program to send bits, either hand or foot, by thinking about the movement.
The design of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands to number one.
This bit coded information was sent online to the recipient.
The recipient was caused by magnetic stimulation of the observation of each light injection per encoded bit.
The recipient was taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still a field of research in their children’s shoes, but believe that computerized telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Packages - Point - Earth Future
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also blackmailing its own sanctions.
There is a political need for packages.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia fought in Ukraine and occupied the Crimea.
In international politics, the reaction follows, act countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions are only long-term.
Iran was only able to engage in negotiations on its nuclear programme after years.
The South African Federation sat in place for decades, even though trade was prohibited by UN decisions.
There have also been sanctions against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to take top electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
The last time I saw him, we were frozen in the wood trade.
It is clear that sanctions will not be imposed on Russia's knees.
The Russians have been used to bad times and the disappearance of Violeta from the store is a panic.
When the EU intends to ban vodka imports from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians will drink to that vodka.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to take air support ships to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
Gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest harm to Russia is not to steal imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
The financial sector's limitations are the most detrimental.
They'll only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international loan market.
It needs to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take another one.
Although Russia has huge foreign reserves, they also cannot endure eternity.
The credit of Russian companies is huge and the money is expensive.
The banks of their own aren't able to fund them all.
You have to weigh more money, or there will be payment difficulties for companies.
The bankruptcys are also competitions in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis persists for years, Russia's modernisation will stop, such as the Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsinki's Words.
It wouldn't be the first time.
At least Russia would once again return to Russia and get in the way.
In North Korea an exceptional free-pee event was held
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed the international free match held in Pjongjangjang, the capital city on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, a Japanese lawyer who became a free wrestler, took part in the event from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free matches, taekwondo matches were also seen among local athletes.
According to Inok, the goal of the event was, through sport, to bring conflicting states closer and to promote world peace.
In their speeches, the politicians called for improvements between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of the Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, in turn, promised to reopen the investigation into these cases.
Last international free movement was seen in North Korea in 1995.
SOK reduces approximately 110 persons from the trade organization.
The Yt negotiations began in June, with a maximum reduction of 130.
According to the company, its organisation has now been dismantled for overlapping activities and its responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK says that it is applying for more cost-efficiency and synergies between different sectors of activity.
In addition to the economic downturn and the fall in consumer demand, there is a structural change in trade, which has hit trade, particularly in commodity trade.
The result of the S-group's commodity trade has been a loss for some time now.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and managers of SOK's use and day-to-day assets trade, i.e. a total of 530 persons.
Turun Sanomat: Part of self-medications behind the counter
According to the paper, there are more medicines coming between prescription medicines and medicines that you can take from the shelf life that you can take without a prescription, but only after you have been advised by your pharmacist.
According to the Finnish Federation, for example, eye drops containing antibiotics could be consulted.
After an interview with a farmer or a pharmacist and in meeting pre-defined criteria, the drug should be given at the counter, reflecting on the President of the Federation Kirsi Kvarnström in Turku's words.
In Finland, we already have a few prescriptions, but a medicine that requires advice.
One of these is a follow-up product.
It's a more specific cause of corruption.
Finland pays more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed at the small number of lax cases and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice's working party will consider the need for criminal law to ensure the trade in influence and abuse.
The differences in legislation were highlighted, for example, during the trial of Patria’s lush case in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
The trade in influence in Slovenia brought two years' imprisonment to the former Prime Minister, but the Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal title.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has intensified its cooperation, as required by the Government Programme.
According to the completed survey, there is little study of the donation in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vasaa and the University of Police and on corruption in various fields.
Messi possee navigability - Sports - Karjalainen
Captain Lionel Messi of the Argentine football team will be left out of the midnight country match against Germany.
The fair keeps the view on the side of the nipple, told him his company in Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona keeps Mess on the side as a precaution.
The Messiah was offended by the navigator on Sunday's league against Villareal.
Barcelona won the match at 1-0.
The Messiah also missed a charity match in Rome.
Mr. Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he's going to get the tuurners to fight the Asian Champions League to Korea
Tony Popovic is missing three key players in Korea.
Many of the players in the Western Sydney Wanderers team are in the game ban in the first game, and Coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players at the Asian Championships League witch base FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai's 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendly matches at Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal match to be held on 17 September.
Due to excessive yellow cards Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole skip the Korean trip, but Coach Popovic believes in their fans.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players at ACL for us", Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
After all, no players should be gone, but we did not have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever's gonna replace him, he's probably done a lot of work, and I'm totally counting on the whole team.
I'm not afraid to just play against who in semifinals.
The Wanderers also have to be without Spiranovich, which is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The defender of The Socceroos was injured before the season began, but has continued running, and it is possible that he will play back at Pirtek Stadium on October 1st.
"He's back in the career and he's gonna be fine," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and leaves with us in Dubai, which is an excellent news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's been practicing a couple of times out there, which is good.
It'll take a while before he's all right, but he'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has the world's top-class facilities at Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic believes that the trip to Dubai is also a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after major changes in the end of the last season.
"We know this will help players to create ties," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better, both on the ground and outside.
So we're using the camp for a lot of purposes.
Three times the employee's monthly salary is paid by Elit's burger.
01.09.2014 21:18 North Korea can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if it happens to be part of the country’s elite.
The financial Times tells us about the opposites of the economy.
In North Korea, unofficial markets may flourish more than ever.
They provide a luxury for wealthy or saving ordinary citizens, which has not been used to uniting with the dictatorship state.
Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: a pleasure center where a mere ticket costs up to ten months of regular employee's salary.
You're gonna get some burgers in place that cost $76.
It's three to five months' pay for the usual duunar in the country.
In the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea's "Women market" began in the 1990s when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies can at worst be gross.
Still, in Pjongyang, many have a mobile phone with an ovh of $200.
Part of the reason may be the ruler of Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create a self-evolving and youthful image.
In his day, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the ground’s dwindling.

Ormisto House: Stormont Council's wishful sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer for Ormisto House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers nearly 3 000 pounds a week.
The Council bought a building in the eastern part of the city from the 1800s 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The Council failed to sell the building further, when the security and maintenance of the building came to pay the Council some £400 a day.
The building was sold at a rate of 1,25 million pounds.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought a building in Class B with a historical value of £9 million in 2001, because it needed more office space.
Later, however, it was found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was re-saled at a price of GBP 2.5 million this time.
The building was not sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbit of the Ulster Union suggested that Ormiton House be set up for a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that there are negotiations on the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner as soon as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate agent will remain silent about the identity and sales price of the buyer.
The weekly safety and repair costs of Ormisto House are about 3 000 pounds.
The Council bought a building from the police forces ahead of Northern Ireland Police Board.
By the beginning of this year, the cost of security at Ormisto House was 885 641 pounds and maintenance costs of 371 379.
The price of professional services related to repair and maintenance was 250 015 pounds and the fees for development and design professionals were 212 466 pounds.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when he purchased William Pirrie, a partner of Harland. Pirri then became Chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after the death of Lord Pirri, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. In 1928, the company sold it to Campbell College, which held it until the mid 70s.
"Principality is growing": Helsinki intends to reduce school attendance
There's no saving, says JHL.
Helsinki is preparing a radical reduction in the number of school-specific students.
The reduction would not concern a child’s personal assistant.
The Helsinki educational board decided to present a total of about 2.7 million karsts of educational support resources in the spring.
In Helsinki, there are around 600 students.
If the contractions occur, they shall enter into force immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the decision increases inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is regrettable that aiders must be reduced for easy reasons of savings because the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined in the law.
There is certainly no need for savings, on the contrary, the working burden of the teaching staff is increasing.
For schoolchildren, savings are a greater risk of falling from learning objectives and the ability to share teachers is hard, emphasising JHL’s director of industry Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki do not discriminate because small schools and students need support will no longer receive assistant resources at all.
The aim of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
The income prevention work is being done by trainees.
However, the adaptation measures of the Education Agency are directed mainly at this group.
In the future, all parties will suffer from this.
In autumn, the Helsinki City Council will make the final solution to the resources, to which I hope the vision and wisdom to look far into the future and to act in accordance with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel takes control of the land on the West Bank
The women of Israel are walking in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot in Etzion, near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel occupied nearly 400 hectares of land in the Jewish settlement area of the West Bank near Bethlehem. This may be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, while threatening the Palestinians’ request not to build more settlements and threaten the general public opinion of the world.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposed the expansion of the West Coast authorities, felt that Sunday events could be the biggest single country in the West Bank for decades and could "make a dramatic change to the situation in the region".
The Palestinians aim to establish their own country for countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the situation in the countryside became a political nightmare after the three Israelis were kidnapped and killed in June after they were picked up in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of devastation implies that it was meant to be a sort of compensation for the population of the settlement and punishment for the Palestinian people.
As close to the Jewish Gevaot institution in the district of Etzion, South Jerusalem, the land has now been officially declared a "state country" when it was previously privately owned by the Palestinians, a necessary step is needed to allow Israel to start planning buildings.
However, the mayor of Surif, the nearby Palestinian city, Ahmad Lafi, said that the country belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news office WAFA that the Israeli army and its personnel published early Sunday regulations in which Israel announced that they would take over the olive and other trees of Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections shall be made within 45 days.
The young kidnapping was carried out by the Israeli army in the West Bank by a group of Muslims ruling Gaza against Hamas, who Israel said had been behind the kidnappings.
The subsequent tensions on the border between Israel and Gaza reached a war lasting 50 days, which ended last week in Egypt.
It has quickly drawn attention to the Israeli regime of the West Bank and has revealed conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government which make Israel and Palestine more difficult to develop.
Lapland’s crisis municipalities are usually multi-problemed
A growing part of Lapland’s municipalities is in trouble, as is reflected in a welfare study prepared by the University of Lapland and the University of Applied Sciences of Lapland.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the Professor, a billion euros are not enough to reduce the municipalities' responsibilities.
The common features of crises include weak municipal economy, poor employment and migration losses.
According to the University of Lapland’s Emeritus Professor Asko Suikkasen, new crisis municipalities are coming from the western border and from East Lap.
In the survey survey, residents estimate the situation of the municipality in a rather realistic way.
Even pessimisticly, the inhabitants of the well - maintained municipalities were looking into the visions.
It's a lot of food that's been hit by intense expectations.
People hope that the present daily daily daily life and well-being will remain, perhaps even a little better.
In this time there is no dare to think about longer-term investments such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The research team surprised the big differences between municipalities.
For example, the cost of income support per capita varies from a couple of tens to over one hundred euros.
The income per capita ranges from two thousand euros in Ranua to 4400 euros in Pelkosenniemi.
According to the journey, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How much money is spent on obtaining state contributions and what is the degree of debt, varies much from one country in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close borders from returning Islamic fighters
The United Kingdom may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters who left Iraq and Syria from their homeland.
BBC reports about the matter, referring to government sources.
However, according to the BBC, the British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to retain their nationality.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals that will be considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is to present it.
The government is also looking for ways in which it could make it more difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way is to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily seize the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr welcomes the immediate release of Australian attorney Melinda Taylor from the liberal prison.
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a liberal prison today.
The Federal Government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
The representative of Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "all will go well" and the lawyer of the International Criminal Court will be released to the Australian authorities tonight, after which he will rise to Europe by midnight.
"We are happy with the news that he is likely to be released today," the representative commented to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanked the wider international community for assistance and support, the representative said.
Taylor's probably flying to Rome before the journey to her home in the Hague.
On 7 June in the city of Zintani, where they represented the son of Seif al-Islam, the former dictator of Libya, Muammar Gaddaf.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took out documents for Seif, which, in their opinion, threatened national security.
Senator Carr has seen a lot of effort to free Taylor, including traveling to the capital of Libya last month to run this matter.
Taylor couldn't talk to her husband or her little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a brief call to his home in the Hague shortly after the visit of the Australian ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with his parents, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally given access to the phone.
Taylor's parents had appealed to Libya for his daughter's release before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other lawyers from the criminal court are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
A week ago, Carr reported that the debate between a lawyer who was released in The Hague and the authorities in Libya "the Court's lawyer was sorry and apologized for possible misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of any mistakes, but has promised to examine in depth the actions of its team once its members have returned home.
"As a result of its ruling by the International Criminal Court, it must ensure that everyone who has acted incorrectly is sentenced to justice", the Court announced in its notification last month.
The International Criminal Court is calling for a trial for 39-year-old Seif al-Islam against humanity during his father's administrative period, which suddenly ended last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local, and on 1 May he had taken an initiative, in which he announced that he would not accept the decision of the judge's lawyer to hold the trial in The Hague.
Youngcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took his second victory at the early stages of the Spanish football league, but easy did not fall at Villarreal's home.
The blue-red masked their heads on the Villarreal guard Sergio Asensoon until the 82th minute finally succeeded.
The winner of the victory was a surprising man: 19 years old, the attacker Sandro Ramirez made at La Liga only 12 minutes earlier.

The gatherings with the Ferguson police ended mysteriously after the $433,000 crossing.
High-level officers closed two online collection sites without an explanation this weekend for more than $400,000 collected by websites to a police officer who shot an unarmoured 18-year-old Ferguson in Missouri State.
Two separate pages on the GoFundMe website open to the general public, bearing similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have collected 235 750 dollars and 197 620 dollars for the Ferguson police who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site run by Brown's family attorney had been collected after $314 099 Sunday afternoon.
The shootings followed the unrest of many weeks ago and the demonstrations mostly against the close white police forces of Ferguson, the blacks, who forced Wilson to hide while local and federal research tried to determine if Brown was shot without cause.
Network collection campaigns have given rise to some attention to the defence of Wilson, especially since some of the visitors had written a comment on racist comments that have since been removed.
Apparently, both pages stopped receiving donations at the same time on Saturday, and the sitekeepers gave no reason to do so.
When trying to give a donation on the page, he sees a message saying, "We don't take any hits anymore!
The organiser has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, the representative of the GoFundMe website provided the Los Angeles Times with a notice stating that the site did not prevent donations from being given.
"Every organiser of the GoFundMe campaign will decide for themselves when he wants to stop receiving donations", Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website said when he announced.
The organisers may also wish to continue receiving donations later.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a return of $ 197,620, is maintained by a charity team composed of policemen in St. Louis, Shield of Hope, who is a recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
Three police officers, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, were not responding to e-mails on Sunday asking for more information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official informant at the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a close-up member of the City Council of Florissant and a member of the Roorda Missour House.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected 235 750 dollars. He has not been confirmed as the recipient of donations approved by the site.
However, the representative of the GoFundMe website assured the Times that there is an anonymous charity.
Only little information has been provided to donors about the anonymous charity of the collection campaign, unlike those who maintain another Wilson page or Brown website.
Two weeks ago, the anonymous Wilson-page benefactor wrote a message to visitors that the site cooperates with the Shield of Hope group in order to become an official host of donations.
Approval has not yet been granted.
The welfare provider provided additional information to visitors who wanted to visit Gmail e-mail address, which is a alias, but did not respond immediately to the request for additional information on Sunday.
In his announcement to The Times, the representative of the GoFundMe page said that the anonymous collection page was removed from the search results of the main website and added that "this campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe website that a functional Facebook account should be used".
In the information security practices of the GoFundMe website, users are urged to "stamp only GoFundMe users who know and trust in personally".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection site published on the GoFundMe website is accurate and honest.
According to Mr Little, however, GoFundMe has been in contact with the campaign organiser and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe can also arrest all the funds collected if it is necessary to start studies in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to seize the funds collected by this campaign.
Popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organized campaigns that support Wilson, told the followers of the site this weekend that lawyers are trying to find a "explain", why donors of the GoFundMe website have been prevented from giving up, but the page did not provide any further information.
The Facebook site also has an anonymous administrator, and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
