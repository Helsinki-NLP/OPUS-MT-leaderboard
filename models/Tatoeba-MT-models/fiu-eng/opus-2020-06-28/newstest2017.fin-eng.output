A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
The 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco found dead at the local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and he says, "His business finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall shopping mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, San Francisco's medical examiner's office.
San Francisco Police Department said death was identified as a homicide, and the investigation is ongoing.
Brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line shock in Boston, had received his dream job as head of the Sanfranciscoan Sons & Daughters restaurant’ line kitchen engineer six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they are "sacred and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team working like a tight family, and they're gonna miss him very much," the representative said.
We send our thoughts and expressions of grief to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was at the beginning of the night, but that recently "his things were going well at last".
"He found the apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was a benefactor, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling cohesion with the family was to make us food, make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of disputes.
He was a brother who drove along with the power.
"In the world, where so many things are wrong, he was an unbroken diamond, which was brighter every day," he said.
All those with information on this issue will be invited to call San Francisco Police Station's lead line number 415-575-444.
Medical trainees strike: Requirements for new measures to combat work
The representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to adopt new measures to combat work in their dispute concerning the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) invites the whole Council to support new measures to combat work from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to grasp concerns about the agreement.
In July, doctors and medical students voted to reject the agreement that had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In his letter to the JDC President Ellen McCourt, who was released on Thursday night through Twitter, said that the government had kept "sufficiently quiet" issues that he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject fully the proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to obtaining a mandate for a progressive and expanding work fight programme starting early in September.
The dispute has been followed by the participation of medical practitioners in the sixth strike this year, including the first complete job stop in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA's medical practitioners, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the agreement had been rejected, the conditions recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be imposed on British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: external association?
Ele, who ended up in a crisis.
On Tuesday, Russian and Turkish leaders met each other in order to declare the fight against eight months of words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that there was more desire for this reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, the occasion was served.
But Putin’s smile looked violent, and he hardly threatened heat, even according to his own calm standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyp Erdogan kept talking about his "loved friend" Putin five times, according to a report.
I lost my mind on the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the level before the crisis, but even to the better.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan as acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal was a reflection of the opposite.
However, the Viking of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
The Moscow reaction at that time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankar because it stabbed Moscow in the back.
The accident was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild real confidence, perhaps impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led to a shocking, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious allegations of high officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by Isis.
He's strongly denied this.
But the official message in Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of ankara's settlement are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost out of control in the failed coup last month.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
In addition, there is an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been severe, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast annually.
The figure has decreased by nearly 90 per cent.
As regards Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights are finally continuing.
They're hoping for a late season to raid the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
"You went there, you tomatoed back here," as was formulated in the report by the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit also had political added value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West about what is considered weak in response to an attempted coup of power.
When it is added to the long-term challenge of the progressive EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is eager to make use of coolness and undermine Turkish ties to Western countries, will emerge.
The Russian leader certainly got a break from Ankar where he called after the revolution to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is an account for Moscow, which has its own deep - rooted fear of power.
So this meeting in the prame seaports made it possible for Russia and Turkey to "outside association", as an analyst described the situation to me: two countries that experienced the rejection of them and mishandled them, combining their forces.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be a lot of warning that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question regarding their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on what they can look for in common with Syria.
After months of open hostility, and considering the possibility of a full-fledged disaster, when a member of NATO is shot down by Turkey, it is certainly better that two leaders are back in the talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to save it, it has abandoned these objectives.
The bank’s strategies have now used the ‘RBS’ product brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of international sport sponsoring, Six Nations Rugby's Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it's considered right to let the national brands come to the front.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it is not re-started.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except the main office and listed stock exchanges are converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a round of clients and staff at Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investor brand and the employer of our employees, because we will now become much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of the different brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It is now time for us to move towards the brand bank, because basically (we have been asked) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynic if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work that we have done as a focus on the needs of our customers, we do not have our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3000 victory
A detector sprays champagne after a double victory with a total of 3000 winnings
The Slayer Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved a milestone at the second victory of the evening in his home course, competing with John Gosden’s coaching at Predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is a sixth jockey who achieves this postponing race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time master jockey Dettori, who won earlier at Ghayyaar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20 000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Detor absorbs the charms of himself as he restores Predilection after victory.
Two contestants have reached this formal obstacle competition... master jockey Richard Johnson... and retired 20 times champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had record in his broken career of over 4300 victory.
Lester Piggott, 9 times Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best competitors in today’s age, and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone, which only a few have achieved before him.
She's elegant and strong, but she's got a tactical nerve to fire her in the other weighing room.
He's a great ambassador to competitions, his passion and charisma have been pulling fans of the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have rode 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and a big race jockey!
With serious talk, Frankie has been riding winners in Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person who's a good thing for British competition, but besides that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a flying plane landing to the freighter.
Flying off to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of the British race for two decades.
It's been a mountain range.
A lot of winnings in big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the aircraft accident and suffered a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he was difficult to begin with when he returned after six months of competition ban, but he showed significant characterity in challenging suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - the Dator has said in the past that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin distinguishes Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanovin
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has suddenly distinguished Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted interior for many years.
The 63-year-old is now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin opinion said that Putin 's set Ivanov to move away from the functions of the Head of the Russian presidential administration', but there was no reason to do so.
Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MEGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President's protocol and government staff, said on the Kreml's website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards the design of laws and the management of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave the place and recommended that Vaino should be appointed to his position.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and, like Putin, the Soviet security service was in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting on state television with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew from his own request.
But despite smiling at cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the elections.
So this is just some kind of power struggle after all?
No one yet knows.
But the formal argument that a man once promoted to become a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with great doubt.
In his comments to Putin, Ivanov, in his comments on the Kremlin website, said: "It is true that early in 2012, I asked you in the debate to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, perhaps even to say a job, a job.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service in FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Once it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Puti after the second period, because Putin's third season would have been against the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another ally in Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
The Prime Minister of Putin became president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got the shoe when he hit the producer
Gibson was involved last month in a physical dispute at the scene of the show in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, informed him of his separation in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner presented his apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the description site.
I regret that happened," he said in his statement.
According to the statement of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's figure is removed from the series of FBI agents will be expected later.
The 54-year-old who previously played Dharma & Greg’s state-of-the-art history has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped I'd come all the way, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible working group and, above all, the best fans on the show.
The beginning of a series of twelve production periods has been planned for September 28.
The mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff.
The man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windmills left behind by a waterbow.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material on the revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The 1.35 billionth project is now expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossing site, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four closes between the "false threats" which are now preparing for the bridge around each of the three pillars.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It's got 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 treble.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building Queensferry's crossing site.
We are all proving a truly impressive engineering work in this project, using over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a demanding operation in which the extreme precise dimensions should be agreed.
All in all, nearly 79% of the bridge is now in place and the final part of the deck is lying in your concrete today at Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be brought to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
This fantastic project represents the top of building technology.
After the last section of the road road was installed and combined with an expanding North Pole road, we then had to close the remaining part to the north, i.e. to the inland side.
This was done by drawing 700 millimetres south of the northern road bridge.
This was a huge and very demanding measure at the same time.
It is huge, since it is 222 meters long, it weighs about 6000 tonnes and has to be drawn at about 3% slope angle.
The demanding, since the tolerances allowed, according to which the team worked, were small, were only a few millimetres in each direction.
I'm glad everything went well though.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "lucky when they're alive" after they fell off their fishing boat outside Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat was alarmed at 1.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop on the Moelfre Bay Bay Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to secure their ships as they moved on to themselves.
"We saw the boat orbiting closer to men and imagined the worst", said Vince Jones, the poet of Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By luck, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got on the move," he added.
A local fishing boat saved two of the men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging out of the boys without a lifeline.
The men were taken to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: "These three men in water are lucky when they are alive and completely unharmed.
The boat was powered by a trapping machine, but it had somehow removed the boat from its time when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is respectable for hunting health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their spare time watching the evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people rise up from the couch and participate in some kind of activity.
The display time was initially set on television, then on video games and now on smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and air activity don't turn each other off.
I am, of course, referring to the wildness of Pokémon Go. The application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later was created as a drawing series, playing cards and other follow-up products).
As many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity had somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as huge favors for overloaded servers.
Only in the days of Pokémon Golla had more users than on Tinder and almost as much as on Twitter.
So how does it work?
In the nutshell, explained by players using their smartphone while looking for Pokémons, which are traced by GPS, can be "lighted" (by means of a remote phone) or "stamped" after discovery.
The generation who played the game younger has joined the wild beast and jumped up on the couch according to the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of "medium-percentage".
The Apple Watch app, which follows 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of users following the Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees training levels.
Many public health campaigns called for "find 30", "a rise from the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because the majority of public health warnings are boring and are transmitted by people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of mobility cannot be reduced.
Regularly mobile people are at a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse for this list.
The beauty of Pokémon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even get to hunt new friends.
As usual, ridiculers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk toward the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were applications like Fitzbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The alarm will disappear and the use will fall in due time.
However, Pokémon’s success will result in other games that combine applications and virtual reality with the activity of the real world, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better condition and healthy.

Simone Bales caught gold in women's gymnastics multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity thing.
Simone Bales is immune to everything.
The energy in the jump.
It's a suffocating boom.
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.
Excellent everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast achieved a polygamous championship on Thursday, leaving a gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic light play.
His total point, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver medalist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian prossimist Aliya Mustafina.
At the United States Simone Bales’ balance sheet in the finals of women’s multiplication in summer Olympics in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman who has successively won the championship of the multi-stakeholder, and the fifth American champion in all. At the same time he strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps the best for all time.
He broke into tears when his final points were announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement will increase his class with the best athletes of other generations, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Bales has ruled his species for the last three years, winning 15 World Cups, including 10 Gold, through programmes with so amazing a mix of ambition and accuracy that the Olympic champion of 1984, Mary Lou Retton, called him "the best person to see him as a gymnast".
The last experiment was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between the Bales and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Return home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
The United States Simone Bales, on the left, and Aly Raisman hugs the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the finals of women's artificial gymnastics in the summer Olympics in Brazil Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, August.
Bales reached the first medal on Tuesday when he was active at the launch party of the national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Bales claimed that he had never thought about the future as he walked to the top of the knowledge, it is not entirely true.
Some of his permanto program - one of his brand's extremism - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit the street next to the Olympics in Rio.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl whose grandparents adopted as a taperon, whose coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on a study trip at the gym where Boorman trained has become a power factor.
He has not lost in the multi-stakeholder since summer 2013, and this victory will continue as long as Bales wants.
Even though Mustafina was in control after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance and permanence, where Bales is the dominant world champion, were waiting.
He rose at top point 15.433 and exceeded by receiving 15.933 permango.
Raisman sought him in a good way when they waited for the final points, just the formation and tears rose into the eyes of the Bales glitter red, white, and blue, when he once wrote his playbook, the dream of which he was true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of revantage from four years ago when he was divided into a third position, but lost the pronto Mustafina in the refurbishment.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "Isomother", was clearly in charge.
He sent flying kisses to the public after his blow-off at the emotional risk of returning, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Bales is concerned, this widespread twist of 19 years ago from this week will give a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims of serial murder were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women died in the most deadly attack of Phoenix's first serial killer in the last decade, and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, and this was what was reported in the police release on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on 12 June.
The report reports that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired up to eight times and then fled by another means of transport.
According to the police, triple death doesn't seem to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take the purses or the other adult victim's $900.
Officer of Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that the shooting involved researchers to see if it was connected to four previous attacks.
All seven people have died and two wounded in nine attacks during the four months, mainly in two parts of Latin America.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home", Howard said earlier this month to CBS's subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several means of transport, such as the brown Nissan at the end of the 1990s, the black BMW at the end of the 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and that the same killer had done.
Ellis, 33, had to go to a hospital where he died later due to his injuries.
Liner, 31, as well as Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the death of a triangular death, aimed at an empty open van, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet seals, bullet seat and bullet fragments in engine space.
Mother 6-year-old with microkefal: "Tilanne gets easier"
Edmund Picciut, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is a small-headed one, a result of the genetic disorder his mother Elizabeth Picciut did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
To him and his husband, Vincent, was told that Edmund may never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that "I didn't know people were still doing it," Piccito explained.
Edmund walks with his walks.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was only three years old, and he still won't talk.
But he's slowly reaching out to some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth's showing me how the signs that Edmund's inventions have made are "draw me".
"We'll teach him sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language. He tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own lines.
Microkefal may be due to a wide range of reasons: genetics such as Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as ash or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too soon to say how it affects the lives of those who have received Zika.
Piccito remembers the emotional load caused by the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prediction in a long time because I don't expect anyone to actually give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have birth defects from Zika.
It'll get better.
You can believe things will get better.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The heavy rains and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
In Louisiana, the governor was able to declare the emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected for the state on Saturday.
National Weather Service reports that many rivers in the south of Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their nerves and caused a widespread flooding due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, the governor's office representative for security and emergency situations, said they will receive requests for recovery water vehicles, boats and sandheads.
Steele said that the only county in Tangipahoa asked for tens of thousands of sands.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday, in a large part of the south of Louisiana.
In the opinion, the weather service said that three or five cents more rain would be expected for the region.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was valid on Friday when rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River, near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set an flood record during the weekend.
The weatherman Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is lower than the flooding of the Ascension District along the river, when flooding rivers slowly fall into Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state of Mississippi, in Liverpool, south of Lousiana, was the highest level of all time on Friday morning at nine o'clock.
Saviors still picked people up from flood water in the districts of Amiste and Wilkinson in the south of Mississip.
On Friday, Leroy Hansford and his wife and boyfriend were near Glosster among the saved ones.
Hansford, a 62-year-old, says that normally over 400 feet at a distance from his house, Beaver Creek’s water rose rapidly during the night.
He says he was warned by another, close-up boyfriend.
"We woke up, and the water continued to rise," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen the stream of water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both her family and her family have injuries, and that she is the only swimmer.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved three in a big, military-style truck and took them to the Glooster fire station where the rescueds spent their nights on Friday.
Mr Krautmann says that "they are fast to go on" during heavy rains and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reported hundreds of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Mr Krautmann said that the country had been completely tired of the heavy rain since the middle week.
The flooding of beaches and streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of Tangipahoa county from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five schools, the authorities told.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the City Council in Tangipahoa said that 200 homes had been flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under fire.
The district president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had been caught in the wake water.
Amis and Hammond cities have opened shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They can get back to their homes when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangipahoa, twenty streets were closed because of rising water, and the inhabitants were able to collect sands to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last great flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city administration.
There's a similar case coming from here.
In Mississip, the emergency director of Harrison County, Mr. Ruby Lacy, said that a flat rain continued along the Gulf coast.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported flooded, but so far no flood cases have been reported.
Keith Townson, director of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and the rain continues."
"Today bullets" was six years old Majah Brown survives the shooting of Philadelphia
Police say that six-year-old boys have been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name Majah Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown had several gunshot wounds, including nivus, foot, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was moved to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, her little body was full of bullets," the son's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical, and he has been undergoing multiple surgery.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first class at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot at the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable state according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot from the front seat of the car in conjunction with a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting the position.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are looking into whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
The researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that there seems to have been a cross between several shooters.
The type of seals that came from various weapons of attack filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were seals on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in an active battle", the chief of police in Philadelphia, Anthony Ginaaldi, told the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance footage of the camera.
Another six-year-old girl, got hit by a delusion on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That is why I invite this year's women's Olympic gymnast team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, will be all proud.
This team looks, eventually, from America.
It has also established the presence of women in the dark and Latin Americas at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful female fighter has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as a Olympic winner, and America was cheering.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but masterly gymnastic gymnastics programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American woman who has successively won an individual cult in women's cartoons.
And his teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation doesn't look like this in gymnastic halls all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all traveled the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They're "Final Five" (last five), because the next Olympic gymnastic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a expensive species, and gymnastics tend to practice in private gymnasiums, which are maintained by parents who pay training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coachers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
The vast majority of these gymnasties are located in prosperous suburbs, which can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnastics receive all their training, and this is a costly and long-term commitment to the families of the gymnastics.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Bales coach, and Maggie Haley, the Coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they began the gymnast.
We need to bring more cost-effective and available gymnastic training to communities where many young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurel live.
I set up my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15 000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-level gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic species.
The powers, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the hardness, discipline and determination of the mind, are developed by the gymnasts.
This combination offers life-long benefits for good health and for school and work.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start to develop a gymnastic spirit, and it's awesome.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for showing serious attention to the "girl power" by winning the Olympic team bull, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to begin on the road towards healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Doctoral interns organising new strikes after leaving Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an enhanced agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of 37 000 doctoral practitioners who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans for coercion, saying that NHS was on "unknown soil", and that even small additional delays harm staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend working hours to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Medical Practitioner Committee, said last night in the opinion: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it accelerates the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors fairly."
While only eight weeks are left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA’s companies have faced the government’s lack of willingness to participate and, at times, a deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he does not do so, medical practitioners will be prepared to continue working fighting.
The last strike at the end of April meant the delay of almost 13,000 routine surgery and 100 000 receptioners when nurses and consultants were recruited to act as doctors in the strike.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an enhanced agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 doctors under the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, called on doctors to avoid breaking down.
Mortimer said: "The fights achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on the teams and services that are already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety and disturbances to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the last two months, we have been discussing with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and Others, we have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of surveillance (Guardian role) and phenomena (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training to return from the Sabbath, costs of education, mutual recognition of the educational programme, freedom of study and gender pay gap in medicine - will be a sign of the seriousness of the employer, the Health Education England training organisation and of the Ministry of Health of Health respect for the agreements reached with the Marras, Helm and May with the BMA.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are taking two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans longer.
The medicine used to prevent blood clotting, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
This medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another seizure.
NHS overseer NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS overseer, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and one in four of them gets a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to a fat substance accumulated in the wall of the artery, which is formed by a clotum.
If you have a tear in your throat, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the circulation in your heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can go with the blood and break the blood circulation into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, is manufactured by a British company, and sold by Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The NICE draft guidance document published today recommends that 90 mg of ticagrelor be administered to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of effective treatment to prevent progression, even a quarter of the people who received a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, whose consequences are often devastating."
Fear of a return can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of later heart attacks and strokes in people with a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since the data on efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited over a period of more than three years, no longer treatment is recommended in the draft guidance document than during this period.
The culture of political correctness allows the electoral field to flourish in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving the government's report a blow.
The culture of political correctness has resulted in the widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, and today the report of a shocking government is being published.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles sets up police, election officials and city councils for ignoring the evidence of the electoral power because of the oversensitiveness of race and religion.
The former Secretary of the Community, the current emperor of corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to place security chains in order to protect those who are afraid of voting places.
He recommends that voters present their identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the finger of the voter should be placed on an unscathed skin so that no one can vote twice.
I think we should better protect the spreaders, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have wider access to delegation documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working group.
"This would not only protect the electoral power, but would protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the electoral power," he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the voting scandal of the East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed as a result of the accusations of a number of acts of corruption and illegality.
The court stated that Rahman’s "unfortunately distorted" Muslim community had religious feelings and had silenced his critic’s accusations of racism and Islam.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious obligation of loyal Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were convincing or the result that a person will vote as another speaker.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of the whistle in the whole country.
He expressed his particular concern at the vote of the election party by post, where members of the high-value Muslim community were said to pressure people to vote on the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including identification by ID card
He said in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the parents' will, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"We were concerned that... the state institutions had ignored such behavior because of the 'politically correct' racial and religious over sensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 suggestions for cleaning the system, including banning political activists to deal with the voting flags that came into the mail so that the "sounding vote" would end.
The report by Mrs May also calls for more stringent amendments to the registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register in immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options to prove the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person voting the unscathed, so that no one can vote twice.
Run systematic nationalisation checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail vote.
To prevent political activists from handling the sounds and envelopes that come through the mail and the votes in which the votes are sent.
Let the police set up security chains around voting positions.
Change the law so that it will be easier to accuse people of scaring on the basis of the Representative of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at the polls.
He insisted that only English (except Wales) is used in voting places.
Strengthen training in order to ensure that staff stick to the rule that the voter should be caught alone.
Sir Eric will take over the Great London police force, saying that it's "a little bit of a shame" after the case of Tower Hamlets.
"The Election Court remained as a result of the numerous acts of corruption and illegality of Lutfur Rahman and his official", he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds, without doubt, according to the criminal law display threshold.
He also criticised the inefficient "stampling check" of city councils at the polling offices.
Sir Eric said, "We had the Tower Hamlets judgment last year was a wake-up.
Our nation has a brilliant heritage as a source of parliaments, but this worrying and smuggled spread of the election market and the prohibition of certain groups' facts threaten this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's bicyclist double solo and other famous pictures at the Olympics in Rio
This week’s fans at the Olympics in Rio 2016 have gone crazy by French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive double being of the Queen of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting about gold this summer, who can brag about his own famous double being - at least according to the social media.
So, in honor of Rio's races and all the famous faces on our screens today, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who seem to be clearly Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: The member of the U.S. men's bowing team Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's double character on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain bowman could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
The U.S. men's bowing team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter since the surface of his images, where he seems to be intimidating as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the passion of social media, the archbishop admitted that he had heard from Leo since he was a child.
"In fact, I don't see a great consensus, except maybe about the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons of London in 2012 will certainly emerge this year as well: alarming the convergence of British long-term jumpsuits between Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina's largest, obvious eyes have been said to be a Cuban American singer, Gloria Estefan's double being.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been comparing the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
Greater shift to eye: This user thinks that Nathan is an Inception actor's "sportous version"
Another long-term comparison has been tennisist between Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of which have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than the same actor Annalynne McCord as the tanned skin and light hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian reminds us by fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitti's sporting version".
Hard Women: Football Star Hope Solo, Left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share the same face and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a pair of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness at the site that "the rest of the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter actress have an incredible similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful broad smile matches the Gabrielle Union's smile.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for the Chinese swimmer's "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonaldi's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth message of women's 4x200-metre release raged the CBC's live Olympic broadcast viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC had to apologize after one of its surveyors said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese woman who had lost the smell of evil and died like a pig.
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in women's 4x200 meters release media.
MacDonaldi, who came to the CBC's recording team to bring "color", heard him say, "That little 14-year-old from China, baby.
Too enthusiastic, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
"Thank you for that."
Chinese Emperor Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at the second part of the message 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, giving Canada the opportunity to catch China.
Viewers around Canada quickly react online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane twiitta said, "Did the CBC explorer just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer died like a pig?"
"The idiot didn't realize he was still on a live broadcast."
China's Ai Yanhan was described in a 4 x 200 m communicationfinal of women's release: "This little 14-year-old China, baby."
The review of Byron MacDonaldi on Twitter was bold and fast, for many while challenging him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard of Byron MacDonald.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound racist.
Soon after that, Scott Russell, who was running a CBC transmission, asked for his comment on the direct broadcast, saying, "We would like to say that the comment on the swimsuit was sent.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that happened."
The CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times for people who had twivated their comments.
Scott Russel, a reporter, had to apologize for MacDonald.
Then the CBC copy and attached an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret the fact that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Last night, we quickly took action and, on a direct broadcast, we apologized to our viewers and our followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for his message.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized for a direct broadcast and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made yesterday after women's message," said the CBC at the Olympic Games.
"I've missed the swimmer's performance, not as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it disrespectful, and I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was stunned by a woman who suffocatedly adjusted her underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know what to watch when she got away in the middle of Primark's movement to try underwear.
It did not improve the situation by assessing what she looked like in her pants, the woman peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually agreed with four underwear pairs at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkestone, where she had to fit her underwear and then put it back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the store, said that after having tried underwear, the mysterious woman "beaded again and walked away without buying anything".
He said, "The people didn't believe in their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took some of her underwear, took her own tights and underwear, and put on her feet.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood there shameless."
"All stared at him while he took off his underwear, and clearly he didn't like it because he put it back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally decided that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about a person who would end up buying the underwear he made."
33-year-old Davidson in Kent's city said, "It's disgusting to think that someone takes home the underwear that someone else has tried, but they're not cleaned."
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I told you that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothing from the sale after she left, which is all right."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find out that another woman's put them on and took them off, and they haven't been washed."
Primark's representative said: 'Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August in Folkestone's movement.
All these products have been removed from the sale."
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation Grand Commander Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with gun-cracking robbers in close distance.
You were approached from the front or back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker at the same rate.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and say, "You're gonna cut the line of fire."
Then you catch the weapon between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting the knee, and when the attacker goes to pain the spark, turn the gun from his hand, punch him in the back face, and hold the gun on to him.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, tap the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time put weight on the gun and strike the attacker into the chest, then turn the weapon on his grip, back and point him at the gun.
Does that sound awkward?
Look at the video exactly how Mizrach does this.
But remember, if you're not the great master of Krav Mag, the safest way out of the robbery is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a trip
The British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and vomiting reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most nightly places.
The drunkard from Suffolk and the travel writer Ian Wright, 51, his arrows in the euro banknote, the street Piccadilly Circus, the toilet license of the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was facing.
However, the experiment made by a film called Inner Power did produce surprising results.
The idea that thousands of people are using the train’s washing license may seem totally reluctant, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
I'm glad nothing else left him with a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well - known tester of persuasion in traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Indeed, this task, which extends beyond the spraying licence of the toilets of public railway stations, has tested his immune system.
In the film he said, "From the day of my father, I have been quite careless about my health, and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth from the dust, the worms, and the dirty water."
He definitely confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had more than 4,000 units on the photometer.
Because of the comparison, the number of resistance hands should be less than 60.
But in a public visit to Russia, he refused to lick when the photometer's result showed more than 4,000 units, and the counters' hands were less than 60.
Wright has produced the traveler's film, followed by internal power, together with Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna say anything 'cause it's gonna be night-night in here.
After the internal force was produced together with the Finnish meier, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and vitamin D that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of the selection of snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.
We threw up a lot of crazy ideas, and we ended up with the idea of 'let' Ian.'
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell our everyday environment about the good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can interestingly tell more about it to consumers.
I also think that the documentary shows that we have a wonderful sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the document, added: "Let's say it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him, like the Russian man I was talking about in the film, I would have lost my respect for him."
Obviously, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while the part was rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows saved."
In a survey conducted in 2015, 84% of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58% said that they at least use products that have been added to milk acid bacteria.
The old-fashioned family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall Saltash before we turned.
The long-term family caused damage of £50,000 to their tenants after they were evicted for the terrorisation of their neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the real estate in Cornwall Saltash since they had been complained about a number of times.
After they had been removed from the property by force, the shocked workers of the housing company said that the property was in poor condition.
The walls had been made with horrid holes, floor boards torn, waste was spread on the floor, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family has now moved away, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the host of Cornwall Houston, said he was afraid he couldn't fix the property.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are many points to consider, as this property is likely to be known through the less appropriate groups of Cornwall.
This family is bad-looking, and their name is bad-looking."
According to the police, there were three sons who lived in a real estate, and the family's fear was to include a street fight in baseball lands, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and inexplicable screaming, fighting and cursing.
A 47-year-old Skeldon, who was entitled to a lease agreement, received a decision in June on non-social behaviour.
Many of the rooms under the break-in threat found old waste.
The property I've been selling drugs from in the past, the floor boards have been pulled up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting in the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Houston evicted force from a woman’s and partner’s real estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, the time to volunteerly change.
The relieved neighbors thanked me for the weighting, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen a police officer here an incredible number of times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet, we haven't used to it!
I love it now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of the Cornwall Houston neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police often called the property
The trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wilded wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's conduct, because the weighting is always the last of Cornwall Houston's course of action.
This was a very difficult case, for their conduct was extreme, and their actions must have terrified neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the brave, informed members of the community.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that anti-social use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in properties at different times, but they were all in twenty.
After wedding, one of the dirty mattresses on the floor of the bedroom
The employees of the housing company must now clean up the waste surfaces around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as foam, supplies as well as 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined by his guilt for holding a class b drug as a intention to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners are living homeless now in private accommodation in Plymouth.
A lot of the walls in the house were surrounded by graffiti.
The police say they're trying to take out residents who've been making fun of the rules of their leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said that the weighting was a clear warning to other tenants who would continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct has no consequences, and to those who suffer such conduct," he said.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social use, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were terrified when the military jet flew from the beach to the bottom of the hippo
Solarists in Portugal Aveiro experienced a shock in their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion jet would wipe out very low
The Air Force said that it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At the very moment, the horrid tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet wiped over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft became almost exposed to the sunwrecks on the sand track at the North Portugal Aveiro.
The vacationers stood up as they began to worry clearly about the noise from the jet, even though they did not begin to see what was coming behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who published videos of dramatic passing through social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and one point seemed to be falling into the ground."
Nuno Arros added, "I was surfing, and it really felt like the machine was falling on me."
The tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to the bad visibility caused by smoke from nearby earthtops, but the Air Force assured me that nobody was in danger.
Land fires have destroyed parts of Manner-Portugal this summer, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly because of the low visibility of the affected conditions, the smoke caused by the soils and the thick fog,
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
The result of the first half of the exam better than expected
The social and health district of Southern Karelia (Exote) did a better job in January - June of EUR 3.4 million than planned.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to decompose institutional care.
The care guarantee was carried out in all operations.
This year, Exote is trying to shorten the lines of action.
Exote will cover the deficit that has been created in the past by the surplus.
The remainder may be used to shorten the lines and to buy measures in patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exoten government will discuss the mid-term review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Guards swear on military light in Imvola
70 crew members of the Border and Coast Guard School took military vows on Friday.
The military elections of the Border and Coast Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
The Ten Special Borders Course lighting was organised at the sports field of the equipment.
There were 70 armed men who took the military vows.
Special border guards will be trained for demanding border safety, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied for a special limit.
They were called 250 for their choice.
Special border ice creams have been trained in Immola since 2007.
There were five veterans of the border forces during the war in connection with the outbreak.
The average age of those present is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A limited number of bandits ahead - criminal intelligence helps to investigate and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police agencies in Finland has been a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit is outside invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna belong to the Hämeen Castle.
It's pulled by a sergeant placed in Lahti.
He's a lead man. He's working for Lieutenant Lahde.
In addition, the strength of the unit belongs to a civilian person dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian suits.
The department has demonstrated its suitability and necessity, looks at Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides different investigations to other police.
It has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
Newest reform of working methods
The establishment of an analysis unit is the reform of the latest police working practices.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, that the police are increasingly less and less likely to leave the wars only when they get the alarm.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will target daily police activities where they are most needed.
The reform of the police administration led to the establishment of a criminal intelligence centre, under three national units, and each police station its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa in the context of the Central Crime Police will run its operations nationally.
PTR units are known to work for the police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, for their part, work with police departments in shared areas and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national units.
This information extends beyond its own territory.
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because it does so.
Those working in the RTA unit have better expertise in basic policies.
The unit seeks to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminals, or crimes similar to each other, through registers, alarm database and observations.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of this act, the factor is made up of a certain kind of image.
It can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Errors
The employees of the RTA unit do not run the streets in the city upright, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both criminals are not mentioned, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention companies.
The police are publicly reporting procedures if they are expected to pose a threat.
This case, for example, was a first - summer news, a way to record empty dwellings in housing accidents.
In that case, the factors put the house outside of the door a stick, a button pin or a tape board to try if the residents were really on their way.
The examination material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most clever ones order a protocol of law, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
The next time you steal gloves, you go hand in hand.
For this matter, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppus has been interviewed from the Hämä police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the police in Eastern Finland, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu police station and Detective Inspector Arto Tumela from Central Crime Police.
Police are collecting and analysing information that will help to plan practical activities.
In the context of a reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last amendment was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation gathers information from outside the boundaries of the organization and Finland.
Daddy-related schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join Isis, is reported to have died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasime Akujee said that the girl's family heard this dead in Syria Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike to Raqqqa, which is an organization base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died when she was about to escape the war from tearing the country and returning to Britain.
"It can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and will for others that the risk of leaving the war zone is real - that it could lead people to give up such a decision," Akujee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern schoolgirls flew to Turkey on a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she was married to Isis in Syria, and that she only became a widow after a few months.
Reid says Clinton's running for Garland's Supreme Court if he's elected.
The Senate Democratic President Harry Reid says he is convinced that the presidential candidate for democracy Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mr McConnell, director of the Senate's majority, says that the next president chooses to replace Mr Antonin Scalia, the highest court member.
On Thursday's telephone conference, Reid said he's predicting, with some degree of certainty, that Clinton chooses Garland.
Later, the representative of Reid said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He congratulated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "draw the boat" by a new choice.
Garland is the Supreme Court of the United States in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans preventing Garland's appointment are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "steams" and "possibles".
He said Trump wouldn't fit in.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men"
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find their next state-of-the-art generation 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, told us earlier this year that his paper containing a lot of naked photos differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks there's a calendar for them too.
"We must begin again to show timeless and classical nakedness in which women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these naked images of women", Shaw said in a press release that announced the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures through the network or personally open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: Who really buys records?
Lone, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill the comment with the irritant insults of the comment, whose author has the name "NoAllLong-agedMieves," notices that this claim is based on actual information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of many of the talks is not because more and more people born this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the obsessiveness of the middle age.
Apparently, those who recently bought a vinyl record are most likely to be 45 to 54 years old.
In fact, most likely, the albums are purchased by the age group of 18 to 24 years old.
It is also not only about the collection of hobbyists, but it includes the meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy their singleness (66% vs 66%).
But do you think youGov's results are true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk into a busy street in Soho, above me the modest gray suit. I would be looking forward to referring to the moment before I would stop, I would form a cup of hands and say something valuable, like, "Let's look into it more closely."
Let's have a closer look at this.
At the same time as Soho's charm and dirt slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and stores and office supplies now fill buildings where previously there were independent shops - there are still plenty of fancy specialised record stores left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to a variety of men in some of these stores while trying to assess by observing their age and emotions.
The Glasgowan Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (e.g. two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (e.g. eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends her afternoon meeting in London, and turns the shops around to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I'm fine," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, which appear above the picture (i.e. sent the sample by e-mail, did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such an enormous quantity of records and singles is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and without money.
"A large part of the material I bought is late in the late '60s and early '70s, albums that were published when there were 11 or 12 albums, which I was probably a little too young to obtain," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of albums are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their company, and he adds: "I do not smoke or drink much.
This is my bad."
25-year-old Wez, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he encounter fit into YouGov's profile.
He has noticed, however, the people of the new wave, to which media enthusiasm has influenced. People who have heard that albums have come back to fashion and who have become the need to buy their old albums back.
On the basis of the discussions I have been having, people have generally got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back," he says.
This can explain an increase in the number of certain age-old vinyl peas.
But what about the alleged emotional mark of the records?
In a trade like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record shops offer comfort to similar types of community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the nearby payment system.
Some vinyl fans can hack into the digital world and choose to rely on the permanentness of the familiar disc covers; objects that raise memories of teen's happy days.
"I think it may sometimes be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that belongs to objects," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" The other worker suddenly said from the top of the plate.
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a disc player that they never use, whereas 7% of people buying tips do not have a disk player.
This part of the news report is likely to look like a serious concern to my browser about the stack of boss's nova meetings.
This rise in "a prize" perspective is something that also works in Sounds of the Universe ( counter: three middle-aged men) Jonny, 42, has been noticed.
"Who came in a little while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead's disc so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large part, but this is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So, not parents, but younger people, late-aged people, who are just getting excited about it.
In a fiction where today is almost a whole layer reserved for vinyls, I have a much more diverse audience arriving.
Seventy-five couples, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the movements mentioned earlier, the sounding of the fresh boulder Wild Beast's fresh scapegoat and sexist pop, and not the improvisation jazz is great to see a variety of customers.
None of them looks very lonely, but it's hard to show the exact psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopia for a few minutes looking at different records in sales.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so it's not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either through a computer or through something else, but the beauty of a vinyl is..." she takes care of her fall in love.
"I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique."
My final stop is said to have raised the generation of new vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to make it look like I'm looking at jeans, I'm observing a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a while before Dad and daughter thought about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left there is a stairway with walls of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential records of any middle collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorations, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
It's a clean "artiquils".
However, given that even a small attention to these objects can mean more money for industry and send some customers to the Soho sinks for more, there is not much to complain about.
It is not surprising that the population with more time and money than others is also the one who uses the most for luxury people, such as vinyls.
But even if my findings indicate that the results of YouGov are accurate at least in Soho's records stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
Indeed, they do not spend Thursday mornings by mapping around the Berwick Street record shops, placing discs and avoiding a harsh, 30-year-old TV driver’s watch over the shoulders of unsuspected middle-aged men.
The Holker is the most distant, vertebrate animal - video report
Researchers say that the vault has a longer life span than any other planet on its spine.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is on a female scale, which is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and is five metres long.
The French court rejects the application for the removal of trades from Jungle refugee camps
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to remove dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In the course of the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to decommission a total of 72 temporary trades, where people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks within the camp, offer hair cuts or sell tea with 50 cent (40 pences), or sell simple food in a few euro temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office argued that the sites should be landed because they represent non-payable parallel economy and are at a risk of fire and cleaning.
The humanitarian groups have told the Court that trade and restaurants are vital, in other words, free meals offered by the state-supported organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary stores and restaurants often offer protection and free meals for those who need them.
The judge in Lille ordered that there were no legal grounds for exodus of 72 people who were running a temporary store, but said that Calais's prefect concern was "he completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants had a much greater role to play than just feeding people who live in "extensively uncertain conditions".
He said that facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the break threat was the camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose operation is unprofitable and offers 200 meals daily, English and French hours as well as asylum supplies for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the café would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - to the top lock - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than on average in the EU
In Finland, food is severely reduced to the satisfaction of consumers and the harm of producers.
In Finland, food prices have fallen by almost 5% in three years, with an average fall of 0.9% in EU countries.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has increased by 1%.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from those EU countries where there is a similar level of pay as in Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the article published in the Tieto & Trendit blog, Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of Statistics Finland’s development.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage of EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the translation, after which the food has become cheaper for a year.
Russia's food import bans are now under pressure, which have stifled food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Puntin's policy has helped Finnish consumers with a short perspective", says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition for industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The high trade chains S-group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not the types of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country with a wage level similar to Finland.
According to the press, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on value added tax.
He found that if analogue countries had the same rate of VAT, they would sell the cheapest food in Finland from countries similar to the same level of wages.
The magazine compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If VAT rates were seven in the analogue countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell better food than Finns would.
"If we want to reach EU levels at food prices in the old EU countries, we must halve VAT to the EU's average level and continue the price competition", Lehtinen writes.
The paper points out that the VAT rate he has calculated is indicative.
School's not exactly the same anymore.
Those returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the academic year in all secondary schools.
It is a guide for all schools in Finland to operate.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of beauty is given up, and schools instead begin to practice codem.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social learning is already being read in four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
In the past, it was considered that the teacher teaches students, but now everyone must be active and learn from one another.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest spine found an ice shark can live for up to 400 years.
To the ice-fish known as Greenlandian shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at 150 years of age.
It can live after 250 years, report a new investigation.
The figures make the species the longest backbone of today’s world.
In the animal population it is only passed by an Icelandic girl whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to age 507.
The Greenlandic sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Women stretch for longer, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Since the growth rate is slow, the congregations say that only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues found out.
He defined the age of the adults from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbonisation of eye lenses.
The average age of the shark studied was 272 years or more.
Two of the biggest fish in the sample, 493 and 502-cent Amazonians, were found at approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that the ice sharks reach sexual maturity only over 4 metres, researchers have calculated that they are approximately 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann is fired from almost 300, not the sellers.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company that made trouble ended at the beginning of August.
"The outcome of the negotiations is to reduce about 300 jobs, the majority of which will be carried out in the form of dismissals", says Stockmann.
It states that the number of sellers in the goods industry is not reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, around 80 workers in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
The Stockmann yt negotiations concerned around 3 000 workers.
At their start, the need for a reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction in the amount of this reduction is aimed at the annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to be achieved next year.
Stockmann has already launched a efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is the difficulty of making Stockmann profitable.
Although the adjusted operating result of the Group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, the trade in goods is still losing.
See Stockmann. According to Lauri Veijalainen, CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales premises have not met the company's objectives.
"The reduction of staff is unfortunately necessary in order to ensure a positive operating result on Stockmann Retail in 2018", Veijalainen states in the communication.
The result improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved his net sales and profit for the second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year’s Group’s net sales will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
On Friday, it's rainiest in the north, temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure center on the north side of Finland keeps the weather on a rainy Friday, tells the meteorologist Ilona Láng.
In the middle of the country too, rain cubes come, but the south is southward.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country remains below 20 degrees.
In northern rainy areas, 10-15 are left behind.
Kenya’s General Sports Team shakes out a special explanation for dopingsandal coach’s campaign
Kenian sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it became apparent that Anzrah was present in the national team as a athlete in doping test.
The News Office AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to show up is a 800 meters star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team management, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina.
Doping officials came to the authorities in Anzra.
According to Soi, Anzhah was sent home because he "made a crime against Kenya's country team".
He was a athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the papers.
We cannot accept this use," Kip Keino, Chairman of the European Olympic Committee in Kenya, would, in turn, rock the news office for Reuters.
Olympics’ general sport begins on Friday, and Roth is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was placed last year in the World Championships on the way to the fourth level and has pre-empted Rio’s winning contributions.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya’s sports team claimed that Anzrah was passing the sportsman’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to officials because he was afraid he'd show up," the source told me.
Where is everybody?
Rio's sports stadium is dripping out
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least, they don't watch sports.
In Rio, a fight started on Friday on the medals of public sports, but the world’s top artists were able to present their skills to a confusing empty view.
Rio’s organiser said on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first morning tickets and 65 per cent of the evening tickets have been sold.
It was another four years ago in London, where the stadium pulsed for a cheery crowd.
The tickets to the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics’ loss of sight has attracted attention even before general sports.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the views of rugby, melon and horse riding.
When Brazil’s medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach balloons in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian twins, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 audiences were filled.
Bad behaviour is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, struggling in economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian competitions, and many Olympics are strange for Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even Brazil’s football team’s first match did not allow the football stadium to be drawn to its full.
On the weekend, editor Mario Andrada reported that 82 per cent of tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
"There is still 1.1 million left for sale," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
In London, 8,5 million tickets were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half more than in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the Summer Olympics in London, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, as organisers need money and try to get tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, though, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less well-known types of school in the country, such as golf and rugby.
The Rio Stadium had empty seats this morning.
Even beach balloons in the Copacabana sand have not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Centralsalo competed in London in 2012.
There's plenty of people in the papers.
New way of protecting nature - Get the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, set up last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
It will then be possible for private, business and communities to redeem rights to the land by money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The area is virtually divided into blocks that are willing to acquire rights against payment of the right of holder.
The administrator receives 187 square blocks of veto law, which in practice means that each holder does not need approval if the use of the land is to be changed.
It is also possible to acquire rights in several areas.
The acquisition of a right of control is something concrete that can be left with your heritage or given as a gift.
There is no need to go down to banderoles or chain themselves somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Leviäkanu, who acquired control of his company.
Those who have acquired the right to manage receive accurate location information from their block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
The names of the recipients of the rights of the holder are available on the website of the Foundation in the same map as the area's block data.
The only risk that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea is to protect its nature.
The Helsinki Foundation is a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting environmental and natural protection.
It is a risk that the Foundation would act in some form of an ethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is the protection of natural areas so that they can be inviolable and peaceful.
The Foundation will acquire land, either by buying or by making donations.
It is mainly financed by the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to obtain additional protection countries.
It is also aimed outside the borders of Finland and plans to land in Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities at the pop up forest at the Helsinki Shopping Hall on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves torture Turku from the great cities - look at the situation in your municipality
The bicycle thieves torture Turku, the largest cities in Finland.
This year, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, there has been more rounding than in nine other largest cities.
Based on reported wheelchair thefts by the Helsinki Times, the number of bicycles stolen in ten largest cities in January to August of this year and parts of them per thousand inhabitants was determined.
In addition to Turku, the top rose to Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti.
According to the police, four out of five wheelchairs per thousand inhabitants took place.
Instead, only about two wheels per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double thefts are carried out in proportion to the number of inhabitants compared to others," described Tommi Reen, police inspector at the police administration.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
"The extent to which things are common can be influenced by how much the city is moving around and how many wheels there are at the top of it", is considered by Sergeant Teemu Auteus.
According to Tommi Reen, the police administration is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and a lot of spins available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a different city in which urban centres are at a distance and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport", Reen says.
In January to August, there have been slightly fewer wheelchair thefts throughout Finland than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, there is no cause for great joy.
Despite recent years' decline, there will be a little more than 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 fillaries every day and only in Helsinki is about 4 000 wheels a year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, for only part of the victims report to the police in theft.
Reen calls on people to report crime on wheelchair theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to the police will survive.
A typical cleared wheelchair thief is one where the police receive information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"There are also other cases in the investigation when, for example, you can find stolen wheels in a drug case", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly by themselves or in connection with a police investigation, says older Officer Timo Leppämämämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen, for example, from the wheelchairs, interiors, warehouses and wheelchairs of commercial centres, i.e. practically everywhere they are stored.
One of the most individual bike models is stolen in the past years like Jopos.
The U-lock provides better protection for the wheel than for many other types of lock.
Some thieves take a bike, for example, for their short-term use, but much of the wheels stolen end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They're on the domestic market.
"At least it's never come to the police to know that stolen wheels would go nowhere," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
I'm sure part of it will buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the wheel used must be careful, as he may commit a covert crime or violation.
"The alarm clocks should be ringing if a good fit of wheels are sold in their clear areas," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, special library official, carries the colourful Nopsa for the favors of Kallio's library in Helsinki at all times during its working day.
He's had five pieces of bikes, but none of them's been stolen, Hirvi says, "No one's ever been taken, so there's been a good monk."
"Though this may not be so attractive to thieves, this may not necessarily be the hipster value", the Helsinki Hirvi wonders.
In the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siuri Valve quickly locked its bike with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike hit the wall, but the Watch usually locks its bike into something solid, like a wheelchair.
"There will be quite a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own", says the Helsinki student of his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time they hear from their friends they've taken rounds."
"Most bad wheels, such dirty-ass-ass."
A bike was stolen from the guard himself from the inside of the building company a year ago.
The wheel had been locked, though, so the Watch could wait to give it up.
Under 15 years of responsibility for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer flight crews familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, we are experimenting with a so-called peer-to-peer crew to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment is applicable to people under 15 who are now under criminal liability.
We don't have the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that a peer-to-peer will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and determine the penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator can join a peer-to-peer crew to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may be a letter written to the family, explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Executive Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not tight.
We also have other forms of conciliation that are used in parallel.
"All are guided in a more responsible direction by a young person, so that not everything will go wrong with the first mistake," says Laitio.
In the United States, a model has been taken for a peer-to-peer crew, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person will not face an adult panel but reflexe what happened to the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The service design agency Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio reports that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first offences of people under 15 have not necessarily been dealt with before.
"It's been a message to keep going on the road you've chosen," Lovio says.
The reference flight crew is part of the Helsinki project for immigrant young people, followed by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio points out that new ways of working are being offered to all those who need it, not just for immigrants.
More than 70 Republican actors want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
Politico, U.S.A., reported in the letter, received a draft from it.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money directed to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his lack of respect, incompetence and record dissatisfaction threaten to be brought to the Democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only the direct orientation of all possible funds in Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in Trump's decorative anchor's neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election will be reduced by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
These include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons organized by the letter is obviously the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who resists Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "humans who want a party to protect the majority in Congress" and that it is not anybody's support.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump, which are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous autoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families
In the United States, President-in-Office Hillary Clinton reported details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the US economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends", Clinton said in his speech.
Clinton’s plan focuses on a massive, $275 billion five-year programme to improve the U.S. infrastructure road, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a hand-holding for the American duunares, who suffer from the transfer of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in decent jobs after World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to construction!
Clinton told me.
Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, emphasising that rich people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be tax-free, it has to pay for the source tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"I am against all trade agreements that operate against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
According to speculations published before Clinton's speech, the Washington Post was going to judge the Republican Donald Trump's financial programme, which was released on Monday, that it "only favours millions like this".
Trump's proposal for a reduction in corporate tax has previously been called 'Trump Porsche'.
Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump manufactures himself in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America a big one again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton squealed.
These are Rio's viewers: The rails have not glued Finnish Roses, but the mobile app is interested
Usually sports competitions appear in TV viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympics in Rio have so far not achieved any number of viewers.
At the same time, competitions have glued to the top 12% of the population, with 615 000 viewers from Yle Olympic Channel on Tuesday evenings.
For the purposes of comparison: EM competitions of a month ago received almost 800 000 viewers at a time by TV2 and a well-known second million football EM competitions.
The Olympics have so far been interested in cycling on Sunday night and in opening the fifth day of competition, both of which reached the Olympic Channel almost half a million viewers at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Chief of Sports, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that the viewers will be divided into several different instruments for the first time in the Olympics in Rio.
In addition to TV, Finns will follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers at all choose the Olympic Games.
Even on TV, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympics in Rio are the first sports competition Yle has dedicated a whole channel to.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are always from 20,000 to 500 000, it's a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than in London 2012 or in Beijing 2008 but the difference in time is partly explained by the difference in time - much of Rio's competitions become in Finland during the nighttime.
Another reason for a loose interest - if it is now considered to be mild - is certainly a traditional Finnish cause: if Finland had taken from the initial competition some surprise medal, the interest would have pompsahed up with it.
In addition, sport is only about to start, as is the case with other Finnish interested species: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When general sports begins, the viewers will explode.
Yle launched a mobile application for the competitions Yle Rio 2016 which rose during the first days of the races at Apple App Store, Finland’s most downloadable free application.
By Monday, the application had been downloaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're already on 200,000 downloads.
"We can only get the Verkko viewers later", Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not been desirable for all users.
Pokkinen says there's been feedback and the bugs have been repaired.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by a delay and other small technical problems in the early stages.
An updated version of the applications has been obtained, which should correct errors.
The Olympics in Rio will appear on Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sports event ever.
The Yle Fem can follow some species, and on the radio Yle Phone communicates races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborers for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only follow from Yle's channels.
From 2018 the Olympic Games will be observed both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deep lake of Finland?
According to official statistics, the deep lake of Finland is your sun, which has a depth of 95,3 meters on Ristinselä.
It might be even deeper.
The techmilling instructor Matti Kannela found a weight of about 20 square meters from Crossisel, the bottom of which was shown to be a depth of 104 meters.
In summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre sought to confirm the observation by excavating.
The method may not be able to find a slight deepening of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95,3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvas water (90 meters).
Over 80 metres are Saimaa, Toisvesi and Lake Main.
They haven't been studied as closely as your sun.
Especially the bottom of the Inari Lake has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Lake Jukkajärvi, 23 meters.
So looking at your sun, you can't get into the top ten, and Suvasvesi is further away from the top.
August 12 at 14.29: Corrected last piece, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Ihalainen from the tax point of view: Pensioners' tax is still more stringent
Pensioners' tax is still tighter than employees.
The Ihalainen says that the gap came under Parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to equalise employees.
This is not included in the Government's presentation.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises that have been made should be followed after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income reductions which reduced taxation.
In the Parliament, the case was heated by the opposition representatives who were embroiled by the mandates of the Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbia (Kok).
The purchasing power is secured, it won't grow.
According to Ihalainen, the line presented by Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (Kok) is mainly about securing and increasing purchasing power, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax reductions will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
The Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (cent.) and Orpo, who are eager to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached.
He says that holding up this agreement is important for credibility.
It is the main economic and employment policy activity of the government.
It is done with the power of the social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It becomes necessary because the economy is so much in favour of domestic demand and people's own future.
Impairment of long-term unemployment
The Irish call on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of increasing the employment rate to 72% is to escape.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims at the attacks in Thailand
At least four people died in bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy calls on Finns in Finland to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
After all, it is not appropriate for Finnish tourists in Thailand to cancel their journey because of explosives, but it is advisable to follow the instructions of the embassy for caution, says Westphalen.
In Thailand very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai period of travel is scheduled for one year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has sought, in particular, the Finns in Hua Hini to find out about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts at Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, we don't have any information on the subject of the attacks yet.
The Ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political unrest of the Thai divided society and to the referendum last week by the military train.
The law was adopted by a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, in turn, there is an ethnic conflict with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local party in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city is celebrating the queen's birthday and her mother's day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks affect the day so that the authorities are very precise about safety.
Thailand Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, says Thailand Police News Office, according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as those popular by tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at night, reports Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, there were no deaths.
Two bombs exploded according to the magazine at the Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ngas, where according to the magazine one person was wounded.
According to the local authorities, a total of four bombs have been bombed in the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
In either of the double-bomb shots, at least one died.
In addition, in the village of Surat Than, South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in each city of Trang.
In both attacks, at least one person died.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, for it is carried to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday island.
Not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thai military train, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are a attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don't have to make people panic any more, he told the journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Secretary for Security, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in Finland to be careful and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
After all, it is not appropriate for Thai Finns to cancel their journey because of explosives, but it is worth taking care, says Westphalen.
In the affected Europeans
There is very little known about attacks during the Finnish night and their victims.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been a little more time to get information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian among those injured.
In the second attack of Hua Hin, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the clock tower known as the sighting.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated the Hua Hin area from which it believes it has found another bomb.
According to the governor of the county, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bench.
A municipal worker died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The police chief interviewed by CNN says that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded every about half an hour.
Bangkok Post says the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the Women's Boxing
The United States Alexandra Raisman was second point 60.098 and Russia Alija Mustafina's third score of 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for television championships in Rio with perman, jump and boom.
The party has been holding women's gymnastics for a long time in recent years.
He has had eight individual world championships for the past three years.
He has won the four-balling and permanine championships three times in a row as well as in the last and second years of the boom.
At the U.S. team, Bales has reached the World Championship in two teams.
It's a little bit darker, but it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The person has no influence on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a children's play club in Thailand Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bomb attacks on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think that this will follow anything more amazing, evaluate Huovila, who worked in Asia for about 20 years.
A experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many Thai tried tragedy.
There's always something here.
At first there was a tsunami, then a bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these past tourists haven't escaped, I don't think this is it.
The Huovla company office is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
Huovla heard about the attack from his own employee.
At about nine o'clock, the employee called the office and said that it would be best not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the coastside and the main mine Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work this morning in the same way as usual.
They thought that roadblocks had been laid for the queen's birthday, says Huovila, and refers to Friday's holidays in Thailand.
The Pathon atmosphere was calm and the main cover movements were allowed to open at about 10 p.m. local time.
Many on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At about three days, Thailand’s time in the Patong had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila.
Later this car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholminti.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
Partio found two men fit for a sense mark hidden in a nearby hexagon.
Another man got caught right away.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage of a motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear move aside
On Friday, a high-value change of leadership took place in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-scientific. He was Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for separating Ivanov can be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from gathering too much power around him.
He adds that recycling of leadership is one of the ways of power.
This is a way to prevent people from levying independent power on themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been mutilated with other managers or mutilated.
Arms drop to Ivanoville
Ivanov, within the inside of the Putin, is moving to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
By means of a tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed to replace Vaino, told Russia Today.
The Kangaspuro says that, from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear shut-down.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian regime.
Furthermore, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnönniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin will change his neighborhood younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield as they retreated to Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape into the city of Jarabulus, so that we could not aim at them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were exported to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdite fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which was important to Fathers.
However, it is estimated that ten jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Revised news at 7:30 p.m.: In the past, we incorrectly told that civilians were about to flee the city, in fact, the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians while they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior document publication policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutist tells STT that the public can't be based on the Authority's own policies, but is based on law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to issue a list of participants to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by instructions from the Government's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Ministry's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Minister's Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
Like in recent years, Bolt has been running against time under precious races.
From the early season, he violated his back and had to skip the Jamaican Olympic Games.
This has not been perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included little samba dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt is surrounded by the fact that the Japanese star has risen in the age of time when sports has been struggling with doping scandalals and persevering interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he escaped in the early 200 meters of time 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and loose position of your training.
Four years later, his reign in Beijing began at a hundred meters, where he crushed the world record and the confidence of the competitors despite the final ceremony of 9,69.
It's harder than that.
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached his career at a point in law.
World records in Berlin are still valid at 9,58 hundreds of meters and 19,19 two centuries.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his pursuit of a 200-foot world record and a 19-second discount, but no one believes that it is born except Bolt himself.
In the rain, Bolt’s most challenging is Justin Gatlin, winner of the 2004 100th Olympic Games in Athens.
Last year in Beijing's MM-final Bolt defeated the American with only one hundredth century secondary.
Bolt has not been lost in the finals of prizes during his reign in Beijing for once if he has only been able to travel.
In Daegu 2011, the MM-final of 100 remained unrunned from Bolt because of the flash start.
Bolt will fill in a lot in a week after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The final finish line for the Ura, Bolt, has set the Next year World Championships in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Disputes from Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, the Chinese newspaper Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Olympics in Rio.
There were traces of prohibited substances found in the sample of the Chinese giant Chen Xiny.
Bulgarian beverages Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenian sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of eu-hormonic.
He was in Rio fourth in women's 100 meters of butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Etadao, the Chinese Supreme Court has brought its case of doping to the proceedings of the International Court of Appeal of Sport.
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have found evidence of hydrochlorothiazide diuretics.
Rio has also revealed other doping pills.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female drinkers Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of eu-hormon.
Kenya has, for its part, moved from Rio to the home of the sports coach because of the doping exercise.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenian coach had acted as a athlete in the test and had given a doping sample to this effect.
According to the media, it is the Kenian fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich’s race of 800 meters in a situation.
The Phelps aren't stopping at all... the historic gold came in the show-style.
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics, the United States of America Michael Phelps swim 200 meters in a mixture of 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps reached the first bathing area of the same species from the Olympic Games of the same species in the fourth consecutive races.
The winning time for the Phelps was 1.54.66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was mixed up in the second time before the Chinese Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have some fun, Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympic Compartmenter, laughs at the evening page for a quick interview.
The case from Helen Skkelton (a.k.a.) on Monday is one of the most popular websites of this week's evening magazine.
I'm visiting a commentator named Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not very stressed if there is a small noise in the sound or British press about his exposed and unusual costumes.
The TV's a visual media, he's pressing.
Skelton's dressed in high-rate shoes and short-sleeved dress, with at least sufficient exposedness, at least in the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there is no guarantee.
It's important to look good, and small things are just a funny thing.
Well, I'm sure Skelton wants to scare you and maybe bother you, but he'll stress that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I dress up.
Can you imagine that the womb has reached Finland?
I can't, but all that's paying attention to how hard these swimmers do their job and how big sacrifices they make is fine for me, Skelto's agitated.
You know what?
It'll be out of nowhere if it comes from dressing up (a runner).
I'm just a little curious if someone's been hit by one of them.
Rio's police did two arrests for terrorist possession.
On Thursday, Rio's police reported that it's arrested two people for counter-terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the security oversight of the races.
The police did five other arrests at the same time and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 News site, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as the police already arrested in July.
Arrested persons are believed to have contacts with the Isis Organisation.
The arresters had reportedly exposed violence in social media.
Messages that were called upon to violence had been distributed, among other things, in the recommended WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's races is equivalent to 85,000 police officers.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their Rio basketball tournament in an empty-gold game on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place out of the audience.
The police let the public in after they blew up the package in a controlled manner.
This was the third time in Rio's Olympics since the police have performed a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package.
The audience got in after the police had safely blew up the package.
The audience did not see it by the beginning of the match because the police closed the arena toll because of a suspicious package.
The police blew up the package and let the audience rule until after that.
The drink woke the races to a sleepy start for the Spanish team.
With two losses, Spain started with Nigeria score 96-87.
In the two previous races, Spain reached silver.
The police have already performed a controlled explosion mission for the third time during the Rio summer contest.
Last time, the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the site of road cycling last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty audiences.
Argentine's lady dressed up as the Petator-Siren - a Finnish woman thought about the protest
The wind of the Petjo-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind of Petjari-Siren was a tough one on Thursday.
Argentine lady dressed Tuuli Pettaja-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the day of women's surfing.
There was a clear breach of the wind.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He got stuck because of the accident, and others ran away; Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
A athlete had a long time to consider protest.
Then it was not worth doing because it would have been futile according to the Olympic rules.
I should've dropped in the water so I could get a refund," said Pettaja-Siren.
The Finnish hanged on the ferry until the last time, because she didn't want to go to Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish person left behind 27 with the car crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The accident didn't seem to have much effect.
It's a big day on Friday when we have to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Pettä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 specific issues which, according to science, increase age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years into the life of a person.
Some of the things are customs that affect person’s health directly or indirectly so that his life lasts longer.
Sometimes, on other occasions, things that a person himself cannot influence can bring to him extra years.
These include the tendency to moderately or to a social position.
Regular shopping may extend the age.
You don't even have to do that. All you have to do is get a milk can.
The secret of a long time has been sought by many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drink of fish and coffee
Coffee drinks have been shown to be protected from cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease.
Harvard University's research noted that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "lower risk of death", particularly as regards neurological or heart disease.
On behalf of the alcohol, once again there are studies that the use of justice - one of the three daily doses - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
The regular use of a toothpaste can extend the life of a person even for more than six years, one study tells.
The claim is that this prevents infection.
On the other hand, they can help the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in man’s body.
The survey in Norway revealed how laughing had affected man’s life.
The seven-year project observed more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the test.
Sex, when gender protection has been taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
To gain extra years of life, a person should also receive orgasm.
I mean, it's not like it's going to be a problem. It's not gonna be a problem.
However, achieving a long life does not require absolute solidarity.
One study of Oxford University found that women with a large rear side had lower cholesterol levels.
Their body also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study combined these aspects with lower mortality.
Whether it's a athlete or an actor who won Oscar at the Olympic medals, he's more likely to live longer than a regular bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings more years of his life.
Some researchers, for example, suspect that age is due to a person's social status, which, on its own, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the behaviour of people over 65 years of age found that a person who was shopping daily, or likely to become a parent who was less likely to make purchases.
This is due to the fact that circulation in specific shops reduces loneliness.
It has once again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
So count your credit card with your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
The owl-dicker's ride went down the truck.
On Friday night, a heavy truck and a passenger car were hit by Koske.
The accident occurred in Koske, between the Koskents and Sorvastont on Friday at 9 a.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the passenger car received was driving along the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck went up, but it started to burn.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car went down to the stream, and from there, over the fence to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 who transported a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University Hospital of Turku.
The result of the female breath test was 2.02 promina.
He's suspected of a gross DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket's bulk selection was incomplete because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
On Thursday, Teija Haltia, who lives in the estate, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit my eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
If not, then, in the lawn cut, the sign reads it.
The ticking sign of the merchant is linked to the fact that the Posti extended its last spring services to also grass chops.
The grass cut is offered by Post until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly fun and decided to share it with social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a snooze.
Even media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this issue is amazing, but Haltia is wondering.
On Friday night, Haltia updated over 700 sections on Facebook.
Haltia got her favorites caught in a breeches bag, even though a few camps were empty.
Postin Kaideso, responsible for the business of transportation services of companies, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were misled yesterday in the wrong place (the Wall River) and we no longer left to do part-time (Salon) at three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first thing that's been news of the evening-Sanoma.
Teija Halti didn't get sore about the sign, because she found all her own breeches in the selection.
Humidiness! 30 kilos of light Lotta Backlund published a picture of his change
The Finnish producer has taken care of 10 kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost ten pounds as a result of change in life.
On Friday, Lotta shared a photo pair of her changes on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta had a gym and meant normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Kooman, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss career already in 2009.
He's a total change in life and he's been down a little bit by thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund published his flute performance on film pair Instagram.
The picture shows how huge Lotta has changed her appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after the film couple has collected a number of praiseful comments from the shopkeepers.
You're great, aren't you?
At the same time we're on our way, motivation is hard!
Pia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project now.
I get the strength and the zeal of your images when I'm on the same journey, the other one tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the project now.
At that time, he told the evening magazine that he wanted to reach a normal weight of 10 kg at that time.
During the three-month gym, kilos fell eventually.
Wish of a woman's family who was murdered in a horse: The victims' memories of police dogs
A week ago, the 42-year-old woman's family in Lovisa hopes that the victim would be remembered by donation instead of flowers and addresses for police work.
Sipoo Animal Health Station has published an Facebook update which conveys the wish of the victim's family for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked at Sipo's veterinary centre as well as had done his nurse's training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls women's touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and job intimidating.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds go to police dogs in their entirety, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old lady was murdered in her own yard of Lovisa in Koskenkylä.
She's been told by neighbors that the victim was very poor at night.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, and a flower.
A man who was 27 years old suspected of murder didn't know a woman, and they had nothing to do with it.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog named Börje, who was life-threatening in the arrest.
But the stock market survived and is recovering.
The law passed a judgment on infringements of the equality law to Post.
The Post did not have the right to arrest the employee who refused access to the staff member's salary, according to Kanta-Häme's judgment.
The rights of workers were ordered by Post to pay the worker the majority of the paid salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the staffer’s salary, which accounted for the share of the practice throughout the day’s work.
According to the law of law, the worker was set up in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the equality law.
The worker had followed the decision of the Union in the field of Post and Logistics (PAU) on the prohibition of access.
In November last year's Post Act, the PAU decided that Post's employees would not be familiar with the infringement of temporary workers.
The case was first discussed by the National News.
Turkey's return to a road that respects human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and respect for human rights development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipil (cent.) and by Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree with the situation of human rights in Turkey.
In his letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipil and Sonia to express their concern for freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putin fired the chief of his administration to replace the Estonian Nano
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned Mr Sergei Ivanov, the Head of President's Administration, reports the Kremlin.
Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will be present.
A former diplomat, 44 years old, has worked as Vice-President of the President’s Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax news office.
Vladimir Putin fired his head of administration.
According to the Kreml's information, Ivanov, which belongs to the close inside of the Putin, is moving to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed to replace Vaino, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union during the KGB spying.
Many considered Ivanov as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President before Putin re-election in 2012.
BBC: Manu's giant purchase for a game ban - is not seen in the opening of the Valioliiga
A world record man for football transfers will not be seen in the field when the English Valioli is kicked out this weekend.
Paul Pogba's playout followed him to England.
The Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the website of ManU's opening its league against Bournemouthi on Sunday, told the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society of Pogba paid EUR 105 million.
However, the British football union FA keeps him out of the game, for Pogba was left under a ban on gambling.
He received two warnings at the Italian cup last season, and it will become one game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England. FA told BBC.
The next seam of Pogba to play is the league in the second round of August 19, when Manu meets Southampton.
The Flow's got a lot of great madness.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established the Flow Festival position as an internationally respected event, which is being stared by world-class artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festar miners have typically expressed themselves by dressing up in their own way.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stowed with artificial grass and art installations.
We have never been enough to have a main boat and a beer, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Helsinki Suvilahti this weekend has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind this success: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go?
It's pretty different in the inactions to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of 700,000 visitors in the past year by 5,000 persons.
Even this year, there are a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because things to do must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd that is directed on vast roads.
That's not what we want.
Throughout 13 years of success, ideologicalism has been pinned down with 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area covered by artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller platforms, this year, 15 000 people are in the tent.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented even more easily.
Maybe I'm a bit of a big deal, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done today is that even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operation was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of approximately EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can lead to "creisquest cases", such as the construction of that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves by dressing up in their own way.
In addition to the music event, it is possible to talk about the trendy adult community.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled into particular fashion.
We want to separate ourselves above all with content.
Still, fashion phenomena fit Flow's world of values: curiosity and the desire to change with the environment, says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have the most typical performers on a pop-music, rapper and soul-combined festival.
According to Kallio, Iggy was called up because now is probably the last time this is seen at the show in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's done some damn good jobs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist parade bombs were hidden in flower bags - tourists fled in their horrors
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded at the local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs had apparently been hidden in a flower bag and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreign customers.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists started to leave the bars and return to their hotels, told Officer Samoer Yoosumra, according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wild animal protector, lived in Asia, made a picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show properly, you can look at it from here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin had foreign tourists.
The people were running away from me and saying that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest baraways, told the Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonblad.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of injured persons is not known yet.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one knew he was dead.
At the same time, there was another double-bomb strike in Hua Hini.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin, which had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the action of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been involved in the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This is part of the new rescue troops leaving in a war situation first to fight
In an acute war situation, emergency personnel are only ordered for battle duties after several months of taking military oath, says Central Finland.
According to the Chief of Defence Training, General Jukka Sonninen, who is interviewed by Lehden, for example, in a military situation of 5.5 months in service, only those who are at the end of their education are capable of fighting.
According to the Head of Education, the service will first be provided by reserve staff.
No backup or reserve staff shall be assigned to a post which has not been assigned the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces will begin training the emergency personnel for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used for military activities already during emergency training.
Pamela Tola got the big payments from the home house.
The actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, Pauli Waroma, has won a serious dispute about the apartment they purchased from Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of a two-storey separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house, which led to a dangerous growth of microbibs for health.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a break-in in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court, and then they asked the seller for a discount.
The salesman contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the court and the court.
The court judgment was given on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the district court in which the seller was ordered to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344.
The right justified the price reduction a little, as some repair needs had already been made known to the purchasers when making the dwelling sale.
However, according to court law, the mistakes in construction were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a decent home
Tola told us in court that the couple had specifically sought good homes because they did not want to go to repairs.
He was born with an idea that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the rehabilitation report were not affected.
The fitness check report mentioned as risks and inconsistency in ventilation and the lack of adequate management of flooding and melting water.
However, the discussions did not show that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma remained aware that the rainwater from the rock might need to be guided a little within a few years.
Goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the dwelling were much more thought to be more serious.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed microbiculture in the building, which the Witnesses believe was due to both the rock rainfall and capillary soil contamination.
On the west side, the air contaminated by the microbials could, according to the inspector’s assessment, also access to indoor spaces through the cylinder.
Healthy risk, above the limit values, were found in a plastic sample of home care rooms, basement stairs, living room windows and basement washrooms.
Steels were built without permits
The law also challenged the fact that the apartment was enlarged against a building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision taken by the City of Espoo prior to the trade, according to which changes had been made to the housing permit.
For example, steels had been built, although there were no suitable permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
On the basis of the information received from the seller prior to the sale, the right of court was to assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for measuring repairs in the near future.
Tola and Warom had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The purchasers have not failed their obligation to report, and the court has ruled in its judgment.
The harsh archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to their children in the Nazi register - also Finnish
Editor Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article in Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives of Maryland in the United States contains documents on microfilms for a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women as well as 31 Swedish women wanted Nazimorsiam.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-Germany racial agency.
The racial agency was acting under the responsibility of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
None of the SS men in Nazi Germany were allowed to have children before they had been examined by a SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to bear more than 10 children.
Andersson said that gynaecological investigations were conducted in women to find out.
The racial agency examined women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Agency a hand-written lifeline, as well as good recommendations from close relatives.
The racial agency wanted guarantees that women were "children lovers", "sustainable", and "good national socialists" who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of the SS men.
The case does not mention how 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents were found.
The SS leaders created a state supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme provided for, among other things, that every SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside of it.
Lebensborn homes provide for children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not promoted very actively, the website of the American holocaust.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The honorist of the German mother was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "aryans" and "non-Aryans" were legally prohibited, found on the pages of the museum.
On the sixth floor, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed in third sailing at Finnjoll's first departures at the Olympic Games in Rio, but remained on the tails of the day at the second leaving.
Nirkko rose in total circumstances after the eighth five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
The wind of Pettaja-Siren fought for RS:X class day departures in 17 and three places.
In the overall situation, Petaja-Siren is sixth.
Jonah and Niklas Lindgren, 470, remained in place at the opening of the day 23.
In the overall situation, Lindgrans are in place 19.
Jari Sillanpään Satunna was recorded at night for a few hours: "I was so in a canoe"
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
The Sillanpea, who has been the best selling soloist in Finland, and who has been the star of dance boards and festivals in 1995, continues to embezzle and is currently in a pecky lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, told about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää describes his life and career as good as bad.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total rise in his victory on the Wallo River Tango market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang dances, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamä had written to Sillanpää, at the request of a man, a tango piece, which Kassu Halonen agreed in a slightly different form.
The saturna song became one of the most popular songs in the history of music in Finland.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpea sang it on a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so in the canoe!
The man's head is in the book.
You don't think that it's been sang in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically best, the trail was good.
I learned that all the time, I don't have to ask myself to be perfect and high.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of the man, mentioned in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner and the case finally ended with the texts of the gold piece that was published as single in 2014.
The book states that the songs ordered from Sarah Tõmä were not like Sillanpää would have liked.
His head had imagined himself making a record telling the truth about his own life, but the words of the separate song were not true, but written on the news of 7 days.
In the news of the magazine, the reason for the divorce between Jar and the ex-loved one was reported to be Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jar said it was a full butt, and it was not true.
According to the book, she called the record company in rage and refused to sing the song, but eventually she ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting out of the EU for their kingdom.
At the end of the day, 52% of the voters were in favour and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the poll polling of the voting week predicted the opposite result.
The British Economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in the EU's position.
No recognised research institute or university did sign up for a divorce, although a few individual researchers were allowed to disagree with their profession’s power stream.
The theme "It's the economy, the stupends" of the former President of the United States in the Brexit vote in Britain.
The Economists were shocked when their voices didn't belong.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the main policy issue.
Economic Kiharaki
The Centre for Macroeconomics tiva in its latest monthly survey of professionalities answers to the Brexit disaster.
The answer is that the economists were not listened because this time voters decided on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of the economic loss of the economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the right British.
Many people also have the idea that the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist Committee, the voters did not believe the economic arguments because there was insufficient consensus between the Economists.
In particular, they were drawn by the BBC's equity, which provided as much space for only a couple of percent of economic scientists representing the EU's eco-economic community as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hostile press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE would think about the consequences of the difference.
These far-reaching combinations of letters spoke face to face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both heard and understood, they were not cared about because economists represent an elite with whom the voters, in their own view, do not share common interests.
The academics like the Economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigrantism is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, immigrants congeste your hospital, immigrants use you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In every waiting room at the health center, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical hours if they weren't there?
Every school has children, too, of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get to school if they got rid of them?
Foreigners live in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they went away?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists did not succeed and, if they did, they did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the British public finances and their consumption generate jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund made up for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by the Finnish Pertti Vanane.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory for the EU-wide camp, started to be prepared in greater detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a lie.
The problem was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
In normal terms, real estate funds do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Aberdeen's only open daily listings of the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15% and 20%.
At that time, the value of the fund was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is around £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanane of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest cash rate in these funds was 10% or even below it.
In other words, real estate funds made provision for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the deal
When the EU-wide camp won, Europe went nuts.
However, less than two weeks of voting on the real estate market were quite calm, says Vanane.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, real estate funds, the first, Standard Life, frozen their trade.
Together these robberyed the situation and brought the issue to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, says the Old One.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and after that, the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it had to be frozen for six days too.
According to old people, they did not actually close the deal, but they changed prices downwards.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it because it would cost you.
It calmed the situation, and most of it canceled the announcement.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says the Old One.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such damage in the Aberdeen Manner European funds.
But there was a lot of questions.
Inadequate attention to real estate funds
According to the old man, the closures of real estate funds were too much.
The open funds for closures account for about four per cent of British real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still stuck.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds to half of 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been cut down, but the situation does not seem "more" to Aberdeen.
The main issues now relate to the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, the Old One points out.
The price per pound and dollar is at its lowest for 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the period before the Brexit vote.
The dollar player can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, says the old man.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
Two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem so much.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanane, in charge of real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, came up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, and Vanane says in her second home in Helsinki.
He was headed right for work.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office supported the news, and people usually silently listened when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell us about his separation.
When the market opened, the screens flashed just red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live, Old One says.
Not because, despite myllerry, Aberdee, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate stores on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of peaceful, says the Old One.
The Brexit vote started the repair shop
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pun collapsed, the British leader broke up.
The market was expected to anticipate a sharp fall in the British real estate market, especially London.
Up to 20% of mines were anticipated in offices in London in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days, too.
Now the mulch has broken down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer vacation days this week on the face of the Old Age in Helsinki.
He thinks it's far too early to say a lot about what Brexit follows.
So much is still open: how the difference takes place and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been the first ever.
The CBRE data of the real estate service company on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, London's prices for all properties decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the negative was 6.1 per cent, read by the Old One.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only in five months there have been fewer figures, says the Old One.
All similar drop occurred in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared quite quickly with the global economic crisis that started on Lehman’s property market and the US real estate market.
In the old opinion, the parable is not very good, because it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another tunnel, too.
The real estate market has now not seen panic sales like that, but is willing to sell to improve liquidity, says Old One.
You can also find the financial jacket in a normal way.
The repairs could have been in the front anyway.
As a matter of fact, he's not a miracle in the price correction business, which could have been in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of properties in London and other world cities in the first century have been too high.
We've been saying for two years that City, and in particular the offices, are overrated, Old One says.
So the fall began very high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has London's population.
Another big trend is that properties are the last category of ownership that globalises, Old One says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have become available, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target known as the city.
In addition, prices have fed low interest rates, which, for example, pension companies have had to look for revenue from new destinations.
There has been an easy access to this loan - although the debt gap has been used by Old Man now clearly less than during the boom preceding the crisis in 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price rises were set up last summer, says Old One.
Aberdeen too began to reduce his holdings in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of translation that was expected, and now it came.
What's it gonna be?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the Old One.
There's a lot he's afraid he'll be willing to assess, but he's saying that I don't think there's anything uplifting going on.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a descending or smooth going ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down because he has been in the real estate since 1988.
And he's still optimistic, and he thinks the holes are going to work.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're better off.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in a single market, there's too much of a victim.
If you've broken up, the risks are also decentralized, says the old man.
The S-group will start to register shopping details more precisely
The S-group knows what you eat, because today the Group of Commerce has told us that it will start gathering more accurate information about their customers' purchases.
As information has so far been collected from the final amount of the receipt, the group will start to miss the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-group comes after Kesko here, because the information on the goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years now.
According to Ismo Riital, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has mainly been positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and is used for marketing purposes on an authorised basis.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
Time and time the customer has denied the use of product information, Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S-group registration change.
Kesko already classifys its client according to the mere purchases of meals into ten groups.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
The data are used for the marketing targeted to the customer.
Product-specific shopping information is collected only from the K-group's own chains.
The partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer program and does not have one of these plans.
In the immediate trade in Finland, Finland has its own Onesbonus customer program, which can be associated with in Valienta, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group-level data, we will remain at the balance level of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made in the store, and on the day and the final amount of the client's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level of K-group or S-group, says commercial manager Anu Ora.
In the future, he said that it would be a good idea to reform the customer's programme, but the Middle East will be later discussed.
However, Ora does not allow the registration of product information.
Initial trial
To date, SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively large.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information includes occupation, education, housing and the birth years of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase of S-Date cards has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, place, balance of purchases and method of payment.
In addition, data from S-bonus partners have been obtained from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level shopping data will be recorded in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have had a longer chance to focus more on marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of customer owner and partner activities of SOK.
The S-group says they'll be informed about the change they've made to their customers.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in cats, whether it was wanted or not.
You can check your stored data on the S-group website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila pup is Customs's latest dog confirmation - the penny becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador’s puppy is entrenched at the Helsinki Airport with the same five boxes placed in the same land.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
The Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
In the box next to Heila was sitting next to it, there was a jar of scented seals that smelled like grid gas.
Ruuti gas is the first smell that Heila and has now been trained, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online trade
Heila is the first specialised dog in the search for weapons and explosives in Customs and is placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
Work may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossings and ports as well.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
Following the attacks in Paris and Brussels, measures have been strengthened in Customs and controls have been confirmed, says chief inspector Mikko Grönberg of Customs.
The second is access to training for weapons and explosives dogs Customs' duties are mailing through Helsinki Airport.
With an increasing internet trade, up to 40 million mail is sent annually through the airport, including arms and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, Customs has made purchases of Internet commerce, baggage of passenger machinery and cargo of approximately 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source materials.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be looking into recorded baggage and mail.
In ports there will be great benefits in future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on his performance, Customs estimates whether more weapons and explosives will be trained in the future.
Grönberg looks forward to thinking.
School at the church
Heila puppy education is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonum.
Suntio also visits Heila to train with police and defense experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and in the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs and money and drug dogs in Customs, Massi.
Labrador extractor Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog that is to be selected for the airport include a rip-off and hunting spell, as well as calmness because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the Suntion home, is a close friend of work for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing gets home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from the disposable box.
The night cameraman loses the camera’s mic shield for a quick dog, but Heila returns the soft toy immediately from the "irti" command.
Hard competition from working dogs
The initial training of Heila will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, which assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can see work at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, passengers can't come to smooth the working vests on the dog, reminds us of Suntio.
The costs of one working dog are around EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they will retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active participations can only last from 10 minutes to two hours.
Work dogs are owned by hard competition in Customs.
Heila's owner sought about 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntion, who has never had a work dog before, but has years of experience in dogs as well as in supervisory duties in Customs.
The Mini State got its first Olympic medal - the people get their day off
From the Olympic gold of less than a million inhabitants in Fiji, Rugby is so highly valued that the government has ordered August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcasting company, the Fiji Government confirmed the matter once the championship was resolved.
We'll have the day off for our team home the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in his home country.
The Fiji Rugby team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian tells us that in the country the finals were followed in Suva, where a screen was set up for the stadium.
Normally, only the natives of Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, I heard them encouraging, said Fiji Times journalist to Makele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnishman fainted after the performance of the wild
The printing team Milko Tokola succeeded in his last venture after a hard battle of 175 kilos.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has several times passed out.
No one really could say why.
Tokola got 175 pounds of work and 145 kg of press work in Rio.
He had a total impact of 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get her job in the last five hundred and fifty-five pounds, as well.
By the third attempt, the weights rose in a fear of screaming.
The box was scratched by weight until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish overseer was afraid of the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has been acquired by Estonian hunter Prosan - Veiksikaliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ballo Society in the football league of men has made a lasting agreement with the Estonian-smoker Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We're looking for our team's top tracker with power and a threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
More than ten players and I went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
The release of the small silence began as a good alternative to Prosa, Coach Juha Malinen, who was coached by RoPS.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, taller than Flora, where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Wall River, where the Rovaniemen meet the ruling Finnish master SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, the rural king of last season, moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family Star is once again matching: Teen Star shorts reveal almost everything
A modern Family comedy, dear Alex Dunphyna, has become familiar with Ariel Winter again by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week at mini-hors, who won't leave much for imagination.
Shorts exposed not only the actors' legs but the back of this.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and use much more courageous.
The star has been poking in his social media images in very little clothes and taking numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to dress in very tight costumes.
The Winter at the hands of eternity has recently published several images of itself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image of publicity so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was in the process of "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
He's been on TV for almost his entire life and grew up in the age of the Cardashians.
He has learned that the more he shows the surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen with countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family Series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has pissed off part of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he is in ten years' time, when the sublime is already about hard, states a woman on Winter Instagram.
On the other hand, some of the women's fans defend the actor and call on him not to care for criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what everyone else says.
You're inspiration for a lot of women. You're exhilarating a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordics to Finland - tourists are attracted to the revon fire: In autumn it is possible to see a random monster aurora.
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the renunciation journeys from the beginning, according to Visit Finland.
Inari and Levi are the main destination of the Japanese renunciation.
Reton lights are the art cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly connected to the heart winter and lush landscapes.
In the winters of Lapland there is a great deal of demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
Few people know that the retreat season begins early in the autumn and continues far to spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see so-called monster aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revue lights making a vision of two times random, reports Visit Finland see. marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland's main destination group is wealthy 25-35, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and University of Turku and Tokyo researchers, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese needed clearer unique sights from Finland, and according to Lind, there is huge potential here.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown more than others in the Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double their nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain is satisfied with the master class of rugby silver Fidi, leading to gold
The United Kingdom's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed Fidz's final challenge at the Thursday evening final when the team experienced 43-7 crushes at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master class to handle, bite, ambush, support, running, and silk when he won the gold, their first Olympic medal.
With the kill came a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third British day - and they could be proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby opening tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 victory of the former semifinal on the same day in South Africa could have plagued them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a 15-person team in this condition.
Perhaps Britain - but probably not - will comfort you that at least one British has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former English boss from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a British trip.
Eight years ago, they trained Ryan to lose every game in the Adelae tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This spine hurts, but progress is alarming.
Fidi started excellently to combat British bonds for interest.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running on buses, and world champions led 5, after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner of the goal zone.
When the clock had four minutes, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great tactics stopped the man-year-old Leone Nakarawa from doing the third goal, but it was just slowing down for Fid.
At seven minutes jasa Veremalu made the goal at the right angle, and Britain was 17-0 at the loss.
Nakarawa made the goal again from a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock...the first half-time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the United Kingdom of Great Britain's discovery of the coats and climbed the line to make a goal.
After the paint kick, the situation was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And this is actually the case.
On the break, the United Kingdom made a dozen changes that dwindled Fid's dam for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova scored Fid's impressive feed game.
Dan Norton took a goal for the United Kingdom when he made a goal in the left corner of touchdown and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the viewers.
It was hard not to admire Fid's gloomy approach.
Mata Viliame's paint last minute was a peeling in Fid's cake that didn't need to be peeled.
The joke was drawn, the Feds hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely beaten.
Earlier on the same day, Fidi had hit Japan’s semifinal 20-5, and the United Kingdom won the game in South Africa’s tight semifinal, where each made one goal - British goal.
Kyle Brown took South Africa in the first half of the year, but Dan Norton crossed the goal zone with a dazzling foot job and scored under the paint poles in the second half.
A great late battle from Marcus Watson, the brother of the 15-aside-rugby team in England, secured victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer was tied to Helen Glover's and Heather Stanning's win-win.
These races will not have feelings of more pompous gold, and it really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 heavy races towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the deeper meaning of the golden moment in Estacio da Lagoon.
Although they went to the two of them, there were three votes on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' neck was present all the time, while the two of them were fighting for their second consecutive Olympic Games in the couple contest of women - the first women in the history books of British sports, which have reached such a achievement.
Their control was complete, and this was undefeated by their 39th performance, which is also recordable.
This, we see, two great athletes joining the surface of the swan's smuggle, does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
The background of each row is a group of helpful craftsmen who are gradually promoting the things that matter. And none of the pairs were as essential as a coach who did not know after 30 months of cancer diagnosis if he lived to this day.
Like he said, the situation was snotty.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could've been pretty bad.
It's gonna change your mind a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky that his treatment could be started outside the period at the beginning of 2014, causing as little disturbance as possible - if this expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
That encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
It's a long way to row, but it'll make it a little bigger.
Immediately after victory, the first couple of thoughts had Williams, who had had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Army's regiment of Afghanistan, said: "I've been a tunnel dream this week, which may be a little over-regulating, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how much I and Helen are, and Robin too, we have worked.
It's been three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he has great thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost competition in five years.
A couple set a tough rhythm that their competitors didn't hit.
Even at the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark's teams started to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very attached in a minute.
Helen shouted, "sit in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and we didn't try to do anything special at the same time.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we're just trying to win a good row and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years will wait before they decide on their future.
I mean, Gloria's gonna be at the wedding next month when she's getting married to a TV adventurer named Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was a Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was so stressed.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland replaces the government that has been robbed by the Panama leaks
In October Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections, which are already called for by protesters who have been furious with Panama's data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panamanian papers revealed a number of tax havens that have been circumvented by Irish politicians.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold a new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the latest rage of the people will affect the election result of the autumn.
In June, criticism of the rulings was clearly evident in the presidential elections, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected president from outside the policy area, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
United States Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled his latest speeches.
He said he was being sarcastic, claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate for the establishment of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was mad at what it said and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink down about your own Clinton receipt.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a bourbon-sucking dress with swimming beaches, including the British newspaper Guardian.
Mayor David Lisnard's decision states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a good way and a self-respective swimsuit.
The decision also states that swimming costumes, which greatly express religious links, can increase the risk of order disturbance in France, which has been targeted by terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men associated with Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the swimming water in the Oulu Region passed through the seul - the blue seams in the lake of Pykösköstö
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue seams have been observed on the riverside of Põykösärv.
During Tuesday and the middle week, the environmental action in the Oulu Region took samples of water from nine EU and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and gastropod enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were lower than the operating limits given in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal coke in the sea basin were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The water is not yet undisturbed, but in favourable circumstances the situation may quickly change with the presence of blue-green slabs on the surface of the water.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through enhanced inspections.
In case of changes in zinc exposure, this shall also be reported separately on the bathing track notification table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples from here.
MKT's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: more than 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest supply is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a reduction in taxes on the basis of the gift tax on the exchange of generation of forest space.
In the presentation by the Ministry of Finance, the reduction in forest supply has four objectives: promoting generation exchange of forest farms, increasing the age structure of forest owners, increasing forest size and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the net capital income of forestry.
Above all, the idea of a tool such as to promote generation exchange of forest farms is good, commented on the Central Association of Agriculture and Forestry Producers (MTK) Director Juha Hajarainen.
However, it is likely that there will be criticism of the tax change.
The reduction in forest presents a task of pure income on forest owners' capital.
It is a return on capital that has been reduced by all other reductions.
According to MKT and Haksrainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be higher if a reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The VM's proposal leaves behind by reducing the net income on forestry to prevent the loss of forest income which should be reduced by other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from tax even if there were no trees.
The model of calculation is too complex.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model applies only to small parts of forest owners.
The limit on the tax reduction linked to the forest yield is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's drawn too high for Hakkarais to think it's too high.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were excluded from the reduction line.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the objective of increasing the holding.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been carried out according to Hakkarainen for decades.
Its background is the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MKT, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful sleigh surprised the carmen at Himanga, two cars smuggled into the stream and ran into each other.
The fish river Himanga experienced a special chase on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two consecutive times the car went down into the stream, after which it came into contact with the driver.
According to Harri, the sun mate's fireman, the river's narrowing is suspected to be a powerful raid.
There were two people in the back of the car who were both transported to the hospital.
There's nothing more specific about their injuries.
The driver didn't get hurt.
The accident occurred on highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from Turku University researchers can help develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
Professor of Academy Johanna Ivaska's research team shows that the hardness of cancer increases the level of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells, as usual, grow in this environment.
According to Ivaska, growth of cancer was prevented in laboratory conditions by returning the surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer therapy may be improved by focusing on cancer cells as well as interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study have been published in the Nature Communications published on 4 August in the field of cell biology.
The suit of family death in Muhos continues in court, the prosecution demands a murder sentence for another person.
The ticking of the family death of the muhos continues in court for both of those sentenced to death.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home death in Muhoks.
For eight years, the second one received four months of killing and gross robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also sentenced to a serious threat to road safety as a young person and to the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The prosecution, the lawyers and the man who received the tougher sentence complained about the trial.
The prosecution requires a less guilty man to be sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for murder as a young person.
At the time of the act, they were fully understood
According to law, 17 - year - olds killed a man who worked as director of a school home for child welfare services last July.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the director who was sitting behind the living room couch, according to the grounds of the judgment.
The director had got rid of the sample and tolerated a young person to his room, when another young man hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten, and kicked into the head, among other things.
According to a mental study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from home at least since the day before.
The ice shark is the world's longest vertebrae, only growing at 156 years old
The world's longest live vertebrae is an frozen shark, reports the research published in the Science paper.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, the vault can live up to 400 years old.
The female is only growing when she's 156.
The fact that it only grows a centimetre a year adds to the life span of the ice shark.
Only one species is known for longer than living ice sharks.
The investigators found their age by radio carbon drive.
Due to the 1950s nuclear tests, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
For the oldest time, 392 years were estimated, though a throw in the direction or one can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Visa - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all tax revenue from the State would not be received if Donald Trump’s change in corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular as a result of the most profitable tax relief.
Trump described it as a revolution in his tax programme on Monday at Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
If we didn't collect it, we'd have a huge sum of $1,000 a year.
The upper income tax rate is now 39,6 after the reduction presented by Trump 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax completely.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation of business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The end-of-life environmental standards must be renewed and the energy regulation must be broken down.
The reform of Barack Obama's health care needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed as "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to the Trump, "above" trade policy is one of the major causes of the problems of the United States.
Free trade agreements would be shut down.
Imports from China were subject to a 45% penalty tax and 35% penalty tax from Mexico.
We'll offer you a new future.
America's event, not globalism, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the oceans, American steel will lift new skylighters all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully read the speech written by assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see the Trump program taking the US into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released his own program early on Friday in Finland time.
Attacks from the past - People's News
The sea is devastatingly mingling, but the actual wave of attack is hitting the middle of Madrid's street - the accounting with the past can begin.
It summed up the essence of the story of Pedro Almodovar's novelty.
The previous guidance work of Almodovar Travelers (2013) was a little fun and a rhino satirical comedy, before which I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish career.
Juliet (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a consistent, systematic love, human relationship and family drama with mother and daughter in the centre.
It's a simple story and it's a long way back.
Life seems to be modelled on the middle age titler (Emma Suarez), but then everything is threatened to fail.
In the later years of the random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of the Takaum and a long letter, Juliet once became her adult daughter.
He begins from the time before his daughter was born, the moment when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta will rise to the second part as a young teacher Adraina Ugarte, a TV familiar series between Ommeltte (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been handled in a way that she can think of as a cough, but I would say that time is sane and literally disposable.
For Almodóvar movies there is often a fair distance to such a characteristic shimmering.
It is a flatly exhibited, calmed, place in places with good music and a rather sad film with such ingredients for entertainment.
Instead, the Spanish director has a typical visual colouring effect and begins to put little quiet in his eye in a more pure shape than acting as a dramatic effect.
Diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains as high.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a nominee, you will change from scene to scene, and the same will apply to visible ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main issue, i.e. the viruses of the scene, is not more specific.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is external and little spiritual.
Almodóvar has produced a manuscript of literature in Nobel 2013 on the basis of three novels of Canadian Alice Munro.
Novellit has been published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat flat-rate written literature filming.
The substances would have been emotionally more intense than any drama, that much of the big things - especially the grueling guilt - about the topic of the movie.
Director and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Main sections: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film's first night at 12.8.
The government is trying to make an election - People's News
No new cuts are made, and the ministers are saying so that the basic Finns do not fall apart completely.
In the spring, however, the cut-offs are made.
No new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (cent.) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (Kok.) are under the budget line.
That is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's presentation, as social security cuts have already been decided in the spring framework.
Children's pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits associated with the National Pension Index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training operations continue.
The gymnasties haunt
Why are ministers so eager to stress that no further cuts are made on these?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipals will be held in April and will be the main heat meter in the parliamentary term, not the gallups.
It has previously been seen that the municipal result that takes the various sides of the government will ruin the government's atmosphere for a long time.
Gallupits, however, say that the government party's basic Finns are waiting for a rarity kill, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new delegates, many of them will be realised next spring at the cost of influence in the right-wing government.
The thread of life of the three political parties is about as large as that of the basic Finns.
It has not endured now, but more than half of those who voted for the vote had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs have also come to the surface of the Party's Parliamentary Group's visit.
First of all, no new cuts will come from the rhetoric, but the fact that next year they will be made fiercely and secondly, will be tried to soften the waiting attack on the basic Finns.
Major surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different... if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set a target for debt-responsibility in this parliamentary term, but next year, the Petter Orpo budget proposal will owe EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the gymnasties, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own agenda: indebtedness does not bend or even slow down.
One of them is to stick to the program.
This means new, even harder cuts on the former in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be based on a close balance during 2018 and then, in the spring, will be adopted in the Parliamentary elections as to what will happen.
The debt of these measures does not differ.
It is quite clear that indebtedness in today’s activities does not prevail, even though Juha Sipilä how to try a mild positive atmosphere.
Martti Hetemäen, State Secretary, at an information conference in Hetemäe's budget, is unanswered by the curves presented:
World economy growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. no aid for the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy of the early 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35 per cent and is on average prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now cost three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
With government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, reported weekly government debt will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt relief proposed by the left-wing industry was rejected as it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs approximately EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by a whole new debt.
This is the central concept of assembly and basic Finnish perception of what is responsible.
Question: There is much to be done for the municipalities
Three out of four feel that the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise of children is the responsibility of the municipality, as illustrated by the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also assume responsibility for individual municipalities for libraries, culture, citizenship, building control, high school education and waste management.
The municipality's responsibility is sought more clearly by the county plan, specialist health care, vocational training, higher education institutions and institutional care for the disabled.
None of the municipalities' duties under the order of order is to be transferred to the State.
The underage cyclist ran after the race and ran away from the police.
The 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu ran away from the police party on the Ilomantsinti on Friday night at half the time.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorbike without light, but the young man left to drive the police running from a fair speed.
The rear drive went on to the Sonkajarannant, from which to Sorronahotie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the way.
Even after this, a young man ran away, but a faster - leg police caught the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0,75 promina.
He also did not have a driving licence, which would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
This case will be investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell in the stream
The truck in the rock cargo crashed in the river on the Polvijärve on Kavinti Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had driven to the left in a curve out of the way and fell on its side of the river.
The rescue facility brought the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above the door, along with the rescue cell helicopter personnel and first nurses.
The lifting of the vehicle was left to the owner of the car.
The fallen truck poured hydraulic oil into the road, which was absorbed by the rescue facility.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in the Air River.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtikylä, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres long, tall, and handsome, with white hair under the jaw.
Findings and clues of lost movements are requested to call Põhjamaa State Centre's tip number 02954400513.
The ingredients of the big accident in the air - look at the gallery of Parafest's destruction
The impact flow of parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
The President of the Joensuu Parafestivistry, Arto Puppuri, estimates that the festival can be made economically and can also be organised next year.
The final performers of the Parafeste Kalle Salonen appeared on the market at the end of the Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the presentations held at the city theatre premises beginning at 13 a.m.
The Art Center at Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is planned to be held.
The flow rate is generated in a thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
The changes in the shape of the cloud water bind heat, so the descending air cools and its pace towards the earth rises.
The Institute of Air Science reports that there are multiple leaks in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route to access currents.
The sinking flow hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum at Parafest's location on Friday afternoon before the fifth.
Three tents fell off, about 200 people were in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly injured.
There was one child in the group who was transported with a slight injury to further treatment.
Air pollution ageing in London
Research has shown that the skin of the Londoners is getting older faster than usual.
The reason for skin ageing is air pollution.
The British research is about Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Cac analyses London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired people in London is two and a half years older than an elderly person living in rural areas.
The skin-deprived small particles are a very fine dust pollution, which is the source of transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, are almost 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who are walking on their business trip in the vicinity of congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example by various masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended for a more practical solution.
The tractor brakes betrayed the man standing in front of your ass.
The man had moved rocks in his yard by a tractor.
When he had risen from the tractor and went to see it, the brakes on the tractor were deceived, and the tractor passed on to the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to find a man who was seriously injured in the further investigations at the Central Hospital.
The tractor didn't get any further than that, because it ran into stones in front of him.
Riento with the latest strength for the coming season
The League-Riento, who is playing in the Airball Championship, leaves a series of better starting points in October than a man's memory.
The team's been together for three weeks already.
The joint song is found in certainty better than in previous years, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
As the head coach of the conflict, Jani Säisa continues to congratulate the new team on their attempts and unity.
In the foreign triangle, the middle storm Fred Muson begins his second term in Rietus.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who was in Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent hacker.
Garchet is a passari, a Brazilian has 198 cents.
Through the Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost in all the salibandy World Competitions since 2003.
Now the sixth race is going in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North America's Cars.
I was in Turku working and playing with women in this country when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a salibandy country team.
I'm interested, and here we are, Jumpmanen, 48, says.
The band was born in 1967 near New York in Elizabeth’s city.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen graduated from the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species was not yet played at the SM level as salibdy did.
They played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later I played hockey in Jokipoj on the marker series, Jumppane remembers.
During the year 1991-92, the jury played the salibandy’s SM series with the university, and the following three went to Josba.
When he played, he trained the company's A girls to the championship.
The women's SM series went up in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumpernen played through the 10 women's marker series, with a balance of 169 matches of 51+34=85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
The son of a bitch, Puska and Tatu Väänäen, was named on the national team.
The Josban of Joensuun Salibandy Society was raised by Perttu Puska and the Enolainen-based Tatu Vänänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team playing in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Ere, Helsinki, Pertu Puska, a 25-year-old, attacking Ere, has played this before six men's land fights, where he has gathered a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defenseman of Wiler-Ersigen, Switzerland, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the travel trail and is part of the standard equipment of the national team with 117 ground fights.
The national team was also named the Pancari player Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt at the MMs last December.
The head coach of the Salibandymaa team is Petri Kettune, a Contiolahtilainen.
Beach Volley Artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
Esti Hasu is about to end the beach volley player at least after a temporary season.
Beach volley Finnish Championships will be resolved during the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days medals are played in series for both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola, six of the best couples in each series will be eligible for the SM-final tournament.
The local color of the tournament represents Elimäe NMKY raised by Essi Hasu, who has belonged to Finnish beach volley for several years.
The Hasu, now living in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to see you this weekend.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for the nested stadium.
I haven't played very often in the series of adults in Kouvola, so it's great to play at the finals in the home corners, Hasu sensed.
The Kouvola region lit Hasu’s spark into sports and gave good meals to a fine hobby.
There are very memories of a child.
I started the volleyball when I was nine at Elimäe's NMKY's E-girls.
The top is too big toy shirts in mind, knee protections on the ankles, as well as huge chutes and coreographs after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small area, the sports club was a community where everyone knew each other.
The group's collective spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved... with the father of the teammate coaching us, and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasule beach volley was already a natural selection of species during the junior season as the counterweight of the indoor balloon.
There's been a bit of a song on the navigator's beach since the 1990s.
It's always been active.
I also went to follow the SM tour, thinking that someday I'd be there.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays with the pajamasman Anniina Parkkinen in the SM Financials.
After the tournament in Rikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second heavy twin is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still missing SM gold in the prize cabinet, but Hasu throws a mystery.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasu's familiar audiences.
At the beginning of September, new challenges will be expected in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, but Hasu is planning.
In the event of disabled people in Joensuu, the major accident was close.
The sink current poured three tents at the Parafest Festival of disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in an accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to the Karelian, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one big tent.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 17 a.m.
A friend interviewed by the Karelian, fireman Markus Viitaniemi, tells the newspaper that the situation had ingredients for a major accident.
According to the paper, the next event is at stake.

Solomon’s Koli went out to be a brave farmer.
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Solomon’s Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
The Koli began shortly two years ago, together with her little brother, Valtteri Kol, as a successor to their home space.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural operator meant indebtedness and an increase in order to allow bread to come in hand from agriculture.
It's been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy with the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think it has to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a yardwreck, and at first the bank was not excited.
However, I went to the project myself, and I have been fully involved, and Solomon’s Koli tells and adds that he would not have done it if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out well.
Solomon’s Kol’s goal is to invest even bigger cattle.
The work has produced results because Solomon’s Koli has been elected to the ten best groups in the competition for a young farmer of the Earth’s Future.
He's competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the website until 21.8.
Bulgaria will report inflation for the first time for eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when positive 0.2% was reported.
The average annual inflation, measured by cost index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to 12 months prior to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate from the beginning of 2016 (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothes and footwear (2.2%), furniture, financial supplies and routine supply (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as last month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's "name" effect is evaluated as Asian caricature type
According to Snapchat, anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
With its lens tool, Snachat allows around 150 million daily users to edit reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an anax, a dog or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The birds are simple, face-to-face tools that produce more than 30 million improved self-sufficient daily.
All delusions quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have been previously criticised for the fact that the application advertises a blackface mask or favors white-coloured leather as a beauty touch.
So when Snachat advertised it this week for some users in lenses that gave them the vibrate eyes, the vibrate teeth and the bully cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people, "the yellow face," or Yellowface.
And they're wondering if these repeated nemigences could be a sign of a company's bigger problem with diversity.
News and evil spread throughout the Wednesday with reports from The Vergen and Motherboard, the day later Snachat said that he had ceased to feature.
The company provided an explanation: The bird was meant to be a tribute to anime people, not a caricature of Asians.
But for those who were watching racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes of activity.
Others refused anesthetics to be nice.
In his e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student of art, who was widely distributed from the photographs of herite, said that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against the comparison with the most recent gross Asian caricature type and filter effects".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow fever, but that the yellow fever is exported to extreme debilitability.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all wear in our hands.
And the huge, racially diverse audience of Snapchat's parents can mean that they even more likely expect a understanding attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25 years old Katie Zhu said that when one of the Snachat lenses creates a user-infringing image, "it is much harder for these guys to be unnoticed".
Thursday Zhu, Product Manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snachat account and urged others to do the same.
In his letter to Medium and telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in the remuneration practices of Snachat.
Zhu criticised the company’s main white male leadership and decided to write it at the Hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#PastaSnapchat)
"If they do not have a wide range of skin color representations in their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions", the Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have different colour representatives at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint against which Snachat has largely failed to reply.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, stating its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snachat refused to discuss the racial situation of his staff, but the representative said that the company hired a recruiter to concentrate on under-represented populations and forward internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, in his own contribution, that he held his Snachat account closed, adding: "Do you think they really need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
According to Congress panel, military officials were distorting Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress panel said that intelligence reports from the U.S. military headquarters were designed to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than the events justified on the ground.
The Interim Report of the working party set up by the Republican President of the Defence Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Resources Sub-Committee found "low dissatisfaction" among the intelligence analysts of the headquarters, who said that their leaders were being confounded by the American efforts to win Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcomina, is the military headquarters of Florida Tampa, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs accepted by the higher-value Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorist efforts than the facts on the ground justified, which were consistently more positive than the analyses produced by the other elements of the intelligence community," the press release said.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our warriors are suffering when bad analyses are presented to high-value decision-makers," said Mrs. Ken Calvert, the California Republican.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reaches the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that high-value administrative authorities in Obama’s administration would have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts as if Centcom’s leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, Isis, in a more positive light.
" throughout the first half of 2015, many press releases, opinions and certificates from headquarters to Congress were significantly more positive than what happened itself", the report said.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that a major attack on Mosu could even begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Isis.
"After months of research, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, high-value intelligence leaders manipulating the intelligence outputs of headquarters in the United States military headquarters, thereby minimising Isis's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans, after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence about Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results in the course of the investigation.
The chief inspector of the Ministry of Defence has begun an extraordinary ongoing investigation into Centcom.
On Thursday, the members of the Bureau of Intelligence published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some Republican working group.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created a process that was too isolated for the intelligence of Isis and Iraq's security forces", said Adam B. Schiff, the chair of the Committee, in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence," a bad mood among analysts and "has not given enough space for different angles".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find any evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the Centcom analysts to settle their conclusions on "a pre-set or political statement".
The Daily Beat reports on Tuesday on the initial results of Congress investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the chief inspector of the Pentagon has started an investigation following the complaints of Centcom analysts.
In his statement, Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on Congress report as long as the chief inspector's investigation is under way.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other consequences than just the question of whether the US bombing measures in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the military response to Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis targets to the headquarters.
The assessment of the Islamic State's intelligence reflects more than a decade ago when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a study article saying that despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush's regime supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in rebellion regarding Islamic intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, the air strikes against the refineries controlled by the Islamic State did not significantly undermine the terrorist group's economy, since it had built temporary processing works to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
The Centcom Bridge Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was started to be criticised last year after many legislators held his testimony to the Senate as a more positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he replaced General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row with women's country hockey, organising an interview with the UK.
The day after having made three goals for the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made the US Women's Country hockey team two first goals for the Americans when winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he'd done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a book on his painting."
But this is what he knows: the Americans are in a 4-0 event in the Olympic tournament and they share their group first with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the first round of the final game.
Both teams have survived one quarter of the time, and this game will decide who will be first and who else will be their six teams in their group.
First placed to avoid a strong Dutch, second group leader, at the beginning of a slightly longer quarter-final.
Whatever the end of Saturday's game, the Americans have come up with a surprising success here, four years after they remained at the Summer Olympics in London for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Pennsylvania's Blue Bell and picked up the country hockey country for the first time when he was 3 years old (i.e. his parents double sister played the species in Drexel) and joined the national team when he was 16 when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same working hours in London as we have now.
We've done a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started his first half-time goaling near the finish line.
India had come into play with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the situation in the 1-0s until the end of the third batch when Bam took over the situation.
He transported the ball long from the left of the field to the center and then pulled the ball into the finish line, taking the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added four to the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the tournament's first U.S. goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs, who had released one goal for each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampolin peace in the middle of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are running.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to continue and to be inevitable, fiercely from the message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic threat itself is a flaming communication capsule, which is passed from a bow to a swimmer and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to put on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a conversation with a neighbor in a coffee shop without hearing about the hatred between Simone Bales, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympics' first-time and future heart breaker with a smile, could very well be one of the names of everyone that are known for their best viewing time, supported by sponsor contracts and TV ads of good mind - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from California Lake Forest, competes for the Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic leak doesn't light up all the species as much as it does.
Far from the center, in part in the shadow, are the species that are not generally accepted by all: air-pistolism, spring bomb, feather ball, taekwondo.
We'll always have breast-feeding. Long live it.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favours, I would like to draw attention to the weakened charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it first appeared in Sydney’s competitions, its presence in the past 16 years is so little that many of the people I interviewed did not realize at all that it was a Olympic species.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has not moved to the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russian usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China Dong and Canadian Rosie McLenna defend their gold medals in London.
Trampoliin, however, is accompanied by a certain kind of malpractice charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
This is where I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an incompetent fan.
The species have opportunities for pleasure, such as the coloring of the endless pops of the drawings, but also for gymnastics and swimming pools, two species, which are in principle combined.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "puncture board".
The champions of the championship jump with a giant trampoline up to 30 feet high, and they have to carry out the climbing business series (translations, skills, and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the Official Olympics programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The direction of the most common Olympics is straight ahead.
The people who wish to go for gold must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes until the goal, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are not only hunting goallines or starting walls, but also, on television news, on the other hand, a grueling border: World or Olympics.
This determined pursuit is noble, admired, and even fanaticic, and can even get a viewer in tears.
But that is also the reason why looking at the races can be a little tiring.
Trampoline offers a rest moment here.
Trampolin's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The contestant rises to a new rise, affecting the weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this does not affect competition or difficulty, but there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, not only the sleepful, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen space as you can get to the Olympics.
The women's fur contests and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at 13 a.m., the men's races will also come on Saturday at 13 a.m.
NBC sends finals as part of its afternoon software from 14 a.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic flute, they offer a quiet, charming moment, most likely not to be noticed in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by providing male athletes to be stared and objected (such as the American male conquerors suggested some time ago), Dooley is just waiting for his dazzling new fanry.
"The generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, a long - standing United States ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Political change in Ethiopia has faced violent opposition from the government.
The witnesses say that dozens of protestors have been shot to death in a conflict with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong West ally, whose economy is growing rapidly.
Over the last few months, however, demonstrations against the government have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
Just last week, thousands of people attacked the streets, demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was pathetic.
The witnesses said that the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protestors.
The spreadable, demonstrations recording videos that are believed to be at the end of last year or beginning this year show how security authorities are hitting young people while they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa, International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is Africa’s second most violent country after Nigeria, and Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country will get so much help from Western countries.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa has even a new train for tourists.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, while Ethiopia has not been a model for democracy, human rights organisations have kept talking about government oppression, the opposition of the country has been limited, and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far away from the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people and have no choice but to show their mind, this is what will happen", Seyoum Teshome, the university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth shows its mind.
One generation shows his mind.
Complaints are diverse and cover all forms of land abuse in the repression of the government of the coalition.
After a lot of critical elections last year, the ruling party and its allies became the last opposition, and now it holds all places in this House.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea are growing, and the battle that took place along the narrow and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, can try to use the exorcism and re-arme.
Many factors explain why bitter feelings are now about to explode after years of falling below the surface.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through the social media when the cheaper smartphones have become widespread and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through the network of hidden servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromas and the Amhars, are better able to deal with each other.
Oromats and amhars are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who came mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, using the Oromas, many of which are Muslims and who live on the low.
But this is changing too.
"We're on our way towards the organization of one umbrella," said the organ leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oroma districts.
Many Amhars and Oroms think that Ethiopia is an unfair rule of the Tigre people, covering about six per cent of the population and controlling armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors in making opponents harmless.
"The government has no basic sense like it," said Abdi, conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemaram Desaleg, was picked up as relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemaram is from the south.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bleeding.
For the last time, Ethiopia was under such a dirge in 2005, when thousands of people showed their mind about the elections which, according to analysts, seemed to have the government first executed and then robbed them.
In the event of an effective attack, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for the visional infrastructure design, such as the new business path, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
Clearly, though, this has not stopped the internal discipline of the Ethiopian government.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
In the last month, protestors in the city of Amhara, Gondari, attacked by Tigre-owned companies, and anger against Tigre becomes more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a position of covetousness.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for air flights to Somalia, although it recently said that it had closed this base.
Even though the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want their allies in an unstable area to collapse either.
"This," Abdi said, "it's real balance."
Donald Trump explains Obama-based Daddy his claim to be a "sacre".
Donald J. Trump attempted to suppress his latest campaign by taking over the dispute on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when this week he was a numerous storyteller, indulging that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "sounders" of the Islamic terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have been interested in defending him during the stormy period, in a difficult position where they have to explain comments that he does not necessarily mean.
After a presentation at the campaign meeting on Wednesday, Trump argued that the same was more and more intense at Thursday's interviews, where he inspired him to say that he was really meant to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
However, in the Twitter release of early Friday morning Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation from the previous day when Trump said that he had been in a number of interviews for a serious accusation.
When the conservative radiojourner Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump sneak his attention by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this hearable ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus its campaign in the middle of the opinion polling results that are falling into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject again.
Again on Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump's used sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, after he faced a broad criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remarks by saying "that is probably why I am sarcastic".
The approach will enable Trump to go back to political speech at the borders and then return, if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then "explains" in the direction or depending on the reaction of both candidates," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the use of the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is attractive to his statements and that he knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating their speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been more smuggled over the last few days when his popularity has continued to decrease.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Trump will cause Clinton to follow considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump, as a general rule, tries to avoid an apology for what he says about provocative matters, he often blames his critics for misconception of his words or for misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he encounters an ever closer examination during the last months of the presidential election, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies to a uncomfortable position in which they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former mayor of New York Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, saw a lot of trouble defending the candidate at a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that his words have real, political comments," Giuliani said, when he was asked about the reality of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that, before Obama Isis, he was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateurs, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops away from Iraq.
Most of the Republicans in the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama Government, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Pennsylvania's Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which perpetuate his every word and are partial to him.
He mocked "good, pathetic" TV experts who were trying to figure out what he was saying, "They won't make it!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for making a new piece of evidence that he was an inappropriate president.
A previously closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was corrupt, only a cash acceptive place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but who offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the street of Bedford Avenue cost it too much.
The movement that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup cake-shaped soaps.
The locals raped it as the latest loss in a middle-class town.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is a change, it's also a re-invention.
The survived Verb opened up to Greenpot in November, less than a mile from his original location.
In the new Verb there is a wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff still have the same feeling and there's the same inconspicuous atmosphere.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old coffee shop, which is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, had many things to do with it.
Verb used the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought new ingredients.
On the menu you can find bacon chicken cheese sandwiches, and you can find capris and fried onions on the floor.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the coffee shop, but there's fresh juice.
In nine months Rodriguez says he noticed a smooth flow of old stock customers.
"Williamsburg also cost many former customers too much," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these customers.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpot, he went to the cafe.
He says when Verb closed up, he gave up a coffee drink for a while.
"I understand I enjoy Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he's back in the coffee room, though on that day he ordered a chai drink mixed up instead of his usual ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to work there, and he always made the same order.
"Every day, fifteen more than seven, as regular as the clock, I went in and they were preparing the spices of my bagel with butter," he said.
Photograph. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients on the menu.
Today Rosenthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes because of the variation, he orders a delicious bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not carrying a grudge to a soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, Soap Cherien’s owners offered to produce a special soap for Verb, which would be used as a component of the cold coffee plant.
"I think we can still grab the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of GreenPov have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu aside, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it out for something soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other benefits.
The local juice shop wants to bottle up and sell some cold coffee.
It's possible that the coffee shop will expand into the next building.
Many customers have enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said it was a relief when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home walking in and ordering a coffee.
"I needed to smell it," he said.
A Square Metal: Diluting Food for the lay season
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office room.
In the sensitive direction, President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the hankhammer, and Maryland's turtle soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and a dessert from the plumb.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," Jane Ziegelman said.
His spouse, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life on the Lower East Side floor through his food book 97 Orchard.
Their latest cooperation, A Square Metal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they will meet with a reporter at the Sandwich Shop, a small, unflavoured lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been active since the 1929 stock exchange break.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese olive bread, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the journalist ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the recession.
"The furs were very popular," Ziegelman said.
It was peanut-murk, liver-murk, parum-hute.
They were made of the manufacturing material and some of the cheap ingredients that continued on the actual manufacturing product.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe's a bit of a joke.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
During the years before the recession on American tables, especially in rural areas, it was like a food-in-the-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served in breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The A Square Meal book chronicles the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a land of luxury.
"The food of the chairs became a key, troubling subject for the Americans," Coe said explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One troubling was a new, affordable diet: Mysterious food species, such as wreaths and boxes, became the main food, and the box was a "a powerful way to use food supplements", said Ziegelman, because the chefs were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat that had been in the middle of American meals for years became a product of luxury that was economically administered.
Special ingredients were tested with calories and nutrient content more important than taste or even healthy senses in the kitchen.
When conducting a study for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared a period of meals where fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
The peanut butter is no match for fried pigs.
This was inherent in many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office in 1923-1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Public recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraged women to begin as "budjeters" and to face the challenge of converting non-responsible sprays and bourbon-like bourbons to taste for dosages.
The A Square Metal is a party for historical taste.
The reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, allow me to eat your cake weapons.
At the same time as he publicly praised his childhood as a simple, iowan rural food, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in a almost golden dining room on top of him.
He was the greatest outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake unless his wife, Eleanor, encouraged him to be an example of his own stomach.
As is said in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered Washington's most busy food, but also the most densely prepared food."
Many of the lamanic eating habits were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
Our traditional focus on calories and nutrition is continuing, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, such as how she could not throw food away.
"He really was afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even got sick of people."
There was a windstorm incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the desserts they had prepared at home: the bone trace food that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a muzzle," said Ziegelman, adding that the general trick was to give a name that looks like modest recipes.
There was no cream foam in the dessert, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone deliberately drowned their spoons in a stained, brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sansed once and for the other.
From the sound of a positive budgeter, he told his wife: "A few smuggled German nuts could help."
Gilead will be compensated for legal expenses in the fight against hepatitis C patents against Merck
The U.S. Attorney General has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc be entitled to the legal expenses incurred in disputes against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc in relation to hepatitis C patient.
In June, Gilead was released from the $200 million payments after their infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s successful drugs in Sovald and Harvon, following the U.S. judge’s discovery of Merck’s abuses, which included false oath and other ethical practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, U.S. district judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensation that it suffered in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market in a generation of new hepatitis C medicines, which can clearly improve more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case will run until 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other to the court of ownership of the laboratory work on the basis of sofosbuvir’s active substance.
The U.S. forces say that they've taken control of Manbij, wholly controlled by Isis.
The United States-supported forces have taken control of the northern city of Manbij, near the border of Turkey, after the last remaining Isis fighters left town, the group representative said on Friday.
Syrian democratic forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 Savilipant prisoners, who were held captive by the fighters, from Sharpan Darwish SDF's ally, Manbij's military council, told Reuters.
"My house is now fully under control, but we have begun to examine it," he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return showing that the income of the President of the Democrats and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton made nearly 5.3 million speech payments, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his book about his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton Vice President, Senator Tim Caine from Virginia with his wife Anne Holton, published ten years of tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine set a standard for economic transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, campaign representative of Clinton.
As a dangerous contrast to this Donald Trump, he hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is the practice of the US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration's audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn", campaign assistant for Clinton, Ian Sams, said on Twitter when he published a link to the tax returns of the Democratic People's Party.
On Thursday, Special Agent Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audit is ready.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican dealers in 2012, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his transactions and numerous other links to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem on Fridays with a online video that produced prominent Republicans calling for Trumpi to publish its taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate for the last decades has done: he published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business column loaned on Friday to a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named by billionaire investor Warren Buffett to ensure that over a million dollars a year are paid at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska Omahasa last week, Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also had an ongoing audit of the tax administration, and that Trump did not stop the tax collection agency, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal rate of the Clintons living in Chappaqua in New York was around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax rate was about 40,5%.
Clinton’s tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Their main purpose was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton announced $ 109,000 in dividends and interest rates.

Chili powder condoms and ferrets contribute to the protection of Tanzania’s elephants
Naturalists in Tanzania are using an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking into the territory of people - they throw animals with a chemical powder filled with condoms.
The Keino has proved to be effective, and several years ago the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has improved its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Denmark to use non-violent four steps to protect homes and hundreds without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the World elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"From then on we have developed tools, we have found a change of attitude in these communities; they are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants off their fields without harming them", said Damien Bell, Executive Director of Honeygues.
The first two steps keep the display of an invading elephant with a flashlight and the calling of a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, you'll be thrown into a "chiili cloud".
The condom shall be filled with a mixture of chilli powder and earth, and then the condom shall be closed so that only the ignition thread remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it breaks down and chews the chilly powder dust into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last way to do this is to shoot a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.

According to the worker, this is the result of the "call" of Arab customers who are not listed by the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Claude Lanzmann, who made a Shoah documentary film about the Holokaust, gave his frustration to the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German FAO release.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel’s hotel in the country’s indicative number list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries where it can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via its own telephone station.
When looking for an explanation, the movie maker took the floor to speak at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer received from it was "discreeted him".
The doctor at the hotel said it was a "considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision caused even more stress on the film maker.
"The rest of our guests are Arabs, and they call for Israel's direction number to be removed," said the worker, according to Lanzmann.
German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "great misdemeanor", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were terrified and shocked because of the incident.
It's already a great mistake.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need to be explained.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident caused quite a reaction online when people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "sented" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
The second publication, which noted that the hotel in Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself challenged all charges quickly and called what happened "unscrupulous" as well as "secure forgiveness" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"It is the order not to include Israel in the list of quick selections," says Kempinski's representative, who has said that he has said according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the heading number has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubber sprays against Brazilian students showing their minds.
On Thursday, students gathered themselves together with the police in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, when they gathered themselves together to express their views on the reform of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber sprays against protestors.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to break down the student force, which led to police using rubber holes and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror of plans.
According to Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, Governor of Sao Paolo, little less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of those involved in the demonstrations were seen writing graffiti against provisional President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protestors moved out as one of the groups to support President Dilto Roussef's Senate in voting on his office.

After the removal of the packages, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says Ambassador of Russia in Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have ceased, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
One of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is the expansion of trade," said Dzhagarya.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the net sales of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 to a total of USD 856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran rose by 91.5%, representing a total of 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 per cent to $158 million.
"The growth of the city was achieved by the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagarya expects a record this year of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation in Iran granted about 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also the first among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that the record of Iranianists in Russia last year will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians visit Iran, which ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Skotit Callum Skinner hit the finish line on the British bikes.
Last night, Scotland's Callum Skinner praised the men's team print at Rio's cycling stadium, when the British team's trio defended its championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his sister-in-law Sir Chris Roy, who was proud of the young one when he challenged the victory of winning the goal from the New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock win four years ago, while Hoy won his fifth six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick with modest investment in the sixth World Championship of March in London, even though Hoy has subsequently decided to compete.
The problem between Beijing and London's races was the replacement of special transmitter Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from whom British trainers held on to the score of potential, which is now a story.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner did the Olympics in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British Third won a duel for gold.
After his own tour, he was just behind him, but Kenny put the team in charge, and Skinner held it up.
The strategy change was a major part of the transformation, and it included Hindes' drive at a major shift in order to slow down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to hold onto the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the award coupon.
Twenty-three-year-old High-year-old Skinner said, "Breathing is inspiring."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We played the Olympics at the finals and won the world champions.
I can't believe it.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindus admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after the bad start.
He later pulled his comments back, and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with overpowering gain.
Hires said, "It felt like he was in London when he had so many British tickets."
As a team, we found contact in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply great.
One event, one gold medal for the people, who won seven out of ten bikes in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to succeed for five days on a cycling stadium.
According to Kenny's record, it's not impossible at all to imagine him repeating Hoy's career, winning three Olympics in one of the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny, who is 12 years younger than Hoy, was also born on 23 March (it is likely on the sacred day of British sport, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - the total number of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny's next competing for a sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I now only like this one.
The team race is always the best.
We'll win it together with our friends.
To win alone is to be honest with one another alone."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should give him the value of the knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and the Owin Doull were the fastest four, four-mile team in time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London 2012 the world record won gold is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with judges yesterday before the time-limits when officials invited him to the length measurement.
In the same women's race, which goes on and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavivi Katie Archibald made progress in the world record at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great cyclist team takes over the middle of the Olympics and reaches the entire set of medals.
After a really exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before Rio's competitions.
There has been drama in the background, the least of which have not been the difference between the technical director Shane Sutton, in April due to sex and temptation charges, and the end of the rivalry of big people, such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on first-night competitions at cycling stadium, it seems that now the legendary reputation of the UK rises to its peak at the perfect moment could be once again true.
The smooth future of Portland because of the cutting of the electricity contract
The future of Portland's aluminium alloy, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the owners of the plant is about to conclude a distribution agreement, so there is a waiting time for all distribution contracts to be cut.
The measure follows earlier this year’s decision by Victoria’s administration that the aid required to keep the plant in operation will not be continued.
The 20-year period of aid will end in November.
Even 2,000 jobs may be in danger at the Alcoa Portland factory.
Even 2,000 jobs may be in danger, directly or indirectly, due to the closure of the factory.
In addition, snowball effects can be possible, as the melting industry uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's meltdown, which led last year to the closure of Anglesea's power plant.
The Alcoan Portland smelt loses money and is under the threat of closure.
The measure now follows a number of years of speculation about the future of the factory, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of manufacturing the factory.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium alloy from the Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects its three other owners to conclude their agreements.
Most of the factory owns the Alcoa and Aluminium association, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects Portland factory to continue operations, which means that the unfrozen physical electricity demand will continue," he said.
According to AGL, contracts are so-called 'protection agreements', which were to enter into force in November 2016.
These agreements have 12 months’ notice of termination and will therefore effectively end in 2017.
"For this reason, AGL expects contracts to produce results in 2017", the electric company said.
All possible results for AGL from the accounting year 2018 are currently limited by strong prospects for wholesale electricity markets.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounting for $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "has no effect on the Alcoa's ability to hold a meltdown in operation or to secure the free electricity supply".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that it had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew.
Analysts have been equipped with both the Portland alloy in Victoria and because of the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier in the week, the director of AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts that Portland uses some 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago is about 900 megawatts.
"If both factories leave the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
For us as an electricity producer this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the true TV star of Kardashian, is on the cover of the Vogue of September
Kendall Jenner, 20, the model and mother-manageri Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan's fourth daughter, are on the cover of the United States Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and was modeled at Milan, Paris and New York's fashions, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"To look at this deck in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover broadcast was followed by a unique (or perhaps only Kardashian style?), handwritten reality video, where the whole Kardashian-Jennerin clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with all the favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of his sister, but which ended up in a classic version: they even designed a surprise party.
This is the cliché of nearly every child's TV series's "born-day" series (Seacrest says in the words "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-designed pupils), but Kris had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we are sure to have moved to the new Kardashian era with the place of the Vogue in September.
Kendal’s Isosko Kim may have arrived at Vogue’s application first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is exactly his own class.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness resembles more coffee table books than fashion leaves, and the number attracts an enormous number of promoters (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832 page op.).
Its cover is expected that for the last two years the images of the magazine have been leaking before the official publication.
Previous women on deck have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evans, and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more "publicists operating as models" than "models that are famous".
Oscar's winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on deck in 2013, after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, the magazine describes his generation as "a mint model", would hit his first category, he's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or young people today who can make a good Snachat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model, Beyonce, has been one of the strongest years of his career with Lemonade's publication.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
His true-tv history, Jenner's position in the fashion world, will always be a tad.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and this colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "this moment's bitch".
This feeling rose again with Jenner Vogue.
But turning around in dissatisfaction is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications that are found behind the payment wall.
He sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter who he took to the LOVE magazine.
And in his leisure time, perhaps just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he is a true TV star.
Community judicial centres turn 160 000 people away every year
The most vulnerable of more than 160 000 people will be turned away annually from the legal centres of the Community as the sector prepares for the effects of additional financial cuts on its operations at extreme limits.
In Queensland, three out of five - mainly of the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair mischief and similar - are already turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already devoted to the Community's extreme borders are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
According to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report, thousands of people are already converted annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only worsen.
"Queensland's legal centres are chronically under-funded, which means that thousands of people are turned annually away from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and tiring debts, families who are homeless, workers who are unsatisfied - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not need the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will have to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brands to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made a commitment to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Centre for Legal Affairs and their customer communities, and the Palaszczzz Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the worker was claimed to be armed.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for not doing anything after they were told that the Chief of Action of the campaign in North Carolina threatened with a gun in February while driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in the state campaign by former software intern Vincent Bordin in Charlotte, State Court, on Wednesday.
Bordin said that he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that "this would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "moved out the pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed Vincent's kneecap," Bordin said in the action.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other people had similar experience with Phillip, said in the complaint.
"There's no need to launch cases to cause damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The challenge will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "a second increase in people", which would normally be understood by the gun owners and armaments, could take action if his competitors Hillary Clinton were elected and should be elected judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word out of the context and that he is not in favour of violence.
The challenge of Bordin is to seek compensation from the campaign for reckless supervision and for the violence, assault and emotional shock from Phillip.
Hope Hicks, representative of Trump, did not reply immediately to the request for comments.
They didn't manage to reach Phillip.
WCCB, the local newsgirl company in Charlote reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
His consultant’s request for call to Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is against Bordin against Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery from the whole stomach, not only to local communities and beyond London.
For myself, this was the great charm of Heathrow, as was the charm of the London 2012 races, when we saw enormous effort to ensure that all our peoples and territories would benefit from the competitions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new placements and 40 000 new jobs are created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment is removed from the airport.
Just as before London's 2012 races, some will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not only for few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and an economic growth of GBP 211 billion, as well as to leave the heritage of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has carried out an infrastructure investment programme of GBP 11 billion in time and budgeted: from T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world in five years in a row, to T2, built between the two most pressing runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by £16 billion private money.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, to ensure the future of our trade and to create a heritage of skills and employment, from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Minister of Finance.
Preventing advertising in Adblock Plus and Facebook cats and mice
For companies who get money from online advertising, companies are passing away the "kiss and mouse play" program, said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog writing that said that users can update the program filters to prevent advertising on the social network pages again.
Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its website is exchanged around ads to make it harder for advertising inhibitors to see which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's been orbiting a new code.
In the blog writing, the representative of Adblock, Ben Williams, wrote that “this kind of and long-term fight between the community that prevents advertising of open source and its evaporators has been in progress since the discovery of advertising,” and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much sorrow has become for industry as a result of the prevention of advertising.
Globally, around 200 million people are using advertising inhibitors, reported last year's Pagefair and Adobe research, which is nearly four times the amount of these programmes that used in 2013.
1,03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company is after advertising inhibitors on the computer because mobile advertising inhibitors do not operate on Facebook's mobile applications to the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer advertising is still producing enough revenue to make Facebook’s view of the investment of this kind of activity.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its "promotion" tool to give people more power over how to target advertising for them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying, as they would also prevent part of the site’s content from being non-reciprocal.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," said the Facebook representative in the e-mail statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Apparently, she got hit by a car on a Swiss highway because of a suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after the woman left on the highway under several vehicles during the early hours of Thursday, which apparently was suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 street near the Morges'ta Vádi canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "imaginative deed" and stood in the dark down the road where she was hit by several vehicles, said the Vadi police.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with multiple vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several operators involved in the event have already been interviewed, but not all have yet been identified, told the police who appealed to them and all those who witnessed the incident to report.
Crime investigation has begun, which is a logical step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genevelle.
"But you can see if any of the involved drivers are charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's going to be resolved by the prosecutor," said Hofstetter.
The two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held liable.
In either case, where there was a person who walked on a dark highway, it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police were released from prosecutions regarding the non-violence of the death penalty after he was caught and killed by a man lying near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, told the court.
The court noted that the police who were responding to the emergency call were justifiably driving, and that the man was in the way of "a state of exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus once lived
According to NASA's new model of climate, Venus was likely to live once.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether there would be heat in Venus, to draw with surfaces and to fill carbon dioxide with air conditions at times could be groundlike conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’ slow speed of rotation explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it could still have been running slowly.
The model also looked at the formation of the early Venus surface.
The planet was likely to have smaller areas, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and to protect the rapid degradation of water.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30 per cent of the darker sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, slow circulation of Venus reveals its day’s sun for nearly two months at a time", the GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in the news release.
This heats up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that acts as a umbrella protecting the surface of a large amount of heat from the sun.
The result is that the average temperature of the climate is actually a few degrees cooler than the current Earth.
The model produced a story of Venus’ development that is similar to what planetary researchers had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be living sometimes, it was exposed to excessive heat and UV light over several billion years.
Its oceans disappeared, and its water vapours burned in the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, it was only left with its thick carbon dioxide-killing greenhouse effect Venus, which we now know.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Liters publication.
Patrick Roy quit the Avalanchen coach's nest
On Thursday Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of Colorado Avalanchen Coach and Vice President of hockey affairs, which is to blame for the lack of influence on the team's decision-making process.
The Vice President/Chairman of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will begin searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Vice-President of the Colorado Avalanchen hockey affairs and head coach with zeal, passion and determination," said Roy, 50 years old.
During the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the opinion of the Vice-President and Vice-President on hockey issues must be fully aligned with the organisation’s view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was appointed the winner of the Jack Adams Award award to the best coach of the league in the first Avalanche season of 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and to the middle division victory, but Minnesota took down Colorado's playoffs in the first round, and the team hasn't been on in the last two years.
Avalanchen games during the period 2015-16 ended in 39 victory, 39 defeats and 4 games, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the wild card slot of the Western conference.
Hall of Fame selected goalie Roy won four Stanley Cupia - two both in Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue their negotiations and postpone the strike
The North Sea oil workers' struggle for wages is postponed when all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Laws against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been randomly organized by Royal Dutch Shell, led by the North Sea drilling trucks.
The joint opinion on "Wood Group and Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the process for the resolution of the current dispute".
Over the next few weeks, we will be holding several meetings throughout the day from early next week, so that we can take up a fresh survey stock.
According to trade unions, their recent action to combat work, said to be the first for more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut the fees for North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s premium reduction follows a 10 % reduction in the number of contractors in its countries for 2014.
The company said that further cuts would allow the company to cope with the fall in its mobile space market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from their wage lists and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company will reduce its operations as a result of its giant fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the decision of the UK to leave the European Union in June.
Mr Dave Anderson, from Scotland, met allies earlier this week in order to discuss one-generation of the largest North Sea labour disputes.
He said that the North Sea is essential for the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just for few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $14.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the star range of Plejajas
The most recent task of the Kepler Avastroscope has helped astronomers collect the most complete list of star speeds of the Plejaja series.
New information helps astronomers to understand why stars of the planet spin at variable speeds, and how orbits are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that, by comparing our results with the rest of the stars, we will now learn more about the relationship between mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, researcher of Caltech's Infrared Procession and Analysis of the Pasadena Centre in the press release.
The star range of the Plejads is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're rolling at their peak now.
At its peak speed, these growing stars are feeding large amounts of stars from the stars.
When these winds pass through the stars' magnetic fields, they brake the stars.
When the stars get older, the speed of its rotation is slowing down.
Kepler will measure the speed of rotation for each occasion by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star shots, such as sunlight.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars are running slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with larger ones making devils slower than smaller ones.
"In the Ballet" of the posters, we see that the slow spinners are usually more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since Plejadi's star range is so close, it is ideal for a cosmic laboratory to assess the star's properties by spinning speeds.
"The star range of the stars provides an anchor for the theoretical models of turning stars, which include both the mouths, the younger and the older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and, so to speak, hang their dance shoes on their nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejajad's speeds in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
