Camille Auer wanted to fix his sex, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now he's doing art on the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body".
There are dozens of patient reports from the roof of the Project Room Gallery in the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a multi-annual story about how third-party people have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
He's decided who he is.
"I wanted to tell you my personal history of treatment so the violence of the process is visible", says Auer.
With the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a period of years of study, including meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will start with the consignment for the diagnosis of "sex-identification" that will be conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Before this, he had used the oestrogen he ordered online and was, in any case, very long in his own repair process.
He felt like a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process so that the sex could also be repaired legally.
The Translaki, i.e. the law establishing the gender of the transsek gender (563/2002), obliges transsexual people to coercive sterilisation in order to achieve the right sex, for example, in the population register centre and the passport.
At present, every gender correction is required for psychiatric diagnosis and proof of infertility.
A person has the right to decide on his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
There has been talk about reforming the Translain in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations to the law and there is a preliminary ruling before the European Court of Justice which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right of self-determination.
The previous government in Finland prepared a change in the law under the leadership of the Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There were elections and the Finns of the Foundation rose to the government.
Now that we're back in law change, we're stuck.
It is a matter of domestic policy disputes which are not even related to this law.
"The hugdust does not want to raise it on the table because there are differences within the government about the law being amended" says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland.
The first part of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of packs of Auer’s medicines and instructions for use.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the trans-psychologist of Tampere University Hospital from Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on this basis that should be defined for the treatment of Auer's justice and the provision of assistance.
The sense of reality being studied appears to be exposed to destabilisation.
The understanding of yourself being studied shows itself in a cross-border way, and the unstable features associated with personality are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," says Auer.
There was even greater shock when Auer was not given gender correction treatment.
According to the care personnel, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
Then, on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television on the waiting table of transpol.
Later on, that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflexed his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any man identified as a woman at birth can increase his breast, but it needs a diagnosis to remove the breasts," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you experience anything but the gender of your birth.
Unfortunately, the experience of Auer is not the only one of its kind.
The gender correction process is more severe for many spiritual reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its passage meets dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and justify their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many persons applying for the process have underlying mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible attempts at bullying.
Based on these considerations, the treating staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Auer says, "Auer, preventing care and assistance can eat a person in a worse situation than it was before the process began".
Auer’s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life and it is something that people generally find difficult to melt".
The depression has been treated with medications, and when Auer started to use hormones, it became easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and in teenage age.
Why the wide jaw did not seem suitable for its own body and why breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people close to him who see him.
Being seen is a basic necessity.
"There is so much to reason with your father by talking, by dressing, by sounding, and by moving," she says.
Today, Auer experiences his coming, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, close random comments may have hurt a lot.
It's the most painful thing when someone close to me is having a bad relationship with you.
"He should know who I am, and they know who I am, but he won't or will be able to inside it," he continues.
But not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body resistance, where body or parts of it may cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long process of research, there can be no formal confirmation of its own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-defence in relation to the legal sex.
A full-age applicant makes a written application for a new identity, saying that he is experiencing second sex.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identification number.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland, and Auer's exhibition is also attached to this requirement.
It has not been an artist's therapeutic experience, but an exhibition is a political and artistic work collection.
I want to believe that art is still of importance and that it can bring about political change, at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

Civil law organization gave a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, which carries out African-American civil rights, has issued a travel warning for Missouri, which is the cause of the discriminatory practices of the state and the racist attacks that have taken place there.
"The travel information provided by the NAACTP for Missouri comes into force on 28.8.2017 and calls for African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and extreme caution when travelling to the state, which has recently experienced a number of questionable racial events", reports the Organization.
The law that recently entered into force in Missour makes it more difficult to export cases of discrimination, and in addition, the implementation of state law is disproportionate to minorities, which, according to the NAACT, led to the provision of travel warnings.
People's rights are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of skin color and treated or killed", said the president of the NAACTP Missouri, Rod Chapel, on Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of one of the cases in a very short time."
The travel information for Missouri is the first warning from the organisation regarding the United States.
The organization mentioned as examples the racist comments submitted against African-American students at the University of Missour and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri's police arrested him, even though he was not accused of a crime.
The report also referred to the report of the Minister of Justice of Missour that the police would stop the black driver by 75% more likely than white.
"The purpose of the travel information is to urge people to be careful and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missour", Chapel says.
"Man must prepare, for example, by making money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015 hundreds of hate crimes were recorded, i.e. the sixteen most in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for companies to apply for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, which was guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after their adoption by immigration laws which force the police to arrest people for immigration violations.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other states, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for an explanation of the supplementary pension of the CEO
Mika Lintila (cent.) has asked Finnair for an explanation of the additional pension fee received by the managing director of the airline Pekka Vuramo, Yle.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the state's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Vuram was raised this week when Helsinki’s Words announced the remuneration development of listed companies’ managers.
In February, the Finnish Photographer News News of Vuramo’s supplementary pension.
Finnair said he would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has determined that additional pensions are not used for reward.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the principle of ownership for the last year.
The packages just got a little hard on the phone.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
The US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Hamburg at the G20 meeting in Hamburg seemed to be a wonderful opportunity for each other.
Since then, there has been a considerable chill.
New economic sanctions adopted by the Congress of the United States last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were subject to a narrow response in Russia.
The most shocking response has so far been heard by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which the sanctions Act signed by Trump means "full-scale trade war".
Even if Russian reactions were to be offset only by political rhetoric and over-reductions, the pressure between the United States and Russia is the reality after the short period following the choice of Trump.
In the United States, it was not easy to go through the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
However, the Congress accepted the law as a considerable consensus, but it was said that the adoption of the law was much more difficult for the President.
The Trump criticisms, therefore, of the law it has signed as a "markable deficiency".
President Trump's fist must have been the reason for Russia in particular, even though the adoption of a law restricting his own power must have been reluctant.
As well known, an investigation is being conducted in the United States on the possible interference between Russia and the presidential elections as well as the Trump campaign on Russia's connections.
The pressure between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short season.
Once the staff of the White House have changed rapidly and have discovered a variety of scandalous translations, it is increasingly evident that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the President.
Such a situation is certainly not desirable.
If Russia's relationship is bitter in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tensioning security situation in the Union's core region is strengthening relations in the Baltic Sea.
The EU has clearly held the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united at least on the main side of its Russian policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a country such as Finland, much for a trading Member State, economic sanctions have been a real deal.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
The EU has been feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the effects can be felt in Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennpower nuclear solution.
acidity in Europe has caused the exclusion of sanctions, for example, from the US economy of essential liquid natural gas.
Trade sanctions are a means of world policy to show vices.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and specific.
Otherwise, it is easy for them to do more harm than to benefit.
Is there nothing more holy?
Trump's White House now has a pillar of freedom
The absence of a statue is a sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, fell into the statue of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologicals of the Trump administration, knew well what was being done in a very good debate with Jim Acosta on CNN channel.
Miller didn't really judge the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have taken upon the huge flock of cruise organisers and illustrious characters from the statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the meaning of the statue, and in particular the addition of Emma Lazarus’s poem — 17 years after the statue was completed in 1903.
Miller set Acosta: "I don't want to go into history now, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of freedom for the entire world.
The poem was later added, and it's not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller wasn't wrong in himself, but it's not just history, as he said.
The essential words are Lazarus's touching words, the only quality in which the state calls not only immigrants but also "the poorest": "Your tired, your por, / Your huddled masses yearning to break free, / The worlded refuse of your teaming store."
The poem is now more timely than ever.
Miller didn't practice literature criticism, and he made it clear that "the poorest" are not welcome to Trump's United States.
The issue of the importance of the 'freedom' is part of the wider political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’s friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue’s feet, and they well knew that the act was a strong political one.
The purpose of Patsa was to express the links between the French and the American Republic with a classic symbol of freedom of woman's body.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but it has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name, a deported mother.
The connection of the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long been wanting to turn it back into original.
Rush Limbaugh – an instigator who can now be regarded as some sort of predictive sign of Trump – in 2010 claimed that the statue of freedom is not invited to anyone, but is an early pioneer of new conservatives, leading the United States to the darkness to cover the world: "Lady Liberty is coming forward.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The music doesn't show the way to the United States."
It's rare, though, that Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the statue of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck after a long and challenging journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for a better life.
His statue of freedom comforts by giving hope and welcome.
And Miller and Trump don't want that anyway.
Their calling does not show the way, but causes the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scottishs got into the British country team
Neil Black, head of the British Sports Association, says that 16 members of the national team participating in World Championships are a "markable confirmation".
A record of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Championships in London on Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland, "there is something special about this event", something that British sports must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to examine it for so long that we understand what the question is," Black says.
"I focused with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
On the other hand, the Scottish Federation believes that it is linked to the operation of the Union,
and the British Federation of Sports believes that it is behind their actions.
And the usual streetr thinks he's got something to do with it.
But it's something absolutely awesome, and it's what it's all about."
In London, many Scottish athletes competed for the medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competed with Sir Mo Farah in a five thousand-foot race. Eildh Doyle, in turn, was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was amazing," Black says.
"The athletes left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they would live and practice.
Eilith's words included genuine feeling and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is the silver medalist of the League of Nations championships in the 400-metre moustache, and these are his fifth World Championship.
The previous record was seven years 1983 and 2015.
The middle travel runner Laura Muir has been running five United Kingdom and two Europeans' record over the year.
He competes in London at 1 500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs in London 1 500 meters. Also, he is worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes winnings in the UK World Cups and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only score on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he's so proud of the fact that there are so many receipts, some of which are really competing with the finals and medals.
"In other words, it is a great honour to become a captain, but it is even more specific because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots who got into the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are part of the award as athletes who compete for prizes.
Captain?
I thought it went well.
I was focused on how lucky we were when we had a home race.
It is important to enjoy domestic support and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Obstruction of critics on Facebook: Do not submit to public office if you do not endure criticism
Our country's father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics at all times in his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
but he did not silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led dumb and quiet like a sheep slaughterer," Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association challenged Hogan's justice earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also marginal online.
"What difference does it make? It's just Facebook," a lot of comments.
But it matters.
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is the amazing Republican governor of the state ruled by the Democrats.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to the hot cat.
He's led the state firmly, and he's held close to the principles.
He has also been able to use Facebook as the main contact channel for his voters and there published a picture of the chamotherapy in his head.
It is therefore unnecessary and even dangerous to prevent users coming to the governor’s Facebook page. The Governor’s website is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax resources.
Hogan's informant Amelia Chase defended the governor's activities in his interview with Washington Post.
However, stamping commentators into trolls, smugglers or haters is too easy.
Washington Post interviewed the users of Hogan's Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They reported that their comments were respectful, kind, and proper.
The pastor quoted in his comment the Bible; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
Professor Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland Bowie was not hostile but raised the question of hate crimes.
"I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a position on hate crime and other recent news", he wrote in Washington Post's comments.
"And I cannot accept the fact that when more people comment on the same thing, they are considered to be an organised group in any way and that they are ignored as a major group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called comments "a central attack".
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by preventing a critic or removing critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical editorials, or arrested and silenced protestors.
But it's actually the same thing, and now it's only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official holder to blame for chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump's blocking Twitter users have sued him.
This was the first important decision taken last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandrian judge James C. Cacheris, the government of the district of Loudoun violated the first addition of the U.S. Constitution in preventing the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Federation visited a discussion with the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, on Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, low-cost mail payments had a similar effect as they now had on the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers mutilated Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in newspapers where they called for Washington's decisions.
There are petitions to the President's office which criticised Jay's agreement, namely the agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom on cooperation, trade and shipping, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the basic stones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
It's a good idea to stop the bird's summer food right now.
The samples have come from about ten places, and also from two, three.
Most of them have become from South and Varsinais Finland, but then individual from Haapaved and Seinäjoki, special investigator Marja Ismursu from Evira.
The green nests have died in the desert called trichomonosis.
It is caused by the scientific name of Trichomonas gallinae being the original animal.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, and especially into a wedding.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also found in nest birds.
In 2009, it was a good idea.
Then trichomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland’s green nesting stock, after which the stocks of the species have been on their way to recovery.
The sick green nests have now been, but not yet in the big scale, says Juha Honkala, the museum master of the University of Helsinki's Natural Science Center (Loomus).
It is feared that the previous epidemic of the green nests will come back again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the bird's summer meals immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field performance at the Renaisnce Club
The former European first player, Ronan Rafferty, hopes he will benefit from the home field for the next three days when the Renaisnce Club in East Lothian organises the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year, Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament in the neighbourhood of Archerfield Links before the last round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has preferred a new place and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I've been following the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it's gonna get to its full glory," says Rafferty.
"The players can see the field at their best, it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
The tournament is a great demonstration for this field."
The English Eales defends the championship for the first time, even though the 32-year-old career has won both the European tour and the European challenging tour.
"This seems like a very special opportunity," says a player in Southport.
"I couldn't stand up for my extramadura Open victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we'll always remember."
Gary Orr is going back to work on his own soil, and he went on tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"To play home is always more meaningful than usual" says Orr in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
"I'm happy with my mirror so far."
The triangle will be able to follow the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament is attended by six seats: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if there is only a driver in the car, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All the proceeds will be donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Association.
Any internal air problems of the campar were investigated in the silt
At the high level, no internal air problems have been found in the chamber building of the Prikat communication company of Pori, which was reported on Thursday.
We'll continue our internal air research.
The studies began when a man who interrupted his service for health reasons believed that his health had fallen due to the bad indoor air of the camp.
According to Colonel Mika Holmman, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other gearmen.
It turns out that it was an individual matter, and there have been no health problems for those who served in that unit.
Each report is being taken seriously and we wanted to look into it in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, says Holma.
The Prikat's release states that because of July's arrival, it must have moved the goods to the barracks and therefore dust could have increased at the moment.
The air may have been intrusive because of this, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s gold country
Bardina Degei doesn't use her cooking plant to lighten up.
He only rarely uses the cattrap.
Degei lives in a wood building in Enarotal, the capital city of the Pania region, located in the Indonesian restless Papua province. When he manufactures dinner, he usually puts a batat – locally "no" – directly on fire.
After half an hour, the potatoes burned to the herbs will be thoroughly eaten with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Dege's home, he sits in a mutated underground, where he usually handles his day-to-day as well, like washing in a nearby swamp in the same water.
I'll have the clinic deliver a bucket in a catless room.
Degei is her youngest husband of four wives, and she has not been assigned to the fields to be treated.
It's common here.
Later work can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five tonight," Degei says.
This is a rare moment on the top of Papua in the Arctic, the former Dutch colony, which was attached to Indonesia in 1969. The accession was preceded by a controversial referendum, where the price of 1 026 was forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement against the Dutch authorities quickly turned its hatred to the Government of Jakarta, which holds the area under strict control and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The enaratalal is isolated and the skull begins on a flight of one and a half hour from the capital of the province from Jayapura to Nabire and continues on the stomach on a five-hour drive from the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In about 19,000 inhabitants there are wood houses surrounded by bamboo gardens, with a substantiation of rust dyed into bellows.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, the people of Papua Mee Pago worshiped the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have any clothes like this," Degei says. He means a colorful, hand-made rollhead, dark bite, and bright color for his sweater.
Before, we had only leaves as a cover of our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia; 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
Pania is about the size of New Jersey, with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about a hundred kilometers from Panama is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, located in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced 3,1 billion dollars of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion of wood reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the popes, for they mean the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military staff and local military units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004. Up to $150,000 was paid to individual officers.
The demands of the pope on greater self-defence threaten this source of income and are silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 clergymen and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission for Human Rights, mass killings in the higher tribes of Papua in the 1970s received proportions of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested over 3 900 people in peaceful demonstrations.
In a report by the British Archdiocese, We Will Lose Everything for 2016, reports of the brutalities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular ways – and unscrupulous attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"The calculation of the number of victims is difficult because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Ruuvia has been blackmailed when Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provins, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the Indonesian population is moving from the Jaava, Borneon, Sumatra and Sulawes to the region in hopes of better survival.
The Jaavaswarung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mix in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"Newers have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, from Pania, who moved to the capital of the province after the work.
"The local women lost their customers."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, Jokowi, from his favorite name, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua's injustice and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to the capital city of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts broke because we voted on Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You say.
In Pania, there was some kind of wave base only two months after the entry into force of the Jokowin October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the fire in Enarotal on 7.12.2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on the motorcycles.
The feared children told the soldiers that they should use driving lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, he returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses reports, drunk soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16 years old, Yulianus Yeimo, fell into coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Board near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand clergymen — young men and women and children — met on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting lines for the celebration, and they began to play the traditional Waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe, where we danced in the circle and imitated the bird song.
Some protestors began to stone the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere warmed up, soldiers in the internal radio system received an order: "If the troops do more than three times resistance, shoot them to death." The information is based on a formal document that the TIME magazine has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident director of Kego Koto area, knew the situation would fall out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told the TIME magazine, a bright-colored wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"A number of shots were fired in the VA. "
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shots.
"I came to him and made sure that it was indeed him", told Yohanes TIME as a tragedy. Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Pope's chief officer, Yotje Mende, told the editors that the police were just "promoting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Pupua police informant Pudjo Sulistio said in 2015.
"That's when it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The day following Jakarta's death, the information on the deaths was recorded.
Three weeks later, in Jayapura, Jokowi gave an emotional speech expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the violence of Papua.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that nothing will ever happen again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he will launch investigations of human rights violations outside the legal system.
But he started canceling his speech right away.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The main thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but there are certain processes in it," he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to begin an investigation at Papua.
"All will be settled in court," he told me.
The UN blames Wiranto for "criminal humanity". The crimes relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody declaration of independence in East Timor in 1999 to the TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania have a dark disbelief about the claims.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't moved in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I fear the army will arrest me, and I fear that I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panicns dare not discuss the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had assaulted him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are buried in their hands," he says.
The amps aren't over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Pania neighbourhood in Deiya.
One died and 17 injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which started when the manager refused to take a man who had lost his mind to the hospital, including children.
The man who needed medical care was 24 years old Ravinus Douw, who had been sent to the water while fishing in the nearby river, and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their views at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned cops who responded with warning shots.
According to the local authorities, however, the mobile police department of Indonesia opened fire toward the crowd when one of the villagers was killed.
"We're scared of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded when they were brought to care.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots to be fired by the police and the withdrawal of the mobile police unit from the area.
Panic has always been the problem of the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live on Papua's wheat fields in the middle of the highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the papal rights by accidental attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian military soldiers.
Part of OPM's leaders is Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arresting and arbitraryly imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "secure of national sovereignty".
Some of those arrested will never come back.
Among the Papuaans, Panama is known as "created, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
Only a small amount of rice is sold in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for local people,
Like a bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is women's work, and one woman can be responsible for four or five bat games.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten bats cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in local and migrant income have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at the airport of Nabir.
There are few jobs, and they tend to be more localised and more wealthy migrants.
Only a few popes have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own company competitively.
"The young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Panian tribal council.
Syrrical Papa will be little distracted in the world.
In addition, there are still strict restrictions on international news.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, even though they had been given a rare description permit.
According to Phelim Kinen, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, Jokowi has not kept its electoral promises; he has not increased transparency and has not contributed to development by removing restrictions on news.
"Indonesia's unrest from the easternest provinces of Papua and Western Papua are exposed to new risks: refusal of visa and access to the black list", Kine stated in his opinion.
The lack of freedom of action in the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressured by the neighboring neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the 'numbered and widespread crimes' in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These countries have traditionally supported Papua's liberation movement.
In Jakarta, editor of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir challenged the allegations and told journalists that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights violations".
The locals want foreign governments to be absent.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands led by Mr Kees Van Bar visited Jayapur on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, reports the anonymous source of the meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections in 2019, but the clergy say that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in the shooting of Pania," says Gobai, Chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowin to know about the situation of the panicns: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in lack and poverty, virtually without health care and education opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panics, like the other clergymen, hold their votes in favour of Jokow, which must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and fear, the families of the victims of Pania's shooting once more pointed out a symbolism: they buried one of the victims in the opposite land of the police station and the military headquarters.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks about the cancellation of Robert Helenius' replay: "Even your fans don't want to see it"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora of boxers were due to be held in Hartwallarena on 27 May.
However, the fight was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent IFL TV interview, Chisora makes a reason to flirt with the shoulders of Helenius.
My fight in Finland was a floppy, but it wasn't my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him move because he sucks, Chisora bored.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point sentence.
The ticket sale of the latest match went quiet, and Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom that the match had been moved to autumn.
There's nothing new about the fight.
But it's not too bad for Chisora to cancel.
In fact, the fight would probably have to be withdrawn after Chisora got sick.
Thursday, three days before the time of the fight, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My brand was about to explode.
They said I had to be cut in the hospital, Chisora says.
British says he's in about 45 percent condition right now.
He's not interested in a renegotiation match with Helenius, he's focused on Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December.
He's the one who's had the power to repeat the count of the " Torch" in Dubai.
The flames occupied the world’s highest reading residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee from the 79 - foot - high building.
This was already another fire within two years of the building, whose name happens to be a Torch, ringing.
The building was empty, and no one knew that it was hurt, and there was no idea why the fire was right after the event.
"We were asleep and woke up with the fire alarm in voice and in the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor that took ten minutes," the resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, fire extinguishers were switched off at 4:00 a.m., and left the building cooled.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
Following the fire in 2015, the management of the Torch building carried out a study to find out that the plates used for the curtain and isolation of the most harmful public expenditure are affected.
In the UK, the police believe that London's Grenfell Tower insulation and curtainboards could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.
Riverous parking lot was stolen during the night
From the parking lot in Joensuu, a mop was stolen between 21.00 p.m. and 5 p.m. midweek.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäe Road 2.
Mopo was obviously Sky Team Monky.
It's red in colour and it's 27-REV.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.
Police are asking for observations on the mop or its trap by e-mail This email address is protected from spambots.

Modified 3.8.2017 at 12.40: The police informed me that the mop was found.
In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take prohibited items on board, exposes survey
A survey conducted by air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had exported prohibited items knowingly or unknownly to aircraft passing through the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least 6% of passengers had strange or other steel-operated items that they did not know were banned.
Less than one percent told me that they had only subsequently known that they had failed to carry weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to threaten the rules.
The TSA's rules for consciously violated passengers were 19.7 per cent of members of the Y-skupolve and less than 15 per cent were part of the X-suppression.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and liquids to the plane.
More than three per cent of men admitted that they had exported steel - equipped objects to the plane knowingly. In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had exported prohibited drugs to the aircraft knowingly.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally passed a security check and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that most passengers are also most likely to pass the smuggling goods through the security check – knowingly or not.
But as the company that has done the survey says, the TSA’s instructions are very complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what fluids to take into the plane and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA's people who have been captured are liquids.
For some time there was also a feeling that books should not be taken into the plane.
We're allowed to take fluids to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Head of the US Environment Agency, passed his decision to delay decisions taken during the Obama season to reduce emissions
The day after the appeal of 15 states to Scott Pruitt, director of the US Environment Agency, Scott Pruitt, cancelled his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the smoke-free decisions taken during the Obama regime.
According to the rapporteur, the change shows that the Agency, which has led him, takes better account of the needs of decision-makers responsible for the environment in the states.
Pruitt did not mention the action which had been brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
States should begin to comply with the 2015 ground ozone standard as from 1.10.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would transfer the implementation of the decisions by one year, so that his agency would have more time to examine the plan, as the Agency "don't want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was a public prosecutor in Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him Director of the EPA, known as the contrary to stricter environmental rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions taken by the chemical industry and the industries using fossil fuels.
The sudden change of mind in the middle of the week is the latest setback to the Pruitt's plan to mitigate the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted a decision to exceed its mandate in the attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration decision on oil and gas companies, obliging companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In its opinion of Wednesday night, Pruitt claimed that its full version of the ozone rules was simply confirmed by EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In previous administrations, EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge the court in which the timetables were reached", Pruitt said.
"We do not believe in regulation through trial and take time seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its powers to us."
The EPA opinion, however, concluded that Pruitt could continue to use "a delay in the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" in order to ensure that the provisions "justifiable and based on best available information".
The Republicans in Congress drive a wider change in ozone regulations.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The general prosecutor of the state of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who has been sued by the EPA this week, said that the group intends to continue to press on.
"The change of the EPA's mind as a result of our actions is a significant profit for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of the smoke spray in their communities", Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the complaint included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhodes Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
The ozone of the surface is produced when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil treatment plants and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This can cause severe breathing difficulties in sensitive groups of people, which is also partly due to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed the surprising change in Prue.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required for a guy like our breath to make sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We have to fight against Trump's regime, because its ideological aim is to act on the terms of the polluters and other interested groups."
The supercar manufacturer is becoming a street star, "it's like Ferrari style"
It will also contribute to hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be disclosed next year, when the Italian manufacturer of supercars presents his new five-year plan, Autobusiness News news.
All cases of Eastern Savopopopopox of the same virus type
THL is reported as the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo.
On Thursday, the Laboratory of Virology at the Health and Welfare Institute has ensured that the fifth flock of ashes from East Savo is the same as that of previous infections.
The THL has ensured that the presence of the ferret in the shores of a person confirmed on Friday 28 July is the same as that of the previous cases of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections in East Savo relate to the first influx found in June.
The news is good, because it means we haven't been able to reveal any other types of mumps virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may still occur between August and August, and that is why the epidemic is not over, says Mirkalene Erkkila, doctor responsible for basic health diseases in Soster.
There have been no new ash claims or suspicions of them since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to take care of the timing of their vaccination, Mrs Erkilä.
More information on: Three new ferrets were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Lands or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland is preparing to make a promising shield
Pontika's soup wasn't even considered for legalisation.
In the background of the argument that the process produces also alcohol in addition to methanol, which is toxic.
The preparation of the shield at home will be legal next year, but the legalisation of the point’s soup will not even be considered.
The shield is prepared by use, the point is again by distillation.
The background to the distillation regulation is that the process, along with the booze, produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate a point's soup for every man's rights, and the Government Adviser Ismo Tooninen commented on the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared a reform of the alcohol law, it was not considered to be legalised.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Congressman Outi Mäkelä.
He is in the negotiating force of the parliamentary groups of the Government Party, who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
In the future, you will not even be able to apply for a point at home.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
The introduction of alcoholic beverages is a simple rule for home production: alcohol can be prepared by use at home.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally do the screaming at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes requirements for taste and flavourings and allows the manufacture of the shield, Mäkelä will specify.
The preparation must still be prepared in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings produced in connection with their use are clearly detectable in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be made for themselves as much as you want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
You can't still put it on the market.
The action of the shield is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Importing believes.
A much larger change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 per cent of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will come to the Parliament as soon as the season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like Parliament's already taken a stand, Mäkelä's happy.
Oscar Pistorius was tortured by armed guards at the hospital
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast pain, was commended for heart attacks at the South African hospital.
The pistorius has already got out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is suffering from his prison sentence in Ateridgeville.
According to the British terrorist magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital by armed guards this morning.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison informant confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital to study.
The messenger of the Pistorius family told me that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned a six-time Paralympic gold medalist for six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literated phone conversations reveal Trump's pressured Mexico for the construction of a frontier wall
Literations of telephone discussions between the President of the United States Donald Trump and the heads of Mexico and Australia have flown to Washington Post.
On 27 January 2017, Trump called on the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to put an end to his public speech that he was not going to pay the proposed limit.
The President of the United States called Nieto for a public plot of the wall. "You can't say so to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the South border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a litterization on Trump's first call to Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on the way to Australia must be 'sufficient', 'bad' and 'faty'. According to Trump, the agreement negotiated during Obama would make him look like an idiot, because he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump stopped calling to find Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day".
Georgia's massacre: Activists re-painted racist lynx in the hope of justice
Ford Mercury’s car bypasses the population in Monroe’s small town of Georgia and moves towards the small Moore’s Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men are blocking the road before they get to the bridge.
The leader of a team, a middle-aged man dressed in a strip dress, takes a deep breath of his cigar and stretches through a windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n-u!" man's slumbering.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event is, fortunately, only a re-distribution, presented on 22 July 2017.
But the shocks are real when a hanging loop is inserted into the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to re-paint the events of 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan had two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – although murderers live among us and many people need to know who they are", says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in re-emergence arrangements.
"It's a shame in history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
To him, re-dispatch must be alarmed by the invitation to act, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty people to go to justice, and we want things to finally be concluded, and we want to recover from grief and make a settlement, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The medical examiner covers the body of the victim who died in the massacre in Georgia 27.7.1946.
According to the FBI reports received by NBC news, over 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of stealing.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives for lynching have been locally known: politics and sex.
In 1946 the Blackmen of the state of Georgia had the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, and the Supreme Court gave its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred at the time of the election, where a black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white owner in a fight with Barnett Hester, apparently related to Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
Brooks said the city was told that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to the FBI, the powerful white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid 25.7.1946 Malcom's 600 dollars guarantee against which he was released from prison.
On their way home with Malcom and Dorothy, their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their car before Moore's Ford bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and ordered the murders," reports the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. Officials were involved in murders and destroyed evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks is giving it more attention.
"It was a voteright murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has directed the re-emergence of the massacre in Georgia for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and imprisoned, and it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It's hard to watch, but it's even harder not to see what Greene thinks is supposed to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because we'd have to face our own dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s presentation exercises began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — about a dozen black people and twenty whites — gathered together to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh works as Greene's assistant director.
He has presented the local head of Ku Klux Klan in the re-energence for many years, but the role is always as difficult and reluctant.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is, however, important that this aspect of history is maintained so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their words.
The performance begins with a scene in which Malcom screams and works Hester, and he's upset that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
I said get off my land, n-u!
Rascona or Hester will respond.
Then we're going to take a shot.
And then everyone (almost all black actors) will be laughing at.
Greene laughs hard.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally get too strong?" he asks.
"Et", Greene's squeezing.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n-u at that time."
"So," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room has the power of a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but they want to respect the memory of the people who died.
The scene begins at the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are circling.
Nobody laughs.
The re-establishment will end quickly and violently.
The noise, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed for a black funeral stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks every other word.
A few ten meters away, twenty viewers wipe out sweats and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half white.
There's a couple in the group who's come to see the show from Ithaca in New York, but most of it's local.
They've been guided by Brooks' graves in Georgia's heavy moisture.
The murders have turned from the story to reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene calls the crowd to check the bodies.
Children are able to watch artificial blood and unmoved bodies and whisper to one another.
"They're not really dead," it's like a little boy's mute to remind himself of himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who were acting as markers took away their reference and wiped tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man presented by the local Director of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after a hard show.
"Don't worry," she's been on the show to comfort me.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors will meet for dinner together.
The white couple who arrived from the pool will be busy discussing the presentation with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinskin is hard to find words when he describes feelings raised by the presentation.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch terrible deeds that say and do people who look the same as you – precisely because they look the same as you," he says.
"I realized that the shocks would continue to happen," he added. "They're just called arrests."
Brooks, on the other side of the room, recalls the development of civil rights for audiences sitting on the same table.
He says he's already started the next year's presentation.
“A re-examinement is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it is also a teaching experience”, Brooks says.
"This message is that this can happen again if we do not take it into account.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
The grubbing up of plants in shops is a waste: This amount of "excessive parts" actually saves
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of the flower cup already in the store before weighing?
What about taking away the big hat from the pineapple? I mean, it weighs a lot?
The answers are a strong distribution of opinions: for one it is a sign of the extremeity of the doll, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and which, however, go into the trash at home.
I'm sure they'll identify it in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable department in the Ruoholahti K-Citymarket in Helsinki because many of the leaves in the flower balconies, for example, are torn off.
From the box, the magazines are being sold to bio-waste.
According to the news published by the Economic Poles, falling asleep on the vegetables court is admiring the merchants.
But how much money does it save to remove extra parts of vegetables before weighing?
How important is this really?
We women from the test, how the price changes when you take off the leaves or carry the leaves, from the pineapple, the latva artichokes, the delicious mushrooms, the parsacals and the flower scales.
Florist: EUR 2,10 per flower to pay was EUR 1,80 when all the leaves were peeled out.
Ananas: the price of the total pineapple cost to pay EUR 2,30 fell to EUR 1,95 when its position turned off.
Latva: EUR 2.60 per price was EUR 2.40 when the short position was cut off.
Sweet mushrooms: Two delicious mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, 60 cents came to the price.
Parsal: Medium size broccoli cost 1 euro and without stock 80 cents.
Final result: If leaves and stocks start to nod off, save a few tens of cents for one vegetables at best.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables decreased by up to 20%.
Thus, these purchases would have saved a total of EUR 1,20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the brassy star made a five-year deal with PSG
The Brazilian lawyer, Neymar, has entered into a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Formerly on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona on the league of Spain.
The amount of the transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in the history of football.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which paid 105 million euros last summer for French Paul Pogba.
Spain was too slow to move earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar's representatives.
According to the rules of the league, the purchaseer cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player himself has to buy his contract out, which happens by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who delivered the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines details
In addition, Barcelona reported that it provided information on the payment to Uefa of the European football union in order to enable it to determine the possible disciplinary measures that may arise from the case.
Among other things, Mr. Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish league, suspected that PSG would break the rules for Uefa's economic fair play with its money.
Uefa may be punished for the loss of over EUR 30 million over a period of three years.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically break its economic cycle.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the society's economy for many years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with significant sums, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned qatarian company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis pro, qatarilainen Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, we've got some severe burns from the lightning strike. The flash-off recorded in the security camera at the airport.
Austin Dunn was doing normal work measures for the plane at the Lounas-Florida International Airport with a couple of crews when suddenly from the rainy sky a lightning hit the plane.
The force of lightning threw the plane into the land near the wing.
Dun was rushed to the hospital.
He had a third degree of burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said he got an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if he's alive, says Austin's sister Autum.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
That's not how to wait.
It's traumatizing for everyone, says Autumn.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on-board at the time of the event and the transport business itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and restores business dividend by cutting
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to the pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already reduced 4 000 jobs in the context of the previous structural arrangements.
In May, Pearson announced that he would once again cut costs by £300 million as part of his third saving programme, with the aim of revitalizing the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearlson decided to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann, who announced that it would hold its current year's outlook, which increased by one per cent in the first half of the year and was GBP 2.05 billion.
An attack on the escort in Kabul: NATO's soldier died in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber hit a military escort in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul. According to the authorities, he was killed by a NATO soldier and several others were wounded.
According to NATO, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unsolicited local data, three civilians also died in an attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died of a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, a Thursday evening explosion occurred when the joint patrol of NATO and the Afghan army became the target of an attack on a "person with a self-made explosive device".
The opinion stated that everyone who was injured was stable and was treated at the American military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, at least 1.662 civilians were killed, of which 20 % were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed in a suicide attack in Kabul, which mainly lives in Shiiamuslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, in the centre of Kabul, more than 150 people were killed in a bombing that was the most devastating attack on the military group in the country after the United States-led troops hit the Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether to send more troops to the country to help local army and police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks last week in Kabul have also significantly undermined people's trust in government, their policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA will round its decisions on the postponement of the implementation of smoke-smokering provisions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, rounded its decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken during the Obama regime to reduce smoke-free emissions, the day after the 15 states had sued the Agency's law.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone definitions in 2015 late Wednesday, and according to the Agency, its commitment to cooperation with the states is indicative of its commitment.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said President Scott Pruitt in his opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to delay the implementation of ozone definitions by one year for October 2018. It was defined that the smoke level is measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollution should be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Agency sued 15 states primarily controlled by the Democrats, including District of Columbia, which, according to them, were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought ways of mitigating the environmental regulations at Barack Obama's time, and Trump believes that the measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The measures taken by Trump have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of increasing emissions.
According to the EPA website, ozone-containing air breathing “may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person belonging to the Isis leadership had also sent Sydney the building parts of the bomb.
Suspects say that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell you more about why the company got interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-colored gas-dissolved device and to take the device to a public location, for example, in a public transport vehicle.
Deputy Secretary Michael Phelan of the Federal Republic of Australia says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
Nesten CEO: Recycling fuels were well managed
The oil farmer's profit before taxes decreased, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievose, the company did a good job in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products went up to the record level and the development of the operating profit of Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating gains improved the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievos, the operating profit of renewable products was maintained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to concentrate on our customers and our growth projects, and we will have the strategic investments that we have announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in the communication.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko will discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting match for the near future of a series of less than 66,7 kilograms, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN Sports Channel offices in Los Angeles until WBC’s undefeated light show champion Mikey Garcia walked along the hall to say hello to Lomachenko, WBO’s master of the upper feathers.
On Saturday, Garcia won the showtime with the unanimous decision of the last four world-class world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five on a list of different weight-class boxers.
Garcia took her right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on seven Saturdays.
When the twins gave photos to the photographers, the Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect".
"I'm an ex-smoker of feathers," Garcia reminded me.
"I'm next to the series [63,5 kilos] for the Broneria, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small size 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to the light show.
He has to climb into a light series [61,2 kilos]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans wish for.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Nurkling needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether the match should be organised by the payment channel. It is part of his strategy for the Lomachenko to debyt the spring series later this year and next summer will be against Garcia (37-0, 30 pts). Garcia would also be interested to meet the winner of the game between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will be taking part in the light series Forum on 23 September.
"The match could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that she was ready to take the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else will get the same attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said she appreciates Lomachenko as a "unbelief bet" and that she might go to the Saturday game.
Lomachenko interrupted the ringing of Garcia's mountain and said that this three-grade champion from the Riverside looked like, "I'm sorry, Mike... but you needed that knock."
Garcia said that she was focused on showing the force of impact and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was about to take place more and more.
"This is the match we're waiting for.
No other match will raise as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was waiting to fight the best. "Mkey's a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average wage 5 300 euros, training what happens - investment advice situation has been "vill and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Last Helsingin Sanomat reported about Ritavi, 68, to which the banker's investment advisor talked about the full pub when selling investment products.
The rules on the sale of investment advisors and various investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
They are based on the new Financial Market Directive, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and workers selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
No skills requirements are defined in the law.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service perform its own APV1 or APV2 research.
The financial sector has accredited the organisation of qualifications for APV investment studies Oy, which includes both financial supervision (Fiva) and experts from universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits and their exams are created by Aalto EE, which provides business management development services at Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
Its website states that in general both exams are "very broad in terms of requirements".
The educational material of the sciences includes 10-15 books as well as a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savokko, CEO of APV investment research, reports that the percentage of exams passed is roughly 70.
Most of the employees of the largest banks have performed either APV1 or APV2 studies, as their performance is mandatory according to their own rules.
Then there are smaller banking firms without mentioning the names of staff whose staff seems to have taken up the map of qualifications, says Savokko.
He says that these are banking lines called "moves."
According to Savikko, APV1 has completed between 13 000 and 14 000 persons since 2000 and approximately 3 000 APV2 qualifications for the most demanding investment advisors.
Some banking firms consider the completion of the degree to be an advantage.
Many other sectors have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Savokko says that the recommendations of the Financial sector require APV qualifications to be carried out, because that is when knowledge about the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors make on average several thousands of euros of commissions, including nature benefits and income commissions, per month.
The average monthly regular working hours are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, there are over €5 900 per month employed and women earn more than €4 500, respectively.
On average, the highest tens of earners earn about €8 100.
Tens of most men who earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of women who earn more than EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
There has been confidence in self-regulation at the level of employees and at the level of the task so far.
According to Fivan, the examination it carried out received individual cases where the investor’s professional qualifications and qualifications were insufficient on the basis of the advice.
Investment products can also be sold in principle, even if their skills and qualifications are at a smart level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free in principle.
Many other sectors have significantly stricter skills requirements, says Savokko.
It is estimated that from the beginning of next year this will be achieved with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are adequately qualified.
Financial supervision, in turn, may be the authority to determine what to be able to do.
Marko Hovi, market supervisor, explains that one of the current clear changes is the legislation on the knowledge and experience of investment advisors and investors of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply to both the staff of investment firms and the related agents who sell the products on behalf of a company.
The court tells us that according to the Government's presentation by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may be empowered to determine knowledge and experience.
From what they are exactly, these will be decided during the coming autumn.
The company shall also continue to ensure the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty of proof that this has also been done.
The court shall specify that, in practice, the company must, for example, identify the personnel’s activities at individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different requirements depending on whether it is about investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, it is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced when knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
So if the company employs a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who fulfils certain time criteria.
According to the court, the change makes the rules more tight and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

The flight route was drawn above the U.S. Flightradar24 service.
The flight was completed on Thursday on 787 Dreamliner which tested Boeing aircraft Rolls Royce engines on long flight.
During 18 hours and 1 minutes, a plane departing from Seattle flew 15 700 kilometers, which is longer than any regular commercial flight in the world.
The flight remained within the U.S. borders all the time.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra's blue beach swimming schoolmen don't take a rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen sneeze with the help of the swimming pool
Iines Kaikonen made good progress, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra's beach swimming schools run in Liette and Lempuka for this and next week.
Although sometimes rains and then shines again, young swimmers are not moxis, praises the swimmer Taina Itkonen.
In swimming schools this week, 13 children are mapped out, a dozen next week.
The next week’s number of children affected the fact that the school and the escrow started, estimated Itkonen.
The Imatra Coastauma School organises a joint movement project and a city of Imatra.
Thursday, Liette's beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers trained to stay on the surface with swimmers, someone without them.
The water also enjoyed smaller sisters.
Iines Kakko, five thought it was time for deeper water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to smoke towards the beach.
It's going great!
Iines Kaikonen told me that he had been swimming a lot this summer.
He's a good swimmer.
Like Kaikonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, the swimsuit congratulated.
Jami Kallio, four again, wanted water wars.
Anna Villberg, her daughter, Ilona Villberg, followed by six swimming on the beach, considers the beach swimming school to be a good start for learning how to swim.
Even though the weather has been what happens, every day Anna has liked to go here.
I had to warm up sometime.
The swim schoolmen packed themselves in the docks.
The boys had enough of a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels to the docks, daydreamed fruit and baked the day.
The teaching continued in the water, but the dock was not kept busy.
It's the kind of thing that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unidentified soldier sells toiletharves, "This is a story that connects with them."
It's all sorts of things you can see.
The blue product that makes cleaning products launched a series of unidentified military products a few days ago.
I mean, the dishes and the laundry, and the toilet brush with the edge brush.
An unknown soldier refers to a film and film marketing coming from the first night in this fall.
However, there is something special in the combination, and products have been removed from the social media: When will unknown health links come?
I need to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Vice President Aino Määtta say?
We're partners in the film.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted support for domestic production and cult film, Määtä says.
According to him, products will be put on a special promotion, and the film will thus be visible.
Isn't this a little funny - often when you think that there's something in common with the products and the stories attached to them?
Yes, here's the story that we are a Finnish operator, and these are Finnish products, Määtä says.
According to him, the company supports his Finnish basic values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning isn't a guest for a military culture, Mää is a point.
Other partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall vichyt has been placed on the market, called Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unidentified products have already been perata from Finnish Photography blog Kalle Kinnunen
There are already coffee and watches available.
Kinnunen points out that there's still time for the film to go on first night, so there's still another chance.
Not known partners have yet revealed their war products, for example, Valio, the Processor, Neste, and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers’ age tests were published
The latest results of Swedish asylum seekers' medical age tests have been published; however, the results of the new assessment method reveal that more than 80 % were determined to be more than 18 years old, but not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Judicial Office started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be assessed more closely with regard to the age of the asylum seeker, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failure to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be underage.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far carried out 6 880 tests, and the Agency has now published 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and late July 2017.
The 80 % test, i.e. 2002, was determined to be over 18 years of age and, in the case of 25 cases, the Agency determined that the test was "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, the outcome was that the asylum seeker was "possibly under 18".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there were grounds for suspecting the age of the applicant.
According to Johan Göransson's Law Office, the results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
"The figures are pretty consistent. Big differences in the statistics for the previous months are not detectable", he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18 years old, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, there were "references to 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it appeared that in 243 cases, the applicant had openly indicated that he had completed this year for 18 years.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee veins. Then dentists and radiologs analyse the images.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karoliinen Institute, whose work is to evaluate human biological maturity.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not correct.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine our age, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Legal Medicine Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is in a situation in which the test should be carried out soon for 18 years and then the risk is about 10 per cent."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five more than a par – result in the third round was spent on Mikko Ilosen 30 pips on the paylines down to golf in the European tour in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday at 11th place, but at the end of the round we found a place to split up 41.
Ilose was gathered in a difficult kennel with three bongs of a double bog.
The rest of us had a hard time.
An Englishman, Ian Poulter, rose to share the top of the line in one less than a couple of tours, even though he told me that there was enough work for the umbrella.
Keli was raw, but I was hanging with him, and finally the day was good, Poulter sense.
He's going to share his leading man with Callum Shinkwin and the Australian Andrew Dodt.
The governor of West Virginia is changing the party
On Thursday night at Trump's campaign event, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia announced that he would change the party.
"Democracy simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflections... today I will tell the West Virginias that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke out in the applause of the strips.
"To be a member of a registered Republican Party tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say to you, it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign event.
Trump won the West Virginia 42 points because Justice did not support the candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes said he was the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owned coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the Republican National Committee (CNC) issued a statement saying that "the exchange of the party of Governor Justice is again a new attack on a democratic party that is more likely to build obstacles than the better America."
"Democracy has only 15 governors and less states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback to a party that has no leadership, and which cannot find a positive, human-connecting message," said Ronna McDaniel, in his opinion on CBS news.
The lightnings sown for damage - Thursday will even come summer’s very busy day
In the end of the week, there will be more thunders in southern Finland.
Over the past week, particularly in the Middle and Northern parts of the country, and in the region of Varsinais-Suome.
On the night between the middle week and Thursday, the lightning attacks set fires on a number of fires.
According to the Meteorologist, Thursday may come a very busy summer.
The Ukkoskuros have finally found Finland.
Over the past week, it has been smuggled, especially in the middle and north parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suome.
On the table, the lightning hit the electrical center of the row house, causing a small fire.
The rescue facility received a report of fire about 15 a.m. on Wednesday midnight.
The electricity center was located in the sauna space at the end of the row house.
The rescue facility burst into the roof and wall to find firecrackers and quickly shut down the fire.
A total of 11 apartments were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
The lightning on the lake once again lit the outdoor building into the fires on Harjulant before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue facility was nothing but an obstacle to the spread of the fire.
A building of some 50 square feet [50 m] burned to the ground.
On the way to Kuopio, another lightning hit the home house.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a brand-new lightning strike.
There was a rescue facility to check out the case, but this time the lightning didn't get a fire from time to time. Only a few melts went off.
In traffic congestion caused problems on the train track between Wallau and Vasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the fault was received between 8 and 9 on Thursday morning, after which the trains between that time were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be corrected shortly before five afternoons.
At the same time, the train traffic has also been able to continue normally with a thunderstormed section of the train.
The lightnings have sown all over Finland.
However, there have been relatively few this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been completely dead! reviews Air Science Institute’s sundry meteorologist Jari Tuivinen.
The thunderstorms of the midweek and Thursday have been mostly moderate, but thanks to the low lightning level in the summer, it seems even powerful to many.
This might seem like a really tough thunder, but that's what Tuivinen says, compared to the thunder of this summer.
On Wednesday, the earthquakes broke 1,700 times, and Thursdays have had potential even the toughest day of summer: by about 16 a.m., there were 1,790 landscapes in the poster.
If we continue to the beginning of the evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, the Tuivinen predicts.
The previous record deficit was recorded in 2015, when the amount of lightning in the year was around 30,000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning volume had risen to 18 386 lightning.
So it is still interesting that this year should not break a record of two years ago.
However, the Ukkoskirin can be expected to continue.
According to the fire, Finland will also remain warm and wet during the final week, which is an environment acceptable to the thunderous.
On Saturday, the main focus of the elves is moving south from the northern parts of the country, where about 2,000 lightning days can be taken both on Saturday and Sunday.
The central part of the country is more united in the saderinda.
According to Tuvis, there is only a small amount of thunder.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for doping-scandal
However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Dmitri Shljaht, Russian Head of Sports Dmitri Shljaht, said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, that Russia's ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all those athletes who were taken to the competitions with gold or silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the public sport competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office WADA's report presented evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his reply today was very direct. It was a very open presentation", the president of the IAAF Coe told journalists.
"All the Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation admitted that the country had been through difficult times and announced that they would do their utmost to reorganise their activities."
Coe also said that he was "satisfied" to Russia's acceptance of the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress, but Congress supports the Group's recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize the situation in the coming months.
The basic principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes are competing with neutral athlete status in the World Championships of general sports in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
On Monday, Rune Andersen, Director of the IAEA Working Group, said that Russia still needs to meet many demands before its position can be restored.
"The test remains inadequate, and the trainingees who received the ban continue to be free," he told the journalists on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company disappointed the weak success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland did not succeed as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If you're honest with me, I'm disappointed, admits that the film produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff Ylen in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had achieved a fair 100 000 viewers, which is the film's budget, about EUR 5 million, compared to a small one.
There was no credit gain, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful in the country, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for little bites of foreign distributions, says Sucksdorfff.
Tom of Finland is a film led by Dome Karukoske.
How football's financial rules affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football euro will not prevent Neymar from transferring from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in Spain.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the UEFA, which will regulate European football, which can prevent the team from participating in the respected Masters league.
UEFA introduced the financial rules for fair play in 2011, and according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and the annual salary of Neymar in the new company moves to tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to his star map because it follows that Qaar's oil is financed by a enriched sovereignty ring.
The clubs are allowed to use large sums for the purchase of players, but they must be balanced by real sources of income so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for the fair game were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platin, the French president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the indebtedness of success was a scam and led to serious problems if banks or owners supported it.
In 2011, the focus of the financial rules for fair play shifted from debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that for the first time in Chelsea, Roman Abramovich made significant difficulties in implementing the business model. Abramovitch bought a promising team, used huge sums of player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of the financial rules of the fair game lasts until 2018, with a maximum loss of EUR 30 million for the follow-up.
Although Platini had to leave the functions of the President of UEFA scandalously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, also wants to curb the reckless use of the clubs.
"The rules of the fair game are still in place, and we will apply them in the future", Andrea Traverso, responsible for the economic rules of the fair game in UEFA, told Associated Press News Office last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it may extend the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
The five-year agreement has been concluded by Neymar and the transfer amount can therefore be recorded in the annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the following five years.
On the basis of the financial rules of the fair game, the first penalties were issued in 2014. The highest sanctions were imposed on the Manchester City, which was financed by PSG and Abu Dhab.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the Society was ordered to limit its team of Masters to 21 players in 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to circumvent its economic rules by increasing their income through companies related to social owners.
For example, if the qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA will not calculate the aid as the actual revenue.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the aid granted to PSG by Qaar’s tourist authority was over-responsible.
It has also been shown that some of Neymar's profits in PSG could be financed by the fees available to the organiser of the 2022 football MM competitions.
However, the PSG and the Organisation Committee have denied that Neymar would be made of a ambassador to the MM competitions, which would be very easy for UEFA to disclose such a arrangement.
As a result of the earlier sanctions of PSG, UEFA is more likely to follow more closely the rules for companies.
On Thursday, the available sources reported that UEFA had not consulted with PSG about Neymar’s transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press News Office on condition that their identity was not disclosed, as they had no authority to discuss the situation in PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, PSG's turnover for the period 2015-2016 was EUR 542.4 million and operating profit exceeded EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the past period have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and to increase sales of social and gaming products.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% as a result of the Neymar agreement.
From the departure of the best players in the world, Spain too tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, claiming to violate the economic rules of a fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the company and the state," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish league, to the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the football club. Arsenal owns an American sports club.
"The kill is the result of the ownership that has changed the football environment in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"All is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be extremely difficult to comply with the economic rules of the fair game. There are so many kinds of interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now is a hurry: Finnish MM athlete in prison in Helsinki
Long-term jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three-star Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazarya are stuck in Helsinki, although she should train at the MM-games in general sports in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
The Pajulahti competes tomorrow at the length of the jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in the three-legged carnage.
However, the twin coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa in Great Britain.
Ghazzaryan has tried to deal with this at the British Embassy.
The coach has been called a documentary by the World Cup organisers, but he has also failed to obtain a visa.
Whether this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always dealt with visa issues successfully before, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It's not that big a deal.
As long as someone looks at the steps at the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach would be out of his way.
MM medal for FinlandLonto requires a miracle
The World Cup competitions start in London this Friday and lasts a fair week on Sunday 13 August.
Public sports, landscape skiing and hockey are the species to which Finnish bench athletes tend to take a passionate attitude from one year to another, whether successful or not.
The success of bench athletes in their hearts is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
A lower consideration is given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from value competitions to another, where the experience of gaining the skills of athletes to the level that the MM medal for adults is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in the Finland’s small MM team, and there are not even a few of them.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Happily, sport’s interest and surprise are those that even wonders can happen.
It pulls the bench athletes at the edge of the television screen and the glue to follow the races, even though London's medals are solved by the time difference only at midnight.
In the previous World Championships, 2015 Finland received one Pronssimital.
It was brought by the spear-thrower, Tero Pitkämäki.
Even now, even though the others tell the results of his and other executioners’ recent years, and the remaining of the Pit Hill will be cut off in the last summer’s prize competitions.
Whatever happened to these races, Pitkämägi will remain a great Finnish sports hero in history.
Access to the final competition for other Finnish athletes of the race or making a record of their own is good enough.
Hope and believe in the realistic medal hunt for the coming years of Finnish sports will provide good success in the international prize competitions of young people even this summer.
The processing of young people's talent and financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small set of representative athletes' elite.
The success will not come in a moment, but will require years of sweaty work for athletes and patience from both trained and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that London's races will remain in history as the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not, for example, because of the fear of terrorism or the attacks of the poor.
"But I'm really sorry."
The snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been located in the second big air race in the U.S. Colorado.
Copper Mountain's second cup is at Rukajärvi's best big garden world cup.
The women's race won the US Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump at the calballerie for the first time in the contests, and it was very close to success.
It feels good, and it's a good fit, but it's a shame that the last jump didn't go quite well.
I'm going to try it again in the races from now on.
In snowboarding big air, the competitor jumps from a hop made for the species.
Viking Line's new high-speed ship hit the port in Helsinki
Viking's new fast ship FSTR is very late for the schedule.
The ship was supposed to leave Helsinki at 18:00.
There were eight states on the ship running the loading.
The ship was already late for Helsinki.
At least for half an hour and a half, I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the autojourn is moving a little, at the Helsinki port, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is expecting access to the ship, told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought that the new ship had become a technical failure.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting for access to the ship in their cars.
Christa Grönlund, Communication Manager at Viking, tells IS that there was a technical failure.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The vessel leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's return trip for a few hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn at 20:15 in Helsinki.
42-metre special transport interferes with traffic in Kuutosti on Thursday night
42 meters long, special transport from Mucos to the port of Mustola during Thursday night.
The nine-way transport should be available by midnight.
Police are driving traffic on the Moonstost, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
Transport from the wetlands is moving along the road 13th to the Port of Mustola.
The Little District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, both the days of the 80s' spell and the 90s ’ group of characters (for which time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant series of state schemes for MTV) and their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars moved into bigger things.
As a cultural product, it is both a parode and a description of the continuous fairy tale we are stuck in during our Facebook season.
As a commercial product, it seems to be already alive.
The first day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not only because of the absurd humor (including the background story of H. Jon Benjamin’s green talk in voice).
The reason for this is that middle-aged actors act as eager to reach the past is a part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodys the 90s stalk film films, such as the horror film Hand that boils the swing.
At one point one of the characters digs out Apple Powerbook, inline roller skaters and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Charity Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still has not been over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one of the crazy runs has been involved in Ronald Reagan (as Michael Showalter) as his criminal partner George H. W. Bush (which plays properly Michael Ian Black).
As always in these series, the best is sidewalks.
In particular, it is fun to see the iconicist Paul Rudd, who has a beard under his lower ear, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" movie with Singles. Rudd's exhibition Andy, the camp gift, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may rise this series into flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Liter. In its last scene, the group of friends will go to Wet Hot American Summer on their first night.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series once again appeals to another kind of nostalgic: The Americans series, the spirit of cold war, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series, which meets the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a romantic police drama in the 1980s, where a Pakistani cop fights for truth, atheism and Marksism.
In their capitals, Gregorina and Iosefina are seen as Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their words are dubans in English Channing Tatum (the lead producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levet.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police spend time watching television chess in the same way the Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous sound performers, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. They're having a fun game about their bonging.
However, the Comrade Detective remains too attached to the tracking of the social drama – for example, a killer hidden behind the Reagan mask, which is why the series is often beginning to really feel like a embroiled propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the sense of humor is not fast enough and not rich enough.
As an enhanced series, it might be better to act as agitprop-satiir, even though Gregor and Iosef regularly attend the US Embassy and the lobby with two fat men, who are always in an atmosphere of burgers.
The message to the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary creators of the series were not wrong: we were perplexing our own recent history and their history as well.
Kouvolian Toni Tauru rises on Saturday to the ring in Macao - a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game together.
Toni Tauru will receive a hard bone in Macao, as Brazilian Leandro Issa took a stand last year at the UFC organization.
The Brazilian also has a black belt and a world title of the species.
For once, I take myself against my parents.
It's a funny story. A 32-year-old Tauru will tell you.
The Kouvolaan had to get in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was canceled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were brought on a quick schedule for China's self-government region in Macao.
Tauru's never seen anything like it before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It made me nervous, because preparing and training took a lot of time.
The candidate, however, is pleased that there was a new time for the struggle.
Waiting for a week doesn't seem very much like preparing.
The transfer doesn't seem right, because it won't be right in a week.
The condition can get even worse if you're practicing too much now.
In his previous struggle, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in vertical position.
This time it's different.
Issaa Kouvolan describes her as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I'll bet he's gonna come on hard in the first round and try to take him to the mat.
He's won the juju World Cup, so he knows how to wrestle.
The previous match of Kouvola did not go as planned.
Kevin Belingon, a Philippines, hit Tauru in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never been so up and running: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It's been really bad for a long time.
New motivation
Some freelancers take on once a year, some rise more often in the ring.
For example, the future opponent, Issa, took the last time in September.
The Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now there's another struggle for the year ahead.
Sometimes the pace's gotten pregnant.
In recent years, I've trained and been in good shape all the time.
But all I've ever done is take care of it.
When a 32-year-old heard of a future encounter, she decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo, and I got the pleasure of doing it back.
We got real good training when there was a guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, for on Saturday the Kouvolian will have to prepare for physical struggle.
I've been able to train against the same-size opponents and practice a vertical match.
I mean, being strong is a 32-year-old playback.
We have to hit him rationally.
If there's a chance, I'm going to take the property myself.
You can't give under-exports for free, because they spend the most.
Macao attracts Tauru, who used to be in China.
I hear it's China Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, nice night ahead.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0,25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that it keeps interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been ineffective and inflation reduction has stopped speculation on interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue slowly, and the Bank has transferred interest payments because of the increasing pressure on the income level of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee decided to hold interest rates at 0.25%, which received less support this month, as economic growth has been ineffective.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank decreased its growth forecast to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6 per cent; it also warned that more pressure on income levels in households is expected to continue to increase to close to three per cent in the autumn.
However, in the coming years, the Bank stated that interest payments are needed to control inflation accelerated by Brexit, and the bank also indicated that the loan costs could be increased more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that was started one year ago in the after-election of the Brexit people.
The Bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is expected that it will now be providing low-cost financing to banks for a total of £15 million, i.e. a total of 115 million.
The report of the Bank's interest rate decision states: "In the coming years, according to the Commission's forecast, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue as the decline in real income in households will reduce consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the bank reiterated the need for "a few degrees of monetary consolidation" to control inflation in the "lower" market expectations.
The markets currently predict the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases are "a step-by-step" and "limited".
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9 % for this year and an increase of 1.7 % for next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pun went down in front of the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
In relation to the dollar, the pound fell by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31 per cent, which was 0.4 per cent lower than the euro and EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after the expected weaker growth rates fluctuated expectations of interest rates, which increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but it slightly shakes at the end of the year.
The recent inflation review gave only a small amount of hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and the bank says that the situation is worse before it becomes better.
However, the bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent the decline of income in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to recover "markly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of weak prices, which will reverse part of the reduction in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the calculation of interest rates to 0,25% after the vote results of the EU citizen, which fell into the fall of the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start at prices and economy only after four years.
Before the most recent decision of the Central Bank, interest payments had started to be subject to an increasing volume of demand when inflation blackmailed the pressure on households, and three decision-makers called for a 0,5 % interest rate in July.
In the last month, inflation decreased to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the bank it was expected that inflation would once again increase in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess of the target of 2% was due to a weak weight of "total".
"In view of the recent decline in swap interest rates, competition on the mortgage market would seem to be becoming more intense when creditors are hot-stamping customers and want to end strongly the year," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Markinas look particularly good to those whose current loan agreement is about to end. The latest contracts are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also no costly options available."
NHS will prescribe 10 000 controversial HIV medicines.
As of September, patients may be prescribed a 'returnable' HIV anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute on the financing of the drug in the UK Public Health System (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed for approximately 10,000 people during the first three years of study. Before the concomitant medicinal product has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in individuals at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Justice held the Supreme Court’s judgment last year, which states that NHS is able to pay for the PRESS medicine, even though it is claimed that the local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, director of NHS, called the decision "a significant new intervention" on Thursday, and the National AIDS Organisation described it as "a critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield begin to receive initial registrations to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Prior treatment for pre- exposure prevention (PrEP) should be initiated prior to co-ordination with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that Prep significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
Prior to co-administration, the medicinal product means that there is sufficient medicinal products in the body during co-administration to prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transsexuals, and people with HIV positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics choose the conditions for the trial to be met by applicants for men, women and transsexuals, and for those who are not known to receive antiretroviral therapy by an HIV-positive partner.
People living in England and applying for general medical treatment may also apply for an experiment with their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million, and UK NHS signed a contract on medicinal products this week after an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of this experiment is to assess the potential of the PRESS medicinal product by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its exposure, intake and treatment implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and more effective ways of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"It is another remarkable achievement in the struggle for over 30 years to resolve the greatest health challenge in mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Head of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If the PrEP treatment is properly addressed to those who need it and are members of the risk groups, it may have a reversible effect on their anti-HIV epidemics in England.
From September onwards, the risk group will receive a medicine financed by the NHS, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with the partner, which will have an effect that needs to improve the lives of a great many people.
This was welcome to the news."
"Now the most important thing is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one of the risk groups falls outside it," says Ian Green, director of Terrence Higgins.
"The PrEP medicine to be used for trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people from HIV infection."
"The beginning of the PreEP experiment is a welcome event, which prolonged in vain over several months due to the slowing of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Health at the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a reversible effect on our work to prevent HIV and to end the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of the PREP medicine.
It is important now that the experiment is launched as soon as possible in the whole country, so that we can protect people exposed to HIV and reach a step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been successfully halted."
Quality of life: the intermediate layer and smart interior solutions have made a small home for Earl's Court
The former banker of real estate renovation JoanneLegh moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's stylish house, and the success of the Remont tells us that Joanne hasn't yet packed and altered her campaigns.
"before living with my ex-husband in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to this apartment show and found that the rooms were as high as my apartment.
"I was delighted right away, and I made an offer on the same day."
Since then, about 90 square apartments have experienced a complete transformation of shape.
It was a double where the bedroom only got out of the kitchen, and Joanne wanted to have more storage space and an intermediate floor so that the room height could be used.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed Design Office in Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to make use of almost four meters of the height of the rooms and to create an apartment that would not only be a repair and sale site but a home.
Room height was not enough to double the space, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where it could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are pretty complicated.
The facilities had to be organised in such a way that they did not need to be used to cry.
The structures had to be edited in such a way that the height is just right both on and below."
Erfan was able to place two full rooms with fascinating details overlapping the space.
In the middle floor, the Retrouvius copper-scaned window opens up to a stylish living space.
The hidden furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a typical style.
The use of mirrors will bring a feeling and light to the state.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor make the corridor seem to be longer.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view to another room.
The entrance to the mirror-top furniture has a storage space for Joanna’s meals and glassware.
More style is the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when it's not used.
The kitchens equipped with the art door are not a new solution,
But Joanne's kitchen is unique to the fact that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took some planning," says Erfan, about the steel-tight MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it'll slip very easily when it's lifted."
With intensive use and storage space design, Joanne received 16 extra squares, another bedroom and a better base solution.
"When you sell the property, the area will solve – or the valuation of the property", says Erfan.
"In the case of real estate broker walks into the apartment and drops the price on the basis of the surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the room.
"The customer is in contact with the housing materials, and the emotional link to the dwelling is partly based on them", says Erfan.
"No one climbed into the walls of electrical lines.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and additional bodies can make the basic dwelling exceptionally fine.
Then it may also be that you don't want to move out of your apartment anymore.
Princess Sofia, who was pregnant, was radiant in her summer story.
Princess Sofia's hometown was hit by a button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before she was born.
At dinner at the Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented a smiler on the occasion.
Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Sweden's Båstad this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a wonderful blue body-sucking outfit that was wonderfully wearing the last pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived in a dark blue neighborhood.
This is the last mission in which Sofia is represented before she was born.
His calculated time is in September.
For dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue dress was great as a princess.
Sofia has been to Sweden on a representation trip this week.
Sofia's full of people living in a small bag.
Sofia was just beaming up in her fresh summer story.
Sofia got excited to even talk to photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding on to my stomach, Sofia said I'm laughing, and she's referring to the rest of her pregnancy.
He's raising us with a sweet chill.
In the summer of 1996, a home appeared on Lahti’s market where Thai food was sold.
The Lahtans didn't dare try. They walked by.
At home, the food sold by Panya Suamsri-Pettilä, among the people I know, Panya.
He did not know much Finnish, and at that time the Finns did not yet know Thai.
Because people didn't dare go out and eat, Panja offered free corn.
This is how he taught the sects to eat Thai food, spring rolls at a time.
Try it, he said.
I got caught up in the box.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai restaurant at the Lahti Chamber of Commerce.
It's got two small tables, and I think there were less than 20 of them.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the stranger.
When you're hungry and places are limited, you can't leave empty chairs between yourself and a guest.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with the dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went to the store hall, but then the restaurant had to move because the spices made itself were too much to get in the hall.
A new place was released at the end of the Chamber of Commerce.
There's room.
Now we jurors can sit back in our tables, only in the more congested times will we have to ask the guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows her client.
They're telling him what's been going on and who's been seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He's seen how the customer's life stages vary and the food company changes.
He remembers what kind of man I went to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me as thin and fat, and remembers what I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the rest of us, sit next to the kitchen door, and change the memberships with Panya who leans in the dishes.
Food is not the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chilic.
In addition to our taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about Thai, thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panya.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's hard.
He's going to have to go to the restaurant. He's going to be in the mushrooms and in the blue.
Last week the restaurant was celebrated with a slight fulfillment of the two decades.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this big day went by work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were willing to strike in Europe
Security authorities received an important list of anti-terrorist work from the beginning.
The list includes more than 170 Isis combatants who are willing to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt, the total number of persons is 173, and the document also includes pictures of each person, in addition to their personal data.
Of the persons mentioned in the list, more than 130 are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikis and Saudi Arabia.
Night-night-sanot told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been revised.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army's special forces found the identity of the terrorists and the images contained a list of the terrorists in the investigation of the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosu.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the paper's authenticity and sent it to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in European countries in May.
There was fear in the background that something big and serious would be designed by terrorists in Western lands, by Isis, to fall in the Middle East.
In addition to the names and images of all persons, according to Die Welt, there is also a list of their date of birth, acquiess, and information about the person’s country of residence.
The list has also defined terrorist specialities.
For example, the 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads Abu Assid al-Alman as a fighting name, or German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then Libya, and later through Turkey to Syria to join Isis.
It's written next to his photo as a special form of suicide bomber.
There's nothing more specific about what a man's fate is.
A total of about 6 000 fighters have left Europe, with no certainty of their fate.
The man fell below the surface in the Tokoinran region of Helsinki
Based on interviews from the rescue department, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a dying spirit.
In the Tokoinranta of Helsinki, the person who was under water was saved on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the fireman of the Helsinki rescue department, the situation was quickly over.
A person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue diver found him underneath the surface, says Estlander.
The rescue facility received a report after 4:30 this afternoon.
The person was delivered to the primary care unit.
Estlander says he was about 50 years old.
The interviews showed him wanted to show him he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinra is over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was the role of the Border Guard.
Those in attendance also guided divers finely.
It was over in 15 minutes.
He was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars came across in Eura, nine people, three seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of which had less injuries, says the sun mate fireman.
There are both men and women among the injured.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads at four o'clock in the day.
Kolari happened when another car turned into a three-way car in front of another car, says the sundry fireman.
According to the rescue facility, there is a speed limit of 80 km per hour in the cross-border area.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers challenge Victoria's biggest real estate experiment worth more than 500 million dollars, which is connected to their Italian family 40 years ago to set up a family business.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court to challenge the division of property and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family company since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
Brothers and their mother Anna, together, own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars. The family began to acquire property when they bought a store in the Smith Street of Collingwood in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store that extended to 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for properties, and the family now owns offices, development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to the agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul describes his father as "the leading force and central character of the family".
According to the legal documents, the distribution ratio of property means that Colin owns property worth approximately $316 million and Paul owns approximately $1 176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left his proposal for the best real estate for himself," Paul wrote in his first oath to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with for the first time in the highest court last Friday after several conciliation firms.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
According to Colin, the argument is not true, and he's blaming Paul for some of the bad management of some real estate.
Colin writes together about his first oaths that he would like to make a decision on the matter.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me," Colin says in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of statements, e-mails and reports that are constantly increasing. The case is about discussing consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian migrants who founded milk bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as a insurance policy when buying a property from Collingwood where Colin set up his first jeans store.
Colin says that he founded a trade "in the last years of the lock-up when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the properties to their sons in a friendly way.
"The thought often stated that they did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna wrote in her statement.
The family's two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "scrap the economic conditions of their departure".
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is former member of Australia’s football club’s Board of Directors and the best friend of Eddie McGuire, in 2015 according to the time of his life.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and he said in his text message that it cannot be correctly commented on because it is dealt with in a court of law.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family's name into a court fight," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued and said he still hoped that we would be able to find a solution.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"We're going to be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the use of the President's media.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the new Head of Staff of the White House intends to restrict President Trump's media and news surveillance so that the boss does not get into trouble so often.
Editor Josh Dawsey report:
"When the new Head of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the executive staff on his first working day, he spoke about the key problem he was going to resolve: he is going to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the workers of the White House that all the information, whether printed or consulted, must be carried through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has for decades an affair with television — and as President he still looks at television.
"If President Trump was nervous about unfair news, he was encouraged to show that the generous media discussed things more evenly", Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser for the Trump campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico's journalist Tara Palmer wrote at that time that "an earlier six campaign workers say that it is essential to manage Trump's Twitter use that his personal media flow includes a smooth flow of circuits".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump's Twitter has never been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that we others do not know — perhaps Trump’s twitters would have been even more charming without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left unsolicited.
If his staff has even a few times been able to prevent his problems, their work has not been unnecessary.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent the miscarriage caused by Trump.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their affairs by providing Trump with information that supports their vision. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately give the President questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"The modern and former workers of the drum say that he can be enormously angry with journalisms in which he is criticised – especially if they tell of harmful data leaks, and then he must know exactly where the information comes from.
That was at the end of February when someone deliberately gave the president a copy of the news of Charles C. Johnson's GotNews.com website, founded by the White House, which was accused of several reports by Deputy Head of Staff Katie Walsh.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and later withdrawn them. Nor did he present any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the case, Trump had begun to ask about Walsh as a personal agent."
Goldmacher added that the then Head of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for the management of documents that go to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants will continue to drive their own affairs.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian lawyer, Neymar, has entered into a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Formerly on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona on the league of Spain.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona was therefore dissolved and was free to move to PSG.
The amount of the transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in the history of football.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which paid 105 million euros last summer for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned qatarian company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis pro, qatarilainen Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
A successful author, Raija Orane, turned alcoholism and flying fear on hypnosis: "I'm in my life"
From the TVs, Rose's time and Clean white sheets known as the successful writer Raija Orane just spent her 69th anniversary.
The hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to the writing, five grandchildren love grandmas that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winter.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring, the rental flat also left.
To light and to the sun, away from the old circles Raija took away in time depression and alcoholism from which she has survived.
The outer being is also 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin medicines were discontinued, they were mood medications.
I once got help with the hypnosis, which also made me a flyer, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a sparkly writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Orane have traveled the same way for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Orane have worked together for more than 40 years.
I had a case, and it was getting married in two weeks, and Raija's laughing.
She's always been such a drama queen, and she's stopped living that, and Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Only in good 44 parts of the pure white sheets on TV series that touched and moved the recession in Finland.
I finally decided to join the Raika family company in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50-year interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of the ompelist myself, my mother also had the clothing business, and sometimes I act as a mannequin, Orane recalls.
He said that a series of plots and that story changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and claim revealed it, Orane says.
Raija Orane lives as author of active time, she has many manuscripts under the job - hundreds of ideas.
The Kiertos returned over the fence to the "millionaire alley"
The houseowners of West Midlands’ wealth are once again on a suffocating table with self-sufficient circulars who managed to cross over the city’s desired path and return to the next field of the houses.
The Kiertos parked 20 of their trailer near the street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the chain of clothing that they needed to travel to the municipality and brought with them children, horses and vans to the army.
The Kiertos managed to cross the road barrier at a point that had not been protected because of the path.
Indicted residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells of the circulars coming on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had cast passers by stone.
"It has to be hard to work because it seems to be completely unable to solve the problem.
The Kiertos were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today."
The resident told me that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay the municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another unnamed resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There's more to them than before, and they've even calculated a horse to put them in the park."
According to Solihull County Reporter, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull Police to evicte the campers as soon as possible.
From the point of view of collecting evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report to the police about disturbing or criminal activities.
It will help to create a comprehensive picture of the situation in order to deal with legal proceedings."
The destroyed people surrounded the Portuguese wreckage machine
Men who were forced to land on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
As a result of the forced landing, two people died yesterday.
The two men who fly the plane may be charged with the death penalty.
In Portugal, at least 16 years of imprisonment can be obtained.
A small plane by men had to make a forced landing yesterday due to a technical failure on the shores of Sao Joao da Cabarica, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the event period, some of which ran the landing machine into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and eight-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit a man who was back on the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane rose up, and when it landed again, it hit the kid's head, told Philip Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The dead little girl was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents didn't get hurt.
On the beach, those were surrounded by a small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
Her father and other people went to the plane and started beating after it, told Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, who witnessed the incident.
He called a pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
Two men on the plane didn't get hurt in forced landing.
The tragically lost Finnish star won another MM gold: "I would not be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamar celebrates early Wednesday morning Finland’s time for the MM-gold slalm in Canada’s Big White competition.
Big Hamari won World Cup earlier in the contests.
In all, the MM-tits have already been collected by three.
It's a pretty incredible World Competition!
Two times the gold was handled, with a pretty good heart to be drawn, the Great Hamari, who was made on the phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old-in-the-year-old thanked her coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to the Great Hamari, the number of interviewers in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralumililatation has grown and developed so much recently.
The differences are falling, and there are a lot of new counters involved.
I always wonder if there's a black horse coming after him.
Every race seems to be a different winner.
Major Hamari lost his other leg in a motor cycle accident in 2009.
Since he was a young man, he had been eagerly down with his friends, and the accident did not want to get to the front.
It reminds me of how my life would be without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's no use for the josts.
They're playing what's been shared on those cards. Big Hamari is pressing.
It would be cruel to have a serious accident and to lose the rage for a lucky shot, and the Great Hamari will not do it.
But he turned on the terrible difficulty.
Yes, I would say that things turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, Big Hamari's biggest plates were already slipping.
It's not until after the accident.
I used to train when I was young with guys, and we always killed X-Games.
But they were distant wounds, which bitten over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there at the start of the X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to break up and surf.
I decided to pull the hammers in the neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The charger was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
A four-time Olympic winner received his prize at the January sports gala.
According to the Great Hamari, star victory is an important signal for the para-sports.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will open your eyes to the para-sports world.
Since it's time to launch a two-year-old world champion, Matti Big Hamari, the athlete campaign of the year?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
And yet the Great Hamari have not conquered all of its lustful peaks.
Next year, a great goal will be set.
A year later, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
We're gonna go get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland unless war has ended and Isis leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refgues survey examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syria's refugees cooking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland.
They believe that the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump regime does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication office chain Burson-Marsteller examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has already studied the views and attitudes of Arabs in nine years.
This year's A Voice for Young Syrian Refgues survey examined the opinions and attitudes of the Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February to March 2017, the survey accounted for a total of 400 Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half of men.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the survey, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland in the future.
42% of respondents may think that they would return to their homeland and 4% did not know what to say.
According to the survey, the greatest impact of the young people's return to the country is the ongoing war in Syria, as well as the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) sees the end of the war as the most important factor in permanent return, while one quarter considers it important to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth of them make up the main factors affecting the decision to improve the economic situation or leave Syria of Bashar al-Assad.
Military measures alone do not resolve conflict
Syrians were asked what is the most important factor in the decision-making of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than giving up President Bashar al-Assad.
A real quarter considers Al Assad's presidency an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Almost half will experience the need for both political and military solutions to end the Syrian conflict now under way.
The resolution of the conflict by military action alone does not believe in a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see that Isis has weakened power in the last year, while the fifth is experiencing a strengthening of its power.
According to the defendants, the most important battle against Jesse is that the media conveys to people information that Islam has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many raised military measures as a priority and education reform.
In the opinion of the 10th of fair, the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asking about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump period.
The ideas are divided in two respects as to whether Russia and Iran's involvement have improved or made the conflict worse.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coded to keep the Internet in order - his database developed, for example, is used by Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB, Espoo, develops an open source database "the fastest growing in the world".
The main product of the MariaDB founded by Michael "Monty" Widenius is not paid to users at all, and it can be developed via the Internet by anyone who is a pro-active programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are Finnish database users, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there" explains Widenius.
The Widenius, the director of MariaDB's technology, spends about half of his time coded.
A man making distances from the beautiful hands will help to ensure that the Internet operates in a smooth way.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database of MySQL together with Swedes David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and one year later, the software left Oracle at Sun with 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle store happened, a large part of the MySQL developers told me they were leaving.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not make a sure promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company to develop MariaDB at this stage.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired a twenty-five best developer from Sun to make sure that the code was continued with the help of the same friends who created it.
As MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A Foundation was established to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"In the course of MySQL, these assurances were not made," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billions, few Finns know nothing about MariaDB.
"Our growth rate has been about 50% per year for the last few years," says Kenneth Paqvalén, director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, who focuses on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is obsessive about the company's characteristics.
To that extent, he reveals that during the current accounting period, MariaDB estimated that it would receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free of charge, the company has developed its services around which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB will also help exchange databases, which can be a career over a year if the customer has used a closed database.
My mission is to switch to MariaDB in a few moments, because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the largest bank in the Spanish operator Telephonica and South-East Asia are the customers paying by the MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Aliba Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even if we're a small firm, we have contacts with the biggest fields.
Among our clients are the world's largest telecommunications operators, gambling companies, banks and even a small central bank, Paqvalé.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with closed databases.
Even Oraclele MySQL is a modest side business compared to the traditional closed database of the company.
Although Gartner's research firm said that the largest database companies have lost market shares in recent years, players such as MariaDB in turnover are still worthless, though fast growing seals.
For about 50 billion dollars in database markets, open source databases do not even reach billions.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured in cash only because the majority of users are not paid for any of these software.
The research firm Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched open or at least started.
Large companies will not receive new clients because most will then choose an open source code.
This has led to the completion of the cloud of licence fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to be with lower customer numbers," Widenius wonders.
Since the exchange of the closed database is incomplete, the majority of customers have listened to price increases.
"There are a lot of customers who have a very difficult transition, because their old applications and others are closed up in the database," Widenius says.
He still thinks the size of his clients is coming up full.
When license fees rise every year, the customer will move sooner or later into the database of the open source code.
The price is 10-20 per cent above, and the service is better because, if you wish, you can easily switch to another database.
Moreover, many companies face major changes in their systems when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million of loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth fund ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now meaning to hire more.
One reason for the financing of the EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros per year for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently", Paqvalén says.
Widenius is upset about how money is spent in Finland, for example, on closed health care systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say the open source code is ideological, but I think it's a better way to make the code.
The community helps and does something that is not invented or capable of doing.
55-year-old Widenius belongs to another Finnish developer, Linux developer, Linus Torvalds, along with the best known promoters of open source code.
Widenius helps other companies develop operating business models on an open source code.
I still hold 4-5 speeches each year around the world on this subject.
Italy's attitude towards civil society rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs who, on their ships, will rescue refugees in the Mediterranean that they will not continue their activities unless they undertake to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new policy, it is difficult to see how they can continue their activities," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, during an interview with the Torino La Stampa newspaper.
Minnit’s warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German Jugend Rettet, who is suspected to have cooperated with human secretaries, which promoted illegal immigration.
Only for a year did the aid organisation refuse to comment on the detailed accusations of the prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization announced in its opinion on social media.
"We can only assess the charges when we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
Since October, the Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of the Jugend Rettet organisation.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board a ship by boat refugees directly from secretors who were re-emerged.
One of these cases is said to have occurred just a few miles from the Libya coast, and the information appears in the Public Prosecutor's document, the contents of which have been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have threatened the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the region, which is a motive for helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be accompanied by an Italian police officer monitoring operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the code of conduct: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
on Thursday, he announced that he would consider new rules unnecessary but acceptable, as they do not create "markable changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refuse to comply with the code of conduct are Nobel-paid Doctors without a border organisation.
Mr Minnit, for his part, pointed out that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply over the last few weeks, as he considers it to be a sign that actions to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local city leaders are beginning to produce results.
"In the last days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He pointed out that this month there will be discussions with the city leaders of Libya on economic development projects and measures with Chad, Niger and Mali to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
A seasonal worker suspected of being killed at Enontekiö, suspected of being found in the country, case to the prosecutor.
A suspected crime occurred in the Kutes of Enontekike last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech-year-old man is suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish common-law.
It's been said in the past that both of them were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that after what they did, the suspect would have fled to the country with two dogs.
A man was found cold in the ground, and he didn't make the resistance when he was caught.
We need to press charges in less than a week.
The case may still be covered in Lapland’s main rights during August.
Robert Hardy, known as Harry Potter and my All-Feared Friends, is dead.
The British actor Robert Hardy is dead when he was 91.
The actor's death was reported by this family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started her acting career at a 24-year-old theater.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter movies and for his veterinary role in the TV series of my friend James Herriot, based on the book of James Herriot.
A total of seven were described by the BBC's popular series.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for text messages instigated by suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that she was considered to have inspired her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, execute 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced to murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family's broken," Conrad's father said at the Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an amendment to the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was sentenced to 20 years, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a creamy sweater, listened to his judgment on the cross with a weeping look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the D.A. said to the court.
"He chose Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility," the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was due to "disgusting circumstances that Carter deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz considered that Carter's "age or maturity level" and not even mental problems had a significant impact on his actions".
The D.A. read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, where she said, "It's not gonna take a day to hear my dear son's death.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I survive all of this. I try to do my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister Camdy's Roy told the court that she's "stressing" the idea that she'll never see her brother's wedding and not be Auntie to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never ease", said Camdy.
The case seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts to commit suicide as a criminal offence.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a cage in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter, in his text messages, had prompted his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Trust yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know how many ways there are", Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent to Roy in the past two weeks before he died. Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter applied for attention by means of Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the views of experts.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper, which he says, "Michelle Carter needs sympathy and help, no prison."
Secretary-General of NATO: Intermediate Russia's worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented on the Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship to Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Mr Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, in particular, since the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to operating in such a way that tensions do not become high.
As long as we are strong and predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid agitating the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, President of the United States Donald Trump was able to say that there was even a dangerous poor level between the US and Russia.
Trump urged to thank the countries for their poor avoid­ing Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
The audit will make changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a back-up experienced by car manufacturers
Day before Aud's announcement BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The manager of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more rational alternatives than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including BMW’s home city of Munich, which consider limiting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about a call back.
European car manufacturers have been strongly marketing diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve the CO2 targets.
Nitrogen emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The costs of installation of emissions neutralizing equipment will rise, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of helping large car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, and Volkswagen put in cars scam machines that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations, and in ordinary driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Aud engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn up in a criminal investigation on Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that it had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emission standards, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The investigation of Aud can significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the share of the luxury car manufacturer's winnings on Volkswagen is disproportionate.
The vote in Venezuela began to reflect, with big demonstrations in the permit.
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election performance, said Tibisay Lucan, Chairman of the National Election Commission.
Maduro convinces the crisis to end
A delegation was elected in Venezuela on Sunday to amend the Constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its demonstrations in such a way that they are in progress at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces of the country began to take over the country's parliamentary building on Wednesday night.
The members are to ensure the security of the appointment room.
Climate change threatens Proven lavenge
Laventel has become a symbol of the Province of Southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender had decreased due to drought and disease - scientists and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventel is directly threatened in the Province of Provence because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a clear reduction in the rainfall of spring and especially autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert on agriculture specialist in Provence.
"This will shorten the lifetime of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought into the area a lot of small sauces that spread microbacteries."
The bets are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a very desirable ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
"In the absence of quilts and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or are missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, the elements containing essential oil are even less."
The solution is applied for by improving watering, slowing down soil moisture and spraying plants with protective clay and water mixture.
The murder of the supplier reflects the growing threat in Mexico
One week’s Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and an endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, safety is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists will discuss which one is safer: to leave the children at home or to include them in the delivery of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking suppliers to name each group, and they don't need proof, observations and feelings are enough.
They write to the Board the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and suppliers suspected of being on the pay list of governments or drug cartels, and they are criminals making Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
According to the Committee on Consumer Protection, at least 25 suppliers have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. In December 2012, the federal defense has 589 suppliers who are subject to attacks and threats. In the past year, at least seven suppliers have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, journalist and source of inspiration.
"It's a mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist", Valdez wrote one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The Riodoce building’s public mouth covers a huge picture of Valdez’s middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice." The 30-year suppliers Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts, which are cleaned by Valdez with a smile on their faces. Valdez has eyeglasses and a trade mark formed in a panhat.
The meeting will be held less than two months after the death of Valdez. Journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fear of being paranoid.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up, in particular for the processing of journalists' cases, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers, only two charges have been raised so far.
Journalists' murderers rarely go to justice, as well as thousands of deaths related to drug trafficking and organised crime annually only rarely end up in court.
Riodoce journalists are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are broken and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is only a little useful because the killers are not aware and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is quite a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the event."
Valdez had withdrawn from the delivery of Riodoce in the capital of the state in Culiacan on 15.5.2017.
He had driven only a few blocks in his red Tokyo when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is supposed to be linked to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away with Valdez's car, and then he broke it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She died of a wife and two adult children.
The rumors are moving fast and they're free to roll in Culiacan.
But the death of Valdez is a mouse silence.
Sinaloa has been the most bloody battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled from the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are being shot to death every day, and the cemetery has two-storey tomb buildings that are bigger than many houses.
In the state on the coast, there is a "gold" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez, 60 years old, feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a competing group that's running a war against Guzman's boys.
The case could make the sons of Guzman angry: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every number of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the point of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after the attack of another newspaper who issued the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many times that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had done a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodoce. At that time, shares were sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem," Bojorquez says.
In time, the newspaper began to know its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish high-class scientific journalism without fear of sensualism, and readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its news in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez received an international press release award from the defense committee for his courage to follow Mexico's drug trade story without persuading.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the award of the supplier's defence committee.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is the "life style", Valdez said at the interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The artist must accept the mission falling down upon him – or act stupid.
I don’t want anyone to ask me where I was when death was bathed here — why didn’t I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce personnel need Valdez – a joker who cursed like a port worker. They miss a friend, who always received hugs and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always used a pancake.
He was at the opposite El Guyabo bar, and he was always sitting on the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best they can do their jobs and stay alive.
"The criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of business," says Bojorquez.
In the best case, it meant strong self-sensus and self-protection;
trust in your own instincts.
If it feels like everything's not right, we need to stay away.
According to Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the vacuum can be deceived, and that's what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is changing constantly.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce was trained for safety, and a few days earlier it had become apparent that only spy programs for governments had been monitored by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied to the shadow of the tree for protection from 40°C.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodoce premises located in a four-floor building in the middle-class region of Culiacan.
Some of the suppliers considered half of their play whether these two cops belonged to the 50% not considered reliable by the governor of the state.
It had been months since the journalists had been in the mountainous countryside controlled by drug gangs.
This week's number, Riodoce's delivery was up to three main things.
The boxing size of Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The press also intended to reveal that government spending had been concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, only a block away from the Public Prosecutor's Office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about it, who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to be careful: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and public authorities.
The supplier found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered with the name of a politician belonging to the dominant institutional revolution party (PRI). PRI has managed Mexico's policy at all levels almost a century ago.
It has recently been accused of corruption in cases of widespread publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. One of them was "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid the military horse.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they had reliable information on the Valdez column of the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received the nickname "El Flaco", Ohio.
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse, which preserves signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists.
The editor, Miriam Ramirez, took a few signs with him the next morning when he left the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration that was responsible for the murder of another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the Western state of Michacan three days after Valdez was murdered.
After disappearing, the body that was burned was found, and based on the DNA tests from the authorities, it was Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In the demonstrations, "SOS Press" texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he tries to receive international support for Valdez's case investigation.
On the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
Since then, he has asked to be moved away from government cases because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime, the authorities allowing crime, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed in agreement with organised crime by politicians and security forces.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were police and public authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
The murders have a decomposing effect.
No one forgets the death of a blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulpas border state six years ago.
His body had a message signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here for my writing."
By his cut-off head, there was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to end their activities, such as El Norte newspaper in the north of Chihuahua border State, post-murder Miroslava Breach.
Some will continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on his front page to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some suppliers have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a tough decision.
It's hard to find work on the land, and we need to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a journalist in their hands, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 for three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — one that was to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago Riodoce’s journalists sat in front of the delivery on Friday at midnight with a beer on the sidewalk when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly their phones began to mark the color of the message.
In the shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people were killed at the shores of Maztlan.
The war accelerated, as was promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put the news on Riodoce’s website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
We had to re-schedule our home the next day.
The sirens slumber in the vicinity – again another shooting scene.
Mr. Bojorquez took a look at the delivery of security officers:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce continued the tradition of the deceased founder of the magazine under this massive image, where a man shows the middle finger for all of Sinalo.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about ending the operation. "How can I stop the magazine when our intern asked me to do a case on the street on the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback...
In April 39, Hannu Manninen’s party was short, because the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic Games.
However, the training season started disastrously when Manninen got infected with the flu.
It started a long period of illness, which took nearly five weeks.
In practice, May went completely sick.
At first there was a flu and finally a paediatric disease like an ear infection that I had to eat with an antibiotic.
I could only do 10% of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been so ill for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn't get used to practice, but Manninen's gonna tell Ilta-Sanom.
The test result collapsed
The world champion of 2007 only received a training permit in the second week of June, which was seen in the KIHU’s roller screens of the Research Centre of Kilpa and High Sports, which took place on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers with carpets, with speed increasing every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester takes a milk sample from the athlete’s fingertip needle.
Last fall, I had 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I'm only 28 minutes.
It's against the wall. Manninen's gonna tell me.
Right direction
After the initial rights, Manninen tells me he's been healthy.
I've been doing a wide range of peaceful aerosol exercises that I've been trying to normalize your body's metabolism.
It's a really good five-week period.
There was also a half a week's vacation from flight work.
I got to go to the cabin with my family.
In the last season, Manninen only participated in four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen in the opening contest when Manninen got up at the top 18th grade.
Guidelines withdrawn
Mr Petter Kukkonen, head of the Manninen and the national team, has made a training and competition plan which extends until February next year.
We are now looking for different rhythms compared to last year's practice.
After the first rounds, Ruka would have a three- World Cup weekend.
In December, at least one of the world cups would be present during the weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still have something to do with Seefeld.
I hope you find the name after that on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
The Olympics in Pyeongchang would already be the sixth Winter Olympics in their career.
The most important thing now is to remain healthy in Salt Lake City, the Nummelan subline celebrated in the 2002 gold team race.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
The researchers have now revealed the first research results of the discovery of the Canadian miner of a vervain of a creature so well preserved that the experts would call it the dinosaur Mona In addition.
It had remained so well that researchers could even determine that its skin was red-brown and had a "problemed past".
According to Current Biology, it has been the best ever preserved armored dinosaur and the best of its species in the world.
Recently found fossil is the nodosaurus, which lived between 110 and 12 million years ago during the mid-term of the accession period.
Researchers consider this amazingly well preserved fossil a truly remarkable discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, pansarized vegetable feed has been best preserved in its species for all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was the mining man named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that seemed not to be a natural part of the rock around him and decided to explore his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's royal paleontological museum.
There, for six years, the beast was dug out of a pack of 1,100 kilos.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you turn your eyes on, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a scientist at Tyrrell's Royal Museum.
"It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
The leather studies found that the dinosaurs that ate meat were likely a significant threat to this herbivore, even though it had a armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masked its predators and also protected it from darker and lighter coloring, which still exists on many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to mix with its environment and avoid enemies, major dinosaurs.
110 million years old nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May, and it is now exhibited at Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
According to Mark Mitchell, scientists have named Borealope Markmitchell museum engineer. Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig the dinosaur out.
The Nodosaurus has remained so amazing that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body's dust and armor.
They found that it still protected the animal world by general coloring, where the body was darker and lighter.
However, the finding was a surprise because Borealope is much greater than the present animals with a similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs eating the meat were telling it to the extent that evolution favoured survival as a means of hiding instead of fighting.
In modern animals, for example, peuros, zebras and armadillos have similar colours, which are much smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs were for the accession season," Brown says.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the nodosaur salts reveals that its skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study nodosaurus to draw conclusions from its life, including its contents, to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Scientists believe that when they died, it fell into the river and drove to the sea, where it sunk on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really important because its Finnish skin has been preserved and has also survived in its original three-dimensional form", Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early period.
Its illustration does not require much imagination: you can almost believe that it was asleep."
The joining season was the age of teropods, the vast two-legged dinosaurs that eat meat.
Although their king, Tyrrannosaurus rex, or millions of years earlier, Borealopopleta, its mighty predecessors may have captured this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex’s predecessors were, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, about 11,5 meters long six-ton monster.
The latest findings of the Nodosaur researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, and they believe that Borealopo was washed up after the death of the sea and mutated into the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was the mining man named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it has been best preserved in the world from the grave of dinosaur skins and tanks to the hips.
The Nodosaurs were, on average, five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
They had a two-foot drop out of their ships.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetable feed went through the current Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved little details, including in a sea-based grave.
Its fossilized residues are so well preserved that its skin remains in the armored plates along its skull.
In the National Geographic magazine Michael Greshko wrote that maintaining this kind of thing is "one rare as a lottery gain.
The more you look at it, the more surprising it feels.
There are still fossilised skins in the plastic plates of that skull.
Its right interest is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count its footsaws."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: Who does the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked by 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat in his Airbnb's apartment in bed watching Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The police just killed a 18-year-old kid, and his body is still on the street."
Desperately, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his input. Therefore, he closed on Facebook and opened the Twitter.
His timeline had numerous reviews from @TheePharoah.
The user's name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis, who twitted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the white police had shot an innocent 18-year-old black Brown's Ferguson in Missour State.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he came back to Twitter later that night, people were told he was gathering for Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of a cop's armpit and screaming people, and Brown's father, a man who claimed to be his father, who was carrying the sign, saying, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video where the police were standing in front of the protestors with a barking dog.
He's also saying he saw a video where another cop set up his rifle and shouted, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal", Ferrell remembers that he's verified.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've already used to, and it could be said to be typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
Ferrell came to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years has been a documentary film "Whose Streets"? It was made in film theatres on August 11, 2013.
The film is a story of survival and mental expression, love and loss, and strength and intensity from the point of view of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove toward Ferguson's flower dresser and her daughter in a compatible crown with it, they renegotiated the conversation about "what it is to live in black people and what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers his saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't stay with my daughter," Ferrell told me later.
"This day's events are the peak of events in the past.
My daughter has a right to know it and to grow up in it.
He must be prepared for activation and organisation, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of the experience of living in black, and he must know what we must do to free ourselves.
Although fortunately I have been able to protect him from dirty racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which was located opposite the police station, which became the camp of activists when they waited for information on the case and eventually learned that there was no charge against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to react to activism in a new way.
“Aktivisni changed completely after 9 August,” he says. When he studied at the University of Missour, St. Louis, Ferrell, he was chairman of the organization of medical students belonging to minorities. At that time he concentrated on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organising.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the document in his evening act.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrr "requiring to tell you simply" what was happening.
Ferrell thought of a mischief, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use for good?"
The suspicion was due to countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and its rigidity.
"We had heard that the people born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan recently told us at the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activity among the prisoners who were killed.
Davis' involvement allowed Ferrell to go to the project with six other locals, and the description team followed the events of Brown's shooting in the years that followed.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis says.
"I had the most important thing about how local people were presented in the film because I was presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences because it was intended to show that the movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community".
That is why the document sees surprising private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he told me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the black human image require some vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story once again brings back the role of black women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot a black teenager at Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the league are identical to the queer identity.
"The leadership of the women of black queer has kept the whole movement on," Ferrell says. "It is because we have to keep fighting on many fronts.
Black women with queer have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The law really sustains black women, including women with lots of queer."
He stresses, however, that Ferrell was not selected for "self- purposely" purposes because of its queer identity.
"He's got energy moving," Folayan says.
"It is no coincidence, however, that he was in the front line. Black queer women live in many areas of surgery, and they have a lot in play.
"His energy is transmitted by a white cloth."
The new illustrious groups have long left Ferguson, but the differences between the Community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell has two and a half years of parole left, and he was sentenced to a protest on the motorcycles.
His description of the social climate in his corners is short and hearty: "Successful."
Yet he still trusts the blowout he learned from outside the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our will is to fight our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Suitable consistency: artist creates images of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery in New York has been hanged in the middle of the exhibition space with faces – white, black and brown faces that can be seen more closely between them.
These 30 works are taken by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where he executed his 35-year sentence. Manning was sentenced to leaking classified diplomats on WikiLeaks' website.
Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Recovery exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It has two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a trans-native and career-oriented translator whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced his term to the third day of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyses Manning's DNA from the algorithm and created 30 images based on his genetic data. They are sharp, though a little theoretical position on the ability to modify DNA data, on multiplicity and on the underlying causative consequences of interpretations, and on identity.
Chelsea Manning, born in Bradley Edward, has openly told us that he has been related to women since the break-in. In 2013, he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including the violation of the law of spying, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a yellow, black-and-white self, where a troubled Manning sits in the car in the driver's seat.
Dewey-Hagborg had in 2015 a highly popular Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
In it he created images based on criminal technology information, and he received DNA information about, for example, tobacco bombs and gums, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from the Paper Magazine magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told me at a new exhibition press conference.
He couldn't visit Manning and he couldn't shoot him in jail, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he'd be interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned music suddenly became correspondence friends, and they wrote to each other for a few years.
They even did together a Suppressed Images series pictured by Shoili Kangungo. It describes the future in which the president would have alleviated Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama reduced Manning's sentence only a few days after the release of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after the seven tough years of being held in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump goes to his own war against the computerists and the trans-sex soldiers and, on Twitter, he's creating new ways of strengthening the powerful streetrs he actually had to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "all has purpose".
On the wall of the gallery, the artist's statement and under it is a great autograph of Manning, where the name i is the point of the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to "a automatic division with which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
The opposite wall has the Manning DNA sequence: a long line of C, G, and A letters written on the lead pen.
This combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, such as the scientific definition used by the artist – wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least from our biology.
"My exhibition helps people understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. It also shows his Spurious Memories video production from 2007.
"DNA tells a lot of stories, and here's 30 of them."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from the comic book of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
That's Manning's character coming out of jail like King Kong, a megaphone in his hand.
"If they get you quiet, they'll win," says the picture.
"Don't ever bother."
"The art is the letter I received from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive I still get cold colors."
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes in, he was greeted by his face based on his own genetic data as a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, as in all others in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written at lead level, which is the same as its length (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall earlier, but I wanted to bring those crowds to feel," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe Chelsea's mass movement, which was also behind his release."
Professor of Northwestern University and employee of Oxford University are wanted for murder as suspects
Police report that they have launched a national search to find a professor at Northwestern University and a staff member of Oxford University who are suspected of stabling a man in Chicago's luxury apartment.
The case files of Cook County law show that arrest orders were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42 and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleeau, 26, died after he was stabbed several times.
According to local intelligence published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police in the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple scar wounds in her body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranley was found dead at the scene of the event and the stabilization was investigated as a murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiological and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Deputy Director for Social Relations at the University of University, stated in his e-mail opinion that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is the criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as an older financial assistant at Oxford University.
The opinion sent by e-mail by the University of Finland and the Somerville College informant states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and we are prepared to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways."
The opinion also said that Mr Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
The Chicago Police Department's Information Manager Anthony Guglimelim said that he urged suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, and we keep checking our search," Guglim said.
According to Guglim, local, regional and national authorities help with the search for suspects.
He told the police that he had received a call from the Grand Plaza building host who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment of 1008.
The police described the sight at the scene as terrible.
According to Guglimelt, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglimelim.
Grand Plaza's board of directors published the following announcement to the residents: "The question is that we should look into the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up the Islamic book trade and kill the Muslims in London.
"I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm Catholic," the convicted man said to the police.
Moffatt has to perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man has been convicted of threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and kills all Muslims.
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was sentenced to gross harassment, among other things.
According to the police, the bookstore staff called them in on May 23rd.
According to the staff, he was "a man threatened to blow up the book trade and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about threats.
The threat didn't involve book trade events.
The authorities found that Moffatt had dressed up in the same pattern as the suspect in book trade events, the police reporter said.
I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogation.
As punishment, a man has to perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and costs approximately 620 euros of legal expenses and 85 pounds or about 95 euros of compensation for victims.
According to Scotland Yard, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the road map of WADA in the near future" – Vice-President of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Vice-President Vitaly Mutko of Russia has said that Russia will soon complete the WADA Road Map of the World Anti-Doping Office, which will restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
"Some of the road map measures have already been taken, and RUSADA was entitled to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
WADA's road map has been updated in these areas", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which defines the conditions for the return of the mandates of RUSADA. The second part of the Road Map was recently published on the website of the Organization.
According to the report, it does not contain anything worrying about Russia.
"All has been notified, and everything will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
One of the points of the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the investigation carried out by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, appointed by WADA. McLaren investigates the alleged state role in Russian sport doping.
Mutko said: "The research is ongoing because our antidoping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes, and we cannot admit things that did not exist."
Mutkon's words included the echoes of the opinion of Mr Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Russian independent Public Antidoping Commission.
On the same day, Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport Sports Media, admitted that Russia's antidoping institutions had problems. "We have said several times that there are controversial comments and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept this report without condition", but he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping supervision in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of dopingsandal had been revealed.
However, it was authorised in June to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
Olivier Niggli, director of WADA, visited the head office of RUSA in Moscow in July. After the visit, he said that the organization was on the right road towards the return of powers.
British organisation sceptical to Finnish loved innovation: There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packages
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and Guardian say that the Lullaby Trust organization, which is fighting against midwives, prohibits the use of their own brochures in UK-wide maternity packages.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
Lullaby Trust said there's no evidence that a maternity package would reduce the risk of forced death.
A heart attack means an unexplainable sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust acts as an expert of British health authorities with a child’s safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be presented to them, because it would enable us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two dead thousands.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading results from a variety of reasons, such as a small number of teenage babies.
The fact that every family is given a box may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for certain, the CEO of Lullaby Trust, Francine Bates, said.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and homelessness.
Maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of items, such as children's clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the pack.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes divided by them meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, for his part, says that there is no security standard for the cardboard boxes.
Lullaby Trust says the packaging can be the best place to sleep if there is no frame or bedline available.
The organization recommends that packaging be used only for the day-to-day sleep and that it cease to be used at the point when the child can turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pet animals out of the packaging and ensuring that it does not soak or soak.
The vikelka frog escaped the Japanese zoo for a second time
The Japanese zoo personnel are looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and ran away in two weeks for a second time.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa’s zoo in Okaya, Japan, on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned that Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo, told us.
A runaway 35-year-old frog is female, 55-pound and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the frog shall be free to travel in the territory of the hive.
The zoo has not been shown to show signs of a turtle.
The last runaway of Konna happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I saw it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These stars will help your company avoid Uber errors
Amy Renett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her online shop start business, but the questionnaires did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the surveys were anonymous, some workers were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent and objective", says Erentt. His hair care company Madison Reed focuses on the online shop. The company has 75 employees.
Solet decided to resort to outside assistance.
More and more new types of personnel management start-ups have become available to the markets to help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure the commitment of workers; they can carry out surveys and target them to specific teams and groups of people, provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct communication over the top management to the government.
"My health can be monitored with applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit stay?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint-start in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytical software to measure employee engagement.
Erentt has spent three years using Glint's software, and he says he's got a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
In addition, it can produce a map of which you can see with one eye which departments are more dissatisfied and which leaders have received the weakest assessments.
The companies have understood that they must monitor the culture of the workplace so that they do not become Uber. The transport company has been upset since the former employee wrote in his blog about the culture in which workers are harassed and punished for their problems.
For start-ups such as Glint, such neglects are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are the global industry, the value of which, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, can rise to over USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
In Denver, the Convercent state of Colorado is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced a crash.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It has recently entered into an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to conduct customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, workers may report inconsistency by means of an anonymous text message.
And if you have reason to doubt the manager, the complaints will go directly to the company's government.
"The general opinion has been replaced by the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or operates in an unfair manner, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it may also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has used the Convercent for over a year, because it wants to ensure that workers are aware of the policies and procedures and have easy access to the headquarters.
The previous practice was that if the worker wanted to report the problem, he first had to find out his phone number or email address, which was able to make the notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday, Law Director James Vitrano. According to her, the complaints made by the workers were difficult to follow.
Previously, problems were hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with faster.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive view of the reality of the worker," says Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"In the same way, we protect our shareholders from the cases of employment relationships."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take a more serious attitude to ethics, values and employee commitment after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of the ethical activity in the context of Enron scandal.
Only with the social media did the companies realise that they could no longer prevent their dufficients from being publicised.
"The desire was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics", Quinlan says.
Glint and Converter offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by equity investors, both Glint and Convercent are supported by equity investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, a total of 47 million dollars.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total funding of USD 60 million.
Investment is not a surprise given the links between companies, enterprise culture and venture capital.
A number of studies show that workers expect more jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as pilaakson, good wages, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Workers want to feel accepted and appreciated and given their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Workers are more committed to the company's success if they enjoy the company and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding", says Nina McQueen, Director of the LinkedIn Company responsible for the remuneration and welfare of employees.
Investors get a profit when companies succeed, and companies succeed when workers commit.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they interest investors.
According to work culture experts, it is important to know about the commitment of workers;
but it will be useless if, on the basis of it, no action is taken.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if the change does not come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the employee's commitment.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to hold four thousand discussions", says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on collecting information.
"If the company fails to take action, the workers will start to wonder if they came to hear
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to the report, Madison Reed is currently carrying out monthly staff surveys and is able to deal with the problem on the same day as is stated in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated workers, Rerett was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that deeper understanding will help it improve staff permanence in the long term in the industry, which is known for the high turnover of workers.
"If the company is not committed to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees", says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing his naked wife, reports news office TT.
The woman in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she had noticed her window outside of the cell phone hanging around the rope’s head.
According to the woman, the cell camera shot her in the apartment.
A woman intimidating from the incident had run into another room to dress up.
Once the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after it was calculated in the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of smuggling has admitted that he's photographed a woman.
However, he claimed that he was only photographing her face.
The video on the phone had been deleted, and the police had not managed to return it to evidence.
In hearings, he has admitted a crime, but he has refused to commit a crime.
The man he filmed was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor, "I'm being crazy."
According to the News Office TT, a man will be charged with a case.
Teachers call for more ease in the autumn negotiations
The wage developments cannot be lower than the export industry, for example, but the difference should be narrowed down, said Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of the OAJ on Thursday.
The temporary operation of public holiday allowances highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the review would in no way involve the cut-offs made.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only arise once the private sector's documents are signed and the percentages of the increase are clear.
A number of predictions are that the working conditions of the OAJ have been agreed in January, for example.
You know, the percentage targets, the Luukkanen, haven't revealed yet.
It is also the president of the Public Training Advisory Organisation Jukko.
Number of persons: Home Money surgery increases earnings-related differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a deterioration in the purchasing power of public sector employees, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the figures, the fixed-term holiday cut will further deepen earnings-related differences.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher should be defined
Furthermore, the OAJ points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the best and least successful differences are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are declining, and differences between students and regions continue to grow.
Bruns's players' day was longer when the NSAA reduced their daily exercises between two.
It's almost 11:00 p.m., and a bunch of U.S. football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some of them have removed their playing shirts, and their backs are shiny after the first day of the training camp.
Time for many of them to have this chat class for a few minutes is a midday break.
After three hours of training, the players who attend summer courses at the University return to the dormitory to read the final exams. The next morning they will meet at the Wasserman football center at 6:30.
"There will be three days to come to these guys," says the coach Jim Mora of Bruins, shortly before the change of Monday to Tuesday.
The university roof organization reduced the number of daily training courses to two together, with the aim of reducing the number of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the last final exams will be held.
That is why the first three UCLA exercises started 15 minutes more than seven nights. It was difficult to find space for players already on full schedule.
This year, the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time Mora has continued through the Westwood coaching period, while the exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
The training is scheduled to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation starts for the opening match: UCLA will meet Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported the NCAA's rule change, even though it made the players' schedule even more stringent.
"We're going to put a lot of pressure on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But players are ready to work.
I think it'll get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside the camp. It is not easy to take into account the direct view of the parking area next to the training fields and Luskin Center, a flat-top hotel that has already been bombed over the protective net behind the paint pole with flying football.
Bruins players are due to change to the hotel during the coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The thing is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video. It's not exaggerated by concern.
The video described in the exercises pays quite a lot.
But we have guards there and the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother you with it.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
There will be presidential elections in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which is already being held clear.
Paul Kagame is officially pursuing its third period, but in practice he has had an impact on the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF ended the exhilarating genocide.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, for example, the distortion of poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to pursue its efforts because the Constitution, which was limited to two periods of presidency, was amended.
However, in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely respected leader.
In his time there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment has taken place in the country.
Kagame has also played a major role in combining the state of genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether the liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has promised his people more freedom after the earth has been set on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights false news by enhancing the verification of facts
Facebook intends to send potential false news to increasingly independent facts inspectors and to present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
On its website, the company published a statement that it will start using updated machine learning in the identification of false news. Any false news will be sent to the facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest counterfeit distributors, and many believe that false news affected the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has come to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded in false news before May and Germany preparing for the September elections supports the plan to sanction social media networks if they do not rapidly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook, in a separate opinion published in Germany, announced that a study of facts was carried out in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see what stories do not pass through the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more clearly what they read and share", Sara Su, Product Manager of Facebook News Feed, wrote in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing related articles and make other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Born in a series of books: The story of a castle
Little Scotney castle in Kent's Count is now known for Squeeze's music video as well as Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming castle in Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a comic book, written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired writer in old documents.
"It's great to get over 300 years ago to study the text written by a dead person," says Rhodes.
"I know a personal connection when I keep a letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian era. Each story has been pictured by different artists, promising British cartoon designer: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on the archives of Rhodes. In 2014, he appeared from Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration sources were British National Library documents. The project was emotional.
"I went into tears in a letter and I saw a thumbprint written by a double agent working for the Jacobies in the 17th century," says Rhodes.
"It was his print!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time the lights were used as lights.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel like he's on the spot himself.
I love archives!"
For almost four months, a writer who had spent time living in old documents was allowed to stay in prison with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which seemed too good to be true; he admits that he was not able to stay in prison without delay a little longer than he had hoped for.
He spent days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rares, such as the hyena heads hanged on the walls and the bottles that were held up for centuries.
He wandered around the ruins and farms of the old castle and discussed with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes also books with picturesque artists.
I'd say, "Take some whiskey and start writing."
The closer history of Scotney is rather unknown, since the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation's staff was only about to start the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held by the same method for hundreds of years: by taking everything extra to the fin.
In the archives there were journals, letters from the English Empire and maps of who owned anything. "It could be imagined that the mazes are boring," Rhodes says. "These families, however, fought for even one hard.
I was wondering if we'd let it be."
Some of the books go from castle to history, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man who soon after the castle was completed in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex says there was a riot in the castle in 1380", Rhodes says.
"The British peasant rebellion began in the same area, and it came to mind that rebellion can begin with riots.
Maybe these events are connected?
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, a priest hidden by Darrell’s family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smugler, once again, tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 17th century. He is said to stage his own funeral by filling the coffin with stone (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotland.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problems by marrying the wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome men, who were able to lighten up the heirs."
Now Rhodes is applying for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life Hill, a healing building in the beginning of the 20th century, which is left with only a euphoric plot.
The Castle of Scotney has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this evil ark yet."
You know, the worst in Russia, then the cold war.
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented on the Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship to Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Mr Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, in particular, since the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to operating in such a way that tensions do not become high.
As long as we are strong and predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid agitating the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, President of the United States Donald Trump was able to say that there was even a dangerous poor level between the US and Russia.
Trump urged to thank the countries for their poor avoid­ing Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitzko will stop the renegotiation against Anthony Joshua.
World champion Vladimir Klitzko stops his career.
Ukrainian Klitzko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Klitzko hit gold as a professional 69 times winning 64.
He held different MM labels in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitzko lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury found him at a point in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitzko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium, and after the wild match he lost in the 11th edition.
Joshua and Klitzko were expected to meet at a re-election match in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitzko found no motivation for the match.
I used purposely to make a few weeks' decision to get me sufficient distance to the Wembley match, Klitzko told me when he announced it.
I've accomplished everything I've dreamed of as an amateur and professional fighter, and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitzko’s reasoning for its decision on the video.
In the announcement, Mr Bernd Bönte, Klitzko’s manager, said that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitzko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitzko has been dating Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
Paris has one child, a daughter of Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitzko's great brother Vitali is also the former world champion of the heavyweight series.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the MMs of different alliances at the same time.
The Finnish weatherbreaker takes on the conditions: "Vie fiil"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer’s external railway season.
Minna Nikkas has had a problem with the circumstances.
Wind and cold have taken her from a girl's fiil.
Even in London's World Cup, there are unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen speaks the weather.
The circumstances have been against Minna Nikik this summer.
I don't want to blame the track, but I didn't even get to move the little things properly, Nikinen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been racing and practicing here in the road how many times I've never experienced a one-changing wind in this place, Nikinen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this season, standardizing the jump has been very difficult when the exercises have also had such unstable winds, Nikanen said in the Kaleva races.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
It's been quite a challenge to get the technology together, whether it's a cold drink or something.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away from the fiil.
It doesn't make sense to spend energy under a bad condition.
He got his gray jump 455 thanks to the World Cup.
It's been 445.
It's not the same for everyone in London.
There's got to be a bowl and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to cross 460 on Friday.
Why don't you change your practice abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer, I was from the early season in Italy and Germany.
I got my jump together and I got the technology standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing right now.
Normally, it's got the hall to practice, and now the hall's been closed.
How would it be better to race?
Twenty-five degrees warm.
There's a little wind going on, as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex- Official stunned politicians at Yle: "We have no room for division now and for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the Government of Juha Sipilä must keep the ice in the hat and ensure that the government budget is raised with debt, warn the Ministry of Finance of the budget of Erkki Virtanen who prepared for decades.
He says there's no room for sharing.
Yle interviewed the resident Virta in 2015 at the Nkkösamu in the middle of the week.
The construction of the budget of the state next year is just beginning.
Recent policy proposals have been addressed by politicians, including the raising of the guarantee pension, the calculation of the tax on cars and the support of electric bicycles, Virtanen considers it to be an election speech.
They are mainly saying that elections are beginning to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no room for division now or for many years.
I even think it's fraud to talk about sharing money when it comes to debt, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts owe to children.
Virtaste has a long experience in preparing the state's budgets: in 1978 she started at the Ministry of Finance as the secretary-general of the budget and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Head of Budgets.
Last time he retired, he was the head of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
During the interview, Virtanen pointed out that the projected growth rate of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a pit that is due next year to go down to the bottom line, and Finland is expecting an increase of 1% for tens of years.
Washington amends the permanent residence permit rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, strengthen temporary employment permits and limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process benefits applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have the skills to benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the media.
The wife of the queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaree described in April.
The Danish queen Margareeta, 77, and her spouse Prince Henrik, 83, is not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's House today announced that Prince Henrik did not want to be buried in the Roskilde Court, the court says when he announced on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, this is because the prince's dissatisfaction in his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his roles and titled in Danish monuments, the Head of Communications of the court, Lena Belleby, commented in the newspaper.
The prince’s decision not to bury him alongside the queen is a natural consequence that he is not treated equally with his mate.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the desire of her spouse's burial site and understand the decision.
A terrible time on the road: the car was on the motorway to get on the top of the road
Tom had a partner in his car and two little kids.
They are not injured in an accident, but they do not receive money from the insurance unless the other party is sought.
The damage occurred with Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo of the construction site of Kehä III.
Vantalainen Tommi tells us that her family survived a miracle on Tuesday in a car accident.
Tommi, the two small children of his open-air group Riina and the couple drove on the motorway with Keimolanport in the direction of Vantaa Hämeenlinna.
The ring III connected to the Hämeenlinna Way was driven by a white car that was driving to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
If it wasn't for an ambush, the car would have been on top of Tom.
I brake and turned the car at the same time, and it left my hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit the rail with high speed.
The parents and two small children on the back seat were not injured.
Another child is a little less than 3 years old, one less less than a year old.
I guess it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No passing passer was even driving towards us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident happened around 17.20 p.m.
According to Tom, no one stopped by, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car with their own power.
The staff of the ambulance and rescue department came in, and the family's condition was checked.
The car went to the redemption.
Tommi tells him and his partner have little income, and they got help buying a car a few years ago.
Without the other car's information, the family says Tom doesn't get the money from the insurance.
That is why the family hopes to be seen by the witnesses about the car that the family drove to the rail.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was white, old-fashioned.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If we don't get caught, I don't know how we manage financially, we're gonna have to count every cent now.
Tommi hopes that it's seen or something that knows about it is connected to the police.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Agency confirm that they have had an accident on Tuesday night.
The headline and the case were corrected at 9:15 p.m. Unlike what was originally said in the case, the other car, according to Tommi, did not come to the receiving lane, but was to drive from the acceleration strip to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with human relationships by the means of humor - the self-responsor will be seen at What? on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who comes from Kouvola, will bring her pre-school guide to What? Theatre.
The self-defencer is a music theatre performance about past relationships and insufficientness.
According to Director Lotta Jäppinen, it's still a good idea.
The topic is dealt with by means of humor.
You don't get to spend time feeling old, she says.
The rounding summer theatre performance, according to Jäppinen, is carried out with a long-range budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance is challenging to consider what a person reveals about himself when he gets to know a new person.
Maybe he's pulling some kind of role, or he's approaching another coat?
Uncomplicated presentation confuses the fact and fiction
The giant has both guided and dramatized the show.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The presentation is made up of the working group’s texts and does not have a plot.
The director believes that even though the presentation is exhaustive about the thinking of young people, it speaks of all ages.
He stresses that the self-sufficient does not tell us directly about his or his personal relationships with the working group.
Fact and fiction mix.
Well, I'm sure my world of values will be a part of the show.
I do not think that human relationships would be bad, but also that human relations, especially relationships, would be a lucky condition.
Many learn from their divorced parents
He believes that the self-responsor draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
Many have learned much from their parents, many of whom have been divorced.
At least it's that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The exhibition presents Mina Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes Ms. Ella Snellman.
The music is made by Jäppinen and Roka.
Love for the theatre was born in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is a director of theatre expression at the University of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's been two years behind the back, two years in front of the other one.
The intense enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The music classes have been an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and have played at the University Theatre in Helsinki and the last time in Linna Theatre in Turku.
I've become more and more interested in guidance.
The self-disaster received his first night in Helsinki last week at Narr's stage.
In the future, a presentation lasting about 45 minutes has also been seen, at least in the University of Jäppinen, Turku.
Self-repairing Kouvolan What? In the theatre at 8pm and 5 p.m. at 14 and 19pm.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a rough motocrossnetnet - the necklace broke
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstopped natural force as Janne Lahtela.
A year ago, the Kupares Ace traveled the world for hundreds of days, for twenty years, chasing its dream of an Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela's movement continued.
He was not only a tired intern, but a pilot of new species.
Many forms of exercise on earth may not have been tested at least once by a man from Lake Kemi.
It's been a pleasure to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela tells you.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela suffered a motorcross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands broke.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds at home for a year, says Lahtela.
It was bad luck at the bay.
He also admits that age could have been a part of the ruin.
You know, driving a girlfriend, it sounds like a lot of fun.
But I didn't pick up the limits on it.
It is only as a species so hard that it is not too much for such a 40 - year - old person to exercise!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a very special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
The behind was a long rush to the Japanese freestyle team as head coach.
Lahtela started washing up immediately after the completion of her own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, so Lahtela will tell me.
Even during the training period, Lahtela often protected his breasts and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my thoughts did not seem reasonable.
Not even about the species.
It was good to be in place.
I actually enjoy it because I actually got to be.
The compulsory break inspired Lahtela to become the main coach of Finland.
Without stopping, she's afraid she'd be burned out.
It's easier to find places that have been cut off than jewelry!
If it wasn't for an accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as coach of the Finnish freestylemaa team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place for high-speed species.
I switched the motocrosses to frisbeegolfi!
I mean, it just went off right away.
At most, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-intelligent trainer, he does not require his training staff to be the same as him.
I'm not gonna make all of them in the same fashion.
In our culture, there is room to be your own kind and ways to be the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been consistent with it, says Lahtela.
The sex robots are coming and we have to be worried.
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry – just as it had begun to feel that 2017 could no longer become more strange.
Yes, I do.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
"We must begin to take seriously the generalisation of sex robots," says the founding member of the Foundation and professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Noel Sharpy Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"The sex robots are sweaty, but they're already sold quite a lot, and we'll see more of them," Sharkey said at the public conference.
Sexweeds have developed into breathtaking dolls with warm-looking silicone skin and artificial intelligence creatures that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adjust the robot’s preferences from the eye to the shape of the nipples and to the type and color of the fingernails.
What is even more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sexguds have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the preferences of the user, whether shy or shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventure-like and so on.
"Roxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality", the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It could be kind of tired, talking, or "in the wind".
There are a number of worrying features in the generalization of sex robots, replacing genuine relationships with human beings, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct forms of rape when the user approaches, for example, a robot that has been programmed as shy and resistance.
True Companion compares Roxxy robot with vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new sex game.
Their generalisation and development are about something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is an alternative among others.
Of course, most men do not get sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report told us about their growing popularity.
However, Marginal phenomena tell a great deal about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only when the market permits it.
It is no accident that sex robots have begun to become more common at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and the President is sitting in the White House, who has been bragging about women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjatáresi) is not the most worrying of its powerful image language, for example pictures of the body hanging out and the eyes dug out. The most alarming is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprising short trip.
Sex robots are designed to make as much sex robots as technically possible, such as real women (porno-star proportions).
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and movements imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — no evidence of independence or a complete subjugation of fantasy.
They are pleasant servants.
The slave.
Police suspect: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by Chief Isis
The head of the company Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of carrying a bomb to the Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person belonging to the Isis leadership had also sent Sydney the building parts of the bomb.
Suspects say that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell you more about why the company got interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-colored gas-dissolved device and to take the device to a public location, for example, in a public transport vehicle.
Deputy Secretary Michael Phelan of the Federal Republic of Australia says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
Trump's good side?
Make Mitt Romney look like the heir to a healthy mind
During Trump's period, it has already been repeated to get bored that a powerful chauffeur of voters has also broken up families at everyday level.
On the road to Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspapers provided guidance on how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to break up our information file.
The less attention has been given to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, a poet of a left spirit in Chicago, who's long gone against our family of Republicans.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a powerful uniting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins are all familiar – including a sister who is in favour of Republicans, with whom he has challenged politics for decades – are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but in a broader sense it is accompanied by significant risks.
Trump has given the left new power, but the distorting influence of his Presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the scary opportunity that one day we won't be able to scare his tricks any more.
In the long term, the possibility that Trump normalizes the Republicans of the right extreme, which, as far as Trump is concerned, all of a sudden seem quite reasonable.
I look back on Mitt Romney's slow version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and at least we have seen his tax returns).
When Trump's season is over, the Republicans' next presidential candidate needs to be clear, and it seems like a considerable improvement right away.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to Central Park Carousel, which is the biggest carousel in New York Park Department and the best they can get in New York with three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of Karusell are huge, in the middle of the characters — the gloomy clowns and the animals that look back to the horror — and the underlying fierce music is strangely fascinating.
Many of the characteristics of New York City become disappointing over time: the prospects of high buildings start to get bored, the city silhouette becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city does not correspond to dreams.
And still, after 35 years, it has come all over that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large transport circle in northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is, however, a Swiss-loving pub, but it is not counted.
The carousel of the Central Park, however, is still a strange magical experience — even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-olds and two 40-year-old women enjoy it enormously.
I would've given the bear a full score if someone had asked for my evaluation, but, fortunately, no one came here to ask me questions.
Instead, I was asked this week in the department store to assess my "paying experience" on a scale of one of the five stars before I put my credit card on the reading device.
The same thing about my coffee shop in my neighbourhood, but it also gives me the opportunity to combine 15% of the service allowance with an estimate when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows the everyday interaction and pressures the customer to put his person into the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The salesman of the yard smiled at me as I was feeling tired of giving my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inters, "I had no trust in the leadership."
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq's company's representation team coach's duties.
The coaching responsibility to take Fabrizio Piccareta, a former assistant coach.
The rest of the training team will continue in its current tasks.
Italy’s Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in subland, for example.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta joined the Interin training group has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Government of FC Inter, is sorry for what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the management of the Society, when there was no alternative now, Håkans commented in the Society’s release.
The Piccareta agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He and the other training team are already responsible for the HIFK in their home match tomorrow.
According to the evening reports, the team has been running down Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that I'm following Piccare and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta got together strongly at the Interi match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a photo of youth from the '80s, would you identify a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, a violin artist, published a photo on Instagram.
There are several strings added to the picture, which allow you to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders the young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he'll communicate.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published images of his past, and has also spoken about the bitter subjects.
A fair year ago, he published a photo pair of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, he will be seen 20 years ago, the second he will pose now as the mother of two children.
In his image, Lampenius discusses his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered when he was younger.
20 years ago, and today...
I still look like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to English hashtags life, eating disorder, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-esteem, love himself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
He was already 14 years old at the hospital for anorexia and orthorxia.
A little later, he also got sick of his bulimia, which was eventually discovered only in 2006.
The healing started with a little bit of silence.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year he received hospital care for the cuts in his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he got when he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following the original murder conviction of the prosecutors.
He killed Stenkamp's Valentine's Day in early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night-to-night intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to appeal again because they consider the judgment of Pistorius six years too mild.
The Prosecutor intends to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the complaint may already be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may extend to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the bTV channel.
The police arrested a bunch of unauthorized encamped people in Sithon on the morning of August 1, which included two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the case will continue.
According to TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that they had released Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping areas and are already giving significant fines to all who camp in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
The inspections shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry stated that the court may impose a fine.

Red meat, milk products and chocolate may relieve irritant bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a fresh study suggests the opposite: a diet containing a high level of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritant bowel syndrome.
An incursed bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that has around 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Great Britain. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or blood diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
In general, those suffering from adult bowel syndrome are advised to avoid meat and milk products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid cryptophan contained in protein helps the body develop immune cells that enhance the ability of the gut to tolerate it.
According to the director of the study, Marco Coonna, immune cells protect the bowels and ensure that the harmful microbes in food do not escape the body.
The cells that cause infections are balanced by cells that enhance tolerance, which protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, it may result in irritant bowel syndrome.
Studies have shown that there are immune cells that enhance tolerance in mice with certain bacteria in the intestinal tract.
This bacteria needs tryptophan to produce immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building ingredients of proteins.
"We found contact between the development of Lactobacillus reuter and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the intestinal normal microbiome", Professor Colonna says.
"The more mice' diet was cryptophane, the more they had these immune cells."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuter bacteria and a diet containing high levels of tryptophan may enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
When investigating immunocells to enhance tolerance, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that while one mouse group had such cells, they were not in the same mouse species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbions of mice, i.e. the gastrointestinal normal association of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was studied, six species of bacteria were detected in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter bacteria were administered to mice growing in a sterile environment without intestinal microbions and without immune cells, immune cells began to develop.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affected the immune system and they raised Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in liquid and transferred small amounts of fluids — without bacteria — from mice to immature immune cells.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-enhanced cells.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptofane metabolism known as indol-3-mal acid.
When researchers doubled the number of cryptophan in mice, the number of cells strengthening tolerance increased by about 50 %. When cryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Cervantes-Barragan says that man has the same tolerance cells as mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether cryptophane by-products from Lactobacillus reuter bacteria develop cells in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with acute intestinal syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells, because they regulate inflammation in the inner surfaces of the intestines", says Cervantes-Barragan.
"A high level of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got into its ranks after he made a deal with Neman and Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got into its ranks after a deal with Nemanja Matic. Midfield player debyted Manchester United in the fight against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
In the last round of the UEFA Super Cup tournament in Dublin, which moved from Chelsea to 40 million pounds, Matic started a 2-1 victory before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He was impressed by a defensive middle field player against stars such as Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not yet in the best condition because he was not involved in the Asian tour before the start of the season. He was only able on the field for 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, there must be a change before the beginning of the selective era.
"He needs time, but his experiences, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We're going to help him get ready rather than be ready later."
Besides Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to slice his opening session for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a great job by acquiring three of his four priority players.
"three out of four – it must be given thanks to the company," he added.
"I'll be more pleased if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."

When we played patiently and aggressively in certain places, we were able to work with them, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland had collected 14 points in Pia Korhonen.
Three of the four lost Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: A large jury has already sent challenges to the Trump Jr Russia meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A large jury called Robert Mueller's team has already sent out challenges in connection with the meeting of the Russian lawyer known as Donald Trump Jr. and the Kremlin contact link with Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The news office Reuters, which, at the same time, confirms the invitation of the grand jury previously revealed by Wall Street Journal on Thursday.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of the Veselnitskaya, known as Trump Jr and the Kremlin links, held in the middle of the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's campaign manager Paul Manafort and his current son-in-law Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means that the pace of Russian investigation is condensing.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to assist in an investigation that seeks to resolve Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his neighbourhood was working with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, sends challenges and forces people to witness with a whale.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
A large jury weighs the evidence that the prosecutor is investigating and decides whether the case should be prosecuted.
The British invented microchip to get home and to his car with a hand swing.
In the first place, British explorer has been microchiping himself in the whole country so that he can open his home door, get into his office and start his car with a swing.
The microchip is between the 33-year-old Steven Northam thumb and the front finger. Now he offers services to companies and individuals who want to facilitate their lives with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, a hospital consultant at the Royal Hampshire Count's Hospital in Winchester, Hantsi, in order to meet the medical requirements of the microchip.
Microchip uses the same technology as microchips in cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install it.
Northam's company also converts the locks of houses and cars into compatible with the microchip. One lock handling costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and she has one child. She has installed microchip technology both in her home and in her BMW Z4 car, which starts when she drops her hand on the steering wheel.
Your White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last decision of the White House to fly a naval helicopter to the southern lawn in the White House to show American production had to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on his ride. It was a petition at the event held in the White House on 17 July 2017 in which American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were familiar with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailing boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The White House Military Bureau had requested the helicopter to arrive only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern lawn into the "extraordinary" event. This is reflected in the documentation of the Navy HMX-1 helicoptership.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this, because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," said HMX-1 Unit Commander on the day before the event, in an e-mail message to his superior, Deputy Commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn at the 17th of July and that the event would start at 3 o'clock in the morning. Helicopter would leave the place only after the field of grass would be empty between 6 and 9.
In addition, it noted that if a helicopter had been delayed from the White House, another crew would be needed due to limitations in service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documentation received by the TIME magazine does not indicate whether a second crew was eventually required.
The US Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 was asking if there was any violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was the Hatch Act that was broken, and we were told not to be broken," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commander answered.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At that time, the president spoke in favour of the reform of healthcare on the Senate, as well as the more open national regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their journey,
but their use is unusual for photographs only.
Trump’s actions were advocating attention in February when Air Force One rolled behind the President’s campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised his predecessor for using presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products from all 50 states produced by American workers," said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
HMX-1 unit crews conduct regular training flights in the Washington area and practice in the southern grass field the introduction of the President to the White House with a centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 requests for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
That day, helicopters of the unit also flown 11 hours to "non-responsible support tasks".
According to the White House, the event did not involve any other cost for taxpayers.
The informant of Sikorsky reported that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have any accounts of flights related to the duties of the President, and the precise assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
According to the Finnish Ministry of Defence 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter’s compensation rate is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to the HMX-1 Unit documentation, flights from Quantico base to the State of Virginia to the White House and back lasted an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"The calculation of costs to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading", says Walters.
"The planned level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called sunken costs, which will be taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a report by the RAND research company in 2015, the level of compensation does not include staff costs but takes into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter’s use in the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thereby employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard on.
It is entirely appropriate to bring this forward."
It's not sure if Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he hit the truck driver.
In the White House, Trump made a joke to the press about his own Sikorsky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."

Venezuelan state prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative
The State Prosecutor in Venezuela has applied for a court order to prevent the appointment of a new representative.
The Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the representative committee elected in the vote last Sunday is due to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a representative committee was elected to the country, which could, among other things, change the constitution of the country.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the order of refusal has been requested for election toilets.
Ortega has also started a election poll.
He appointed two judges after the British representative voting said that the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
There were only allies in Maduro, and there are among other things the son and wife of Maduro in the 545 elected representative council.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the council may break down the Congress led by the opposition and amend the laws.
Maduroa described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the drafting of the Constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called this dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have, for their part, declared that they do not recognise the new representativeship.
Maduro claims that the new council is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
There's a lot of people down there, and more than 100 people are dead.
Venezuela fell into the financial crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medication.
The opposition is also expected to show its views on Friday, when the new representative body is to start.
Russian man given up by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced the 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years imprisonment for participation in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the US demand.
According to the Russian magazine Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, reports AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had received millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the execution of the sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly accused Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be given up to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had been using a computer virus called Ebury that had taken tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish usernames and passwords.
After that, they used information by still guiding Internet traffic, which was used to make cliches and distribute spam.
For example, according to Chief Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt other cyber criminals.
We have the ability to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco explained in the press.

Kari Kola implements an extraordinary art of light to Paris
In order to celebrate the first day of light set by the United Nations in Paris next May, the light artist Kari Kola will perform an exceptional light art.
Kola is doing a photo art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of this work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
In the book, the Fontenoy building and its Globe monument are illuminated by Unesco headquarters.
In addition to the light, I want to highlight the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make things concretely visible to you, says the photo artist, Kari Kola, about her work.
I am well taken from the invitation to participate in the first international light day and bring light to the art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening ceremony of the Valo Year in 2015, when she was lighting the celebration of Unesco headquarters.
I feel very privileged when I get my skills back to Unesco headquarters, Kari Kola tells me.
The work may still expand significantly.
This is what we will inform you about later in the autumn, Kola will continue.
The aim of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of humanity and raise people's awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first light day is celebrated at the Unesco headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fighting in the parking garage in Espoo
Two men had been challenged in Espoo at the Iso Omena parking hall on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute began when another party accidentally drove into a forbidden driving direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
The forbidden driver hit the driver in the second car, and as a result, this car started running into the driver’s car.
After this, he hit another bump in the hood.
In the preliminary speech, the man has admitted that he has caused injury and that he has done wrong.
Timo Soin asked the question mark: "After that there became a flood"
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Timo Soini (v.) published a blog writing entitled "Quarter".
The article is short, only two sentences.
In my day, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven representatives of government.
Then came the flood, now all the bells, Soni writes.
The text of Soin contains references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludvig XV or his lover Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the water injection comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, history books have left the words "the flood after us" or "the flood after me".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the Head of the UN delegation to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The interim director of the UN grant mission, Nicholas Haysom, stated that hundreds of women are held in elections, three women are seeking vice-presidents, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be over-emphasized", Haysom said in his opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The elections of the Government of Afghanistan and the presidential elections will be held on 5 April17.
The Taliban has presented threats to elections at the same time as international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power shifts from peacefully democraticly elected government to one another.
Mr Haysom said that the contribution of women to democracy in Afghanistan was strengthened.
According to the Afghan independent electoral committee, 1,2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
Friday is rainy and windy
Friday will bring a lot of rain to the south.
In the capital region, the weather is rainy and quite windy.
In the afternoon, the cloud is smuggled and can develop thunderstorms.
Tonight's a clearer and more poetic.
There are many rains in the southern and central part of the country, and there can also be thunder in the south.
There'll be lunches in the south tonight, and there'll be more clarity, but there'll be some rain blow.
The afternoon temperature in the rain is about fifteen degrees since the end of a more uniform rain on the south coast.
In the north, cloud varies and comes local afternoon moons.
During Fridays and Saturdays low pressure controls the weather in the south and middle of the country, and rains are common.
In the north, the rains are low.
On Saturday, in the south and middle of the country, there are hundreds of places, including thunders.
The rains also cover part of Kainu.
In the north, clouds are rich this afternoon and will be isolated rain cubes.
On the south coast wind from lunch, in the middle and north of the country the air flow is on the east side.
On the north side of the British islands, there is a strong low pressure associated with the weather that brings heavy rains to the south of Fennoscan.
In Western and central Europe there is a western airflow and some deaf people become.
In southern Europe, the weather is sunny and hot and the temperature rises above 40 degrees.
There are thunders in the eastern part of the Mediterranean.
The flood of certain tourists is a threat to the culture of the region.
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local rage is particularly focused on the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it the " true and free" tourism: there are only a few hours in the target and there are only a few hours running through the big crowds.
Venetian is suffocating fast day trips to the city’s tourists.
It is difficult to move on narrow streets, and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre while hotels have become in place.
The New York Times and The Guardian are writing on the problems caused by tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist quantities.
They call the current phenomenon a poor tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the guide to the Piazzale Romama Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Tower, and you turn back to the Italian Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini, describes the current and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of place, shops and workshops.
We need to preserve this part of the city's identity.
The story of St. Mark also belongs to the most popular visitors of the Venice historical centre.
The Church of St. Marks is located on the border of the tower.
Also, local anger is mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic center of Venice.
In 1951 there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2 000 Venetian people expressed their opinion against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 inhabitants leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years' time there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was in the organization of the protest.
The equation is difficult because ships are bringing Venice what is desperately needed and creating a need for a large number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, a solution has been envisaged to allow cruisers to move further away from the historical centre.
Luciano Borto, who lives in Venice, would certainly change the situation if the administrative area of Veneto, where Venice is located, had more power to decide on its own matters - unless full autonomy.
In Venice, around 20-30 million tourists visit each year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Bad congestion on the motorway
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siiljärve to the north, there have been congestion of kilometres from Thursday afternoon work during return traffic.
The area is covered by motorway work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50 km speed limit for knowledge instead of a 120 km speed.
However, even within the 50 km restricted area, traffic had moved on to Thursday afternoons, practically on foot.
On Thursday afternoon, the road works went on the side of Lake Sililin in the case of the statue of Revelation, or gold.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published great images of himself in the Grand Canyon landscape, among others.
In his current country, Amalie Iuel, Denmark, has become a popular athlete in Norway, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in March on the 400-metre run by orbiting 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre-metre-long joy drink at the time of Norway's record 55.38.
After his record, Iuel, who used the social media, soon became aware that fame and publicity had a side to his side.
Men around the world began to send to Iuel pictures of their sex organs in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snachat account from outside.
I got a lot of "breaks" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private, Iuel told the VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to accurately identify the pictures he received.
I'm sure you can guess, Iuel was laughing.
It's nice to have feedback after running, but I'm going to be fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, father of Danish-Norway.
Iuel's family moved to Norway while Amalien was two years old.
When Amalien was 12 years old, her family first moved to Namibia because of her father's work, then to Pakistan.
After that, there were Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, which returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is training with the guidance of three trainers, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussing than in the United States.
Coaches in the United States don't ask anything, they only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway's record at 400 metres and 400 metres.
The foot injury took the snowboarder Janne Korve to the balance of the entire career... now included in the World Cup: "It's nice not to get hurt."
It's been nice counting since it didn't hurt!
Janne Korpi, 31 of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has come to enjoy his loving species again this season.
Last summer, the career continued at stake.
The stress of the foot table had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the foot did not want to improve at all.
The hand had taken a hit in the race story, too.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was gonna do. Whether the ferry continues or not.
The sponsors were gone, and a lot of things were open, so Korpi tells me.
But that's what they say, it's like things work out.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started to pull back into the chest.
After that, the conclusion was easy.
I knew it no later than when I was in the first snow.
I was so goddamned, yes, this is so funny again, we're gonna pull it over a couple more times.
The Korpi was able to count properly only in September to October, but after a long fall, only painless training has been a big deal.
There's only a few of the races around Korpi.
It doesn't matter.
Competitions have never been the main aspect of the table for Korvelle.
I've never fallen for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim at a one-on-one race for four years, and then you're hot for that week.
I can't think like that, says Korpi.
Today Korpi will race in the cheap spot of the MMs held in Sierra Nevada by Spain.
Even though individual races do not like him on board, he is always on fire with hard company.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the international skiing union has grown over the past few years, although some of the beginners chose Norway’s X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
However, I always feel that appreciation depends on the circumstances and the level of competitions.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The traps of the team, the 17-year-old Rene Rinne and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are Korpea 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow up on your younger friends.
I remember when it was at the same time that everything was new and so sickly excited about everything.
That's a new flow for itself, too. Korpi's thinking.
When I'm in the chest, I'm still after him, but by the way, I don't have that much power in my friends!
In the background of a board career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The guidelegend Pekka Korve's son is obsessed with nutrition sports: the plate has its own food horses for whom he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, there's no time to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at least the results of the diet, and usually something from the beginning, Korpi tells.
The treatment guidance and preparation are, according to Korve, a potential career plan when a plate career is completed.
I don't think I'm planning this far, but at least it's a likely option.
I'm just trying to make it look like I'm studying it in addition to this snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the nerves and develop, maybe in the summer, I'm just trying to get out of here.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when it's already done inside the species.
The medical cases include the carrier Jaajo Linnonmaa’s Elitloppet therapy.
The twins have rented a cruise ship that will head for the Stockholm Elitloppet restaurant at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has become a very big deal, and people have been excited about it.
We're already at the point that there won't be any bankruptcy.
A few months are still in place, hoping to get the ship full, Korpi says he's excited.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kite has surprised everything.
Attendo Ester is the name of a new nursing home for the 41-placed elderly who is built on Kite.
The building of over 1,700 - foot [1,700 - foot] will be completed next summer on the other side of the neighbor’s health centre.
The topic of general wonder is where the new care unit is sufficient for customers, as many private care homes are now running out of customer satisfaction during Siu’s wars.
Anne Flint Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for options but also for enhanced housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Mr Flint says.
Last year Attendo bought private nursing homes from Kite, Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The transaction concerned business, but the real estate is known to be a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo has no acute need to move operations away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand Scotland factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's Kessin Manufacturer's leaders of the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish department of the UK General Trade Union, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
The factory manufacturing Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products has more than 500 employees.
The company that owns the McVitie's brand, Pladis, reported that it invested more than 5 million pounds in the factory in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives will be "traced for the first time" if there are changes coming into play.
In its letter to the Executive Director, the GMB urges the company to "refill the concerns that no funding has been provided for the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union considers it extremely worrying that the factory manager does not have clear information on the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"The partners have been working here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly focused on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is an important employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income, as well as Brexit, rising living costs and continuous reduction of production, the Eastern Glasgow needs successful McVitie's production.
According to the press editor, the factory manager had received a letter from the union only on the previous day and the company is directly responsible for the letter because it appreciates continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and uncertain market companies, we constantly evaluate all our business activities and outlets in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the media, the company has invested over £5 million in Tollcross's factory in recent years, especially in its production lines and improvement of operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production facility and will certainly be the first to inform workers and trade union representatives if we are going to make changes to the factory's activities."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about the Neymar transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrati
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the target of Neymar after paying a transfer sum of £ 189 million for the termination of the contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
Sensation-like transfer is the most spoken summer case. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transplants. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a sum of GBP 89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive football player and also the world's most hired professional athlete, as PSG provides him with over 500 000 pounds of weekly salary after tax.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the operation of PSG and the way in which Neymar has left the club with its forces. The source near Barcelona tells us that the Society has kept very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they want our players, we'll be their opponents and contact their players," Al-Khelafi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they want our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have committed itself here precisely: it expressed its interest in the PSG middle field player Marco was previously compared this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow Italians to leave under any circumstances. It might well be that Barcelona would lose its star player, Neymar.
Liquid brake the rise of the stock exchange - Stock news - Night-Sanomat

NYT: The calls that Trump made were invented by the White House editor, "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls from US President Donald Trump never took place, says the New York Times.
The calls that Trump smoked with both the Mexican President and the leader of the Boy Scouts' organization have proved to be invent.
The White House journalist Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, had discussed with Trump at the G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty tough charge.
Those discussions happened, not just on the phone, but on the face, Sanders justified.
A talk to the Boy Scouts was a pain in the ass.
On Monday, Trump told the Mexican president that he had called him and congratulated Trump for the successful illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that few more will come across the South Mexican border because they know that the trip will, in any case, move to the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government published a release saying that no call had been made.
Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump gave his speech at a large meeting of the National Coastal Organisation in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the Boy Scouts, and he said it was the coolest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, a Boy Scout's organization informed me that it was not aware of any of its leaders' calls to Trump.
According to the press, the previous statement by the leader of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, who had asked Trump to apologize to the Boy Scouts, speaks his side.
Trump's speech at the Boy Scouts' Assembly raised a lot of confusion, as it was an exceptional political nature of the event.
Among other things, he gave rise to the results of the presidential elections last autumn.
