The people of Wales are afraid they'll look stupid.
Some members of the parliament have been confused by the proposal that their title should be replaced by an MWP, i.e. a Member of the Wales Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
He started with a plan to turn the name of the council into the Wales Parliament.
The members of the representative board are concerned, irrespective of their party status, that they may be mocked by the change.
According to one of the Labour Party representatives, the group is concerned about the fact that the name "sorry words with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to one Plaid Party representative, the majority of the group 'no satisfaction' and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the conservative party, his group views the name change as "open mind", but points out that the "MWP" word is a short figure of a stupid word.
In this context, the W-book in Wales is spoken in a similar manner to the U-book in Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is preparing the necessary legislative changes to the name, said: "The final decision on the appointments of members of the panel is of course a matter for members."
The law on the management of Wales for 2017 authorises the Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion on the proposals, stating that the appointment of a representative body as Parliament of Wales will enjoy broad support.
The Commission favours Members of the Wales Parliament as their title or abbreviated WMP, but the MWP option was most supported by a public opinion poll.
Members of the representative board are apparently proposing alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may lead to major changes to President Elin Jones, who is expected to have a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the activities of the representative board, such as the rules on the removal of the representative board and the form of a comitology system.
In the course of the examination of legislation, the members of the Assembly may make their final vote on the title of which they should be invited.
The Macedonians go to the electoral elections in the referendum on the amendment of the name of the country.
Sunday voters will vote on whether the country's name will be converted into the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum aims to resolve the conflict with Greece, which has been called its own country of Macedonia for decades.
Athens has long said that the name of the northern neighbour is practically a regional requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
The President of Macedonia against the referendum, Mr Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of referendums such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that change of name is simply the price paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' watches keep quiet when the Harlem churches live in difficult times
"The older people I've been talking to say that before every corner of the street there was a bar or a church," says Adams.
"We don't have either one now."
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said, "The interaction of men has changed."
"The bars are no longer common living rooms for people to meet regularly."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property is not as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the departure box."
He added that the churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not supported by the saints left behind in the neighborhood.
"The most people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white people," he says, "and therefore they will be forced to the day when these churches will shut down their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these rooms would become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black region - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired a building for its possession.
St. Martins took over the black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against 125th Street traders in Harlem's main shop.
In 1939 the fire was badly damaged by the building, and when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned reconstruction, they introduced a tower clock.
Pastor David Johnson, father of Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock clock.
The expert who called the tower clock game in July called it the second name "cultural heritage" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first black musician to play a tower watch game. It was a Dionio A. Lind, who changed to play a bigger tortoise game 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins, there has been a complex vyyyre in recent months, which will be accompanied by architects and contractors employed by the church’s painters and the Episcopal skis.
In July, the Governing Body, composed of the church’s painters, wrote to the stripman their concerns that the stripe would “saw the costs” on the sawmill, even though it had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who sent the strip.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency in the tidal system.
The shark damaged a 13-year-old lobster player in California.
The authorities tell me that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him while the boy dived into lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack occurred at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before seven in the morning.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had dived with his friends on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel first told me that the boy was only excited to ask the lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
When we got to the boy Hammel says he noticed that this whole skull had been torn open.
"I told everyone to leave the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
At the media conference, my lifeguard captain Larry Giles said that a few weeks earlier a shark had been detected in the area, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added serious injuries to the victim's upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablad Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that more than 135 sharks are present in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty care industry
Sainsbury's interviewing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in beautiful beauty care departments where they serve expert advisors.
This is an important movement for the UK’s GBP 2.8 billion beauty care industry, which continues to grow, although sales of fashion and household goods are declining. Greater beauty care departments are tested in 11 stores across the country and are successfully extended to other stores next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's tells its beauty range of 3,000 products that double the product, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and they receive their own brand-specific range of Boots stores.
Supermarket also launches its Boutique makeup selection again. In the future, the majority of products will be Vegan friendly because young shoppers increasingly require it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop has tried rental houses in two Sainsbury's stores. Last week the first was opened in Croydon, South London, and the other one is opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and food purchases to small one-time purchases in nearby shops force supermarkets to come up with new incentives for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that shoppers will look even more from stores when a supermarket chain is struggling against cheap shops such as Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After purchasing both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened up hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habitat stores.
Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacies.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boots at the beginning of the 21st century, but the cooperation ended with regard to the distribution of income from supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's 281 stores to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy chain, with a total of 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company told Lloyds that it was part of the plan to expand the four shops by markings such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, the range of luxurious skin care products.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and mood of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in special training workers who are willing to advise customers.
Our selection responds to all our needs and attractive environments as well as our convenient locations make us a convincing place to buy beauty care that challenges the traditional way to shop."
Peter Jones "in his arms" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the 11 million-dollar contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "in his arms" when TV driver Holly Willoughby withdrew from 11 million pounds of contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home articles and costumes for Truly.
Two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop.
The 37-year-old drunkard on this morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was driving Dragons Den star Peter Jones away from their profitable lifestyle business at the last minute, and now he's going to focus on his new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell us that Jones was in his "rails" last Tuesday at a tight-ass meeting held at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new 1.5 million-dollar contract would not leave enough time for their home gift and apartment brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop, and it was taken over by double Willoughby’s estimated assets of £11 million.
On Instagram, 37-year-old Willoughby left Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his survival for the next two decades.
His starting decision has left all the surprise to come.
No one was so close to the release of Tuesday's events.
The main office of Marlow has a warehouse full of products waiting for sale".
This morning is one of the United Kingdom’s most secure stars, and according to experts his departure may cause millions of losses to the company due to product placements, which include all pillows and clothing for household goods, not to mention delays in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Cap.
Willoughby organized Capp Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones moved to chair in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% share of Baldwin TV production.
Willoughby will be baked from M&S's new brand transmitter and replaced by Ant McPartlin's ITV I'm A Celebrity program.
The source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
I mean, it's hard to talk, and then we fell in love.
He was joking about the criticism that he would get in the media about his comments, which some would consider to be inappropriate for the President, as well as his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be a new anchor.
"I didn't give up any."
He pointed out that Kim was interested to meet again after Trump had taken a significant step forward in the first meeting of July towards North Korea's nuclear crisis.
However, the nuclear negotiations have broken down.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North Pole did not see a "corresponding reaction" from the United States for the early armed repression of North Korea.
On the other hand, he said that the United States would continue its sanctions, which are intended to keep pressure on.
Trump had a much more optimistic vision in his speech.
"He's doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were running into a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results.
He also defended his unusual style of speaking about his relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to reach 10,000 more outside, we have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, showing the audience right ahead.
Indonesia's tsunami and shock destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, a number of volunteer organisations from abroad were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency facilities required by international aid were not declared, although about 10% of the people in Lombo had remained homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form the Paluu traveling group, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the informant of the National Disaster Agency, said to the Indonesian authorities to assess the situation, please see whether international organisations are allowed to participate in aid work.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared to meet natural forces, taking into account repeated earthquakes on a regular basis.
Although the tsunamis have been built in Acehi, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The request was likely lost because of the missing tsunami warning route, even though the warning was valid.
Travel between the numerous islands in Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lomboki earthquake is on its way to Paluu, but it will last at least three days before it reaches a new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's existing infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign, and he has paid money to improve roads and railways.
However, there has been a problem with the financial crisis, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Some pressures also increase the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more ancient form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have engaged in street fighting with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, which has led to the death of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is sinking a late strike against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's death on Saturday after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got the bait from Xherdan Shaqir 27 miles from Chelsea's goal when his team was at a loss position.
He moved the ball to the left before he hit the shot towards the back.
The shot rolled high across the penalty zone towards the right corner.
Finally, the ball fell across Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make me play to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play as far up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com website.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch, and I opened without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match during the half-time 1-0 after the Belgian Emen Hadard painting in 25 minutes.
The Blues cart gave the main entrance to Mateo Kovac before he drove off near the middle field and smuggled to the Liverpool field.
Kovac played a quick wall feed in the middle of the field.
And then he released Hadrd's penalty zone with a great feed.
He ran off the defense and passed through Liverpool's Alsson Becker's left leg in the back corner.
Liverpool meets the champions in the league block phase of Naples Wednesday at 15 a.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet with UEFA on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami's death rate rises to 832 deaths
On Sunday, the Indonesian Disaster Agency reported an earthquake and a loss of tsunami to 832 victims.
At the press conference, editor Sutopo Purwo reported that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, when the 7.5 Magnified earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves of up to six metres high.
The debris of the damaged buildings spread widely to the city of Please, with 380 000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death.
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning began a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 at Grayson Mews on John Street, who was arrested for murder by a 32-year-old man.
Police are asking the people in the area to register if they've seen or heard anything.
Crime Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to all those in Birkenhead near John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to anyone, especially the cabs, who may have recorded something on the camera video, to contact the police. They may have vital information from the point of view of the investigation".
The female reporter from the police has confirmed that the dead woman is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, the crime scene has become persons who may have known a woman who have asked about her location.
As the investigation goes on, the police tell me that they're trying to inform the victim of what happened close to him.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told me that no one would get out of the building or out.
He was out of words when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that you can go for hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the scene.
He repeated his saying, "It's terrible."
In the two afternoons, there were two Mayes in the isolated area, and outside there was a third.
There were a number of police officers in the isolated area who were monitoring the floorroom.

Mr Cromwell's statue was involved in the reconstruction of history
It would therefore be a poetic right to exterminate the statue, considering that his own fanatical puritacans destroyed British cultural and religious monuments as well as the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "peryde" and "rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would be the target of Oliver Cromwell's statue at the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't order or execute English civil war iconlass.
Wrong Cromwell might have to suffer from the actions of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's wonderful description of Cromwell reflects the opinion of the 1800s and is a historical evidence of a figure that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, although perhaps more in the 1800s than today, consider Cromwell as Parliament's defender against external pressure, which, of course, in this case, was caused by monarchs.
Whether a precise description of the subject is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
At least it is certain that in the mid-600s, our nation has formed a later development. Cromwell, on the other hand, must identify a character representing the other side of that division.
In addition, his achievements as head of state deserve praise and memory".
Killer's tailed by a Chinese farmer's death
The local media reported that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him on this market in South-East China.
Only the body of a man identified by his last name "Yuan" was found near the Liupanshui market in Guizhou County, where the man’s artery was broken and he was high in the blood, the South China Morning Post news on Sunday.
The flock is prepared to vaccinate pigs in the siala on 30 May 2005 in Xining Province of Qingha, China.
His news with his cousin from the Yunna Province, on Wednesday, was intended to sell 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door to the nearby piglands was open.
When he was a pig, he said he saw a big scream, with his mouth in his blood.
According to the news, the forensic investigation confirmed the dead of a 250-kunda-knob farmer.
Guiyang Eventing News says a cousin named Wu said that my cousin's feet were bloody and condited.
The surveillance camera photo shows that the cousin arrives at the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the market told Eventing News that the pig had been locked in order not to damage other police gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and histories are told to negotiate the death case compensation.
It is known that pigs have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, an almost 300 - pound pig climbed the Walesian farmer against this tractor until the wife managed to alert the animal’s way.
In 2012, a farmer living in Manitoba told CBC News that even though pigs are not usually aggressive, blood taste can function as a "fill".
"They're just playing.
They're like young children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
All you have to do is respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring extensive heavy rainfalls to the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to decline as it shifts to the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, Rosa will, however, bring floods to North Mexico and the United States for lunch.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 metres per second, i.e. the 1st class hurricane, from a Sunday morning’s East Coast time, and was 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugene in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure on the Pacific Ocean, heading eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As I arrive on the California peninsula as a tropical storm, it begins to put deep tropical moisture northwards towards the United States.
Rosa brings up 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
In the coming days, tropical moisture, which interacts with approaching low pressure, is a wide area of rain to lunch.
Local rainfalls of between 25 and 100 millimetres cause dangerous heavy rainfalls and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes rainfalls of between 50 and 75 mm per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona, in certain areas.
For certain areas in lunch and especially in Arizona up to 50 to 100 millimetres of rain are expected.
Heavy rainfalls are possible, and conditions can quickly reduce due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In case of tropical rain, it is recommended that you avoid leaving the wilderness on foot.
The rainfalls can transform the canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms create local windfalls and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rainfalls to the coasts of Southern California.
The rainfalls of more than 10 millimetres are possible, causing small waste streams and soluble roads.
It would be the first rain of the rain season in the area.
The fragmented tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday until the rain expands on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last throughout the middle week.
In October, in the United States, there can be strong fluctuations in temperatures as the Arctic area cooled down, but while the tropic remains quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
In the middle of the United States an excellent example of high temperature differences will be seen on Sunday.
The distance between Kansas City, Missouri and Omahan and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moins is almost 20 degrees.
The summer’s sequencing heat is once again trying to strengthen and expand in the coming days.
From the beginning of October it is expected to be warm in the middle and eastern parts of the United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees known as the south of the plains.
In New York, temperature can be painful on Tuesday +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, the East of the United States has a great opportunity for higher temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Tuesday, more than 20 million people watched a broadcast by six television channels, where Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blassey Ford, who charged him with sexual assault in the 1980s, gave their testimony fascinating.
At the same time, the political patent situation continued with the suspension of television companies on the last minute's transmission, which states that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation on the charges imposed by Senator Jeff Flake on the basis of an agreement.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% sure that he had been strangled by Kavanaugh and tried to take off his clothes at high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional witness statement saying that he was 100 percent certain that this was not the case.
More observers were likely than 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company decreased the average Viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers in offices.
Some proportions say that the reading corresponds to the number of viewers in the American football playoff game or Oscar.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers from all television companies was Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, with an average of 5,69 million viewers throughout the day's consultation.
ABC was second with 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3,1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 89 million and CNN had 2,52 million viewers.
After the hearing, the interest was still high.
At the center of Friday's drama was Flake.
The camera by CNN and CBS described how the protesters' screams escorted him to the elevator on Friday to consult the Legal Affairs Committee.
CNN showed me straight how he was standing at the minute shop looking down on the playoffs.
"Seison right in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he'll tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless", they said to him."
Mr Flake said that he had given his office an opinion and added that before the elevator doors were closed, he would have more to speak after the committee's hearing.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs started voting on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the vote in the Senate plenary.
However, Flake said that he was only working with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake became convinced of his friend, with the democratic director Chris Coons, based on his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames the criticism of Brexit's policies
In an interview with Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday Times, his EU-wide plans for critical policies that threaten the future of Britain and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls on the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should impose import duties on each other, "I'm completely out of line".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: the police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect for the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a person as a suspect in LSU who played basketball for shooting a 20-year-old Wayde Sims dead.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and according to Baton Rouge's police department, he's being charged with murder at second degree.
The authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's interview where the police told me that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found the glasses at the scene and told me that they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police are telling me that Simpson admitted Wayden's shooting at interrogations.
According to Advocate magazine, his guarantee amount was set at USD 350 000.
On Friday, the medical examiner of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The Agency would like to thank the Louisiana State Police task force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, head of LSU's movement, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "newity and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-foot attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball in LSU.
He recorded on average 5.6 points and 2.6 records in the match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said he was "sacred" and "scred" about Wayden's death.
"You always fear something like this", Wayde said.
The volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
The ash released from the Popotapetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre called on citizens to stay away from the volcano when the crater’s activity accelerated and during the day was registered in 183 gas and ash bursts.
The center registers and vibrates several times.
In social media, photos were released in residential areas such as Mexico City Xochimilco, where the windshields of cars covered thin ash layers.
Geophysics have found an increase of 72 kilometres from the capital to the south of the volcano after the 7.1 Magnitized earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and cataclysmic parasites bring together before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, in Barcelona, six people were arrested in the assembly of independent protestors and mellac police. Thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the divorce.
The police arrested the masked independent supporters who threw the police on eggs and powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled with tourists.
During the day, more chaffs broke out when the police used their pumps to control the locusts.
The contacts between the supporters of independence and the groups of the Union continued for hours, when the previous ones shouted "no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the latter "live Spain".
The local press reports that 14 people received treatment for minor injuries in demonstrations.
The tension is still on the line of independence in the area one year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid declares illegal but celebrated by cataclysmic parasites.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was a minor difference in the boycotts vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year in violent conflicts when police tried to prevent voting in voting stations across the region.
On Fridays, the groups in favour of independence stayed outside to prevent a demonstration by national police.
However, the reminder was arranged, but it had to travel another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was involved in separatists' demonstrations with her wife, said that she was no longer hopeful about the independence of Catalonia.
Last year, we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents cry for joy when they can vote, but now we're stuck in place," he says.
In the last December's regional elections, but despite the vital victory, the speed of the parties in support of the independence of Catalonia has fallen this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are on a voluntary stake or are in custody awaiting trial for their participation in the organisation of referendums and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described the police with her protestal phone, says politicians on both sides of the Lithuanian.
"You're being blackmailed all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 leaders in the state of Catalonia who had been in custody since last year, announced their participation in next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to go into the euro is by condemning the deterioration of democratic values and the oppression that we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.
Londonderry: Men were arrested in a car crash in the house
On his age, 33, 34 and 39, men were arrested after a repeated collision of the car in Londonderry.
The events took place at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 a.m. in Britain.
Detective Detective Bob Blemmmings said the gates and the building were damaged.

Livingston won the Rangers 1-0 in Menga's goal
Dolly Mengan's first goal in Livingston ensured victory
The Sarjanoja Livingston was amazed by Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard to lose the second in 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox Society.
The Dolly Mengan goal was finally enough to win the second place with Hibernian as Gary Holt's team went up.
Gerrard's crew stayed without the first guest victory of the season at Premiership. Next Sunday it will be the serial director Hearts, which is eight points ahead.
In the meantime, the Rangers will meet in the European league of Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued to be the size of six matches in the series, and the head coach Holt has not yet disappeared once since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places for a guest suffering from a lack of steel.
Holt's team should have led long before its goal since the Rangers had had a bad problem with their tightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide, and next, Alan Lithgow was able to slide on the ground floor into Craig Halkett's bag feed, but he passed the ball.
The masters gave the ball management favor to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate themselves from special situations.
That's exactly how the goal came.
Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place to move the ball to the center of the penalty zone and finish.
The Rangers had so far held the ball, but they said the home team's defense had kept it, and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not even able to try.
The same pattern continued during the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalie Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow pushed the ball past another special situation in Livingston.
The rainfalls in the Livingston Penitentiary were continuously cleaned, and two of the situations were also called for an unnecessary penalty-off from the ball that had hit Glenn Middleton and his hand.
"The ultimate performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the ascending wires.
The team's playing method and crew haven't changed much since it got back to the highest serial level.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was so great in leading an excellent organized defense, while Menga was holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to the whole match.
But there were no ideas from the Rangers.
The team has been performing really well at times under Gerrard, but it is now far from his standard.
The last input was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once. This should work as an inspiration for the Rangers, which is the middle box of the series table.
Erdogan got a variety of receptions in Cologne.
The smile was sensitive and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met with breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey lives in the city.
The police stopped 25 000-headed support teams from gathering in front of the Musketeer, justifying this for safety reasons, but there were still a lot of supporters gathered around to see the President.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices to the people, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German Government to invite him to the country.
The competing demonstrations reflect the distribution of views, and some German Turks greet him as heroes in other people's lovers of themselves.
Road accident in Deptford: A biker dies in a collision with a car
A biker died when he ran into a car in London.
The accident occurred at about ten local times in Deptford's lunch section near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which has live traffic.
The car driver stopped and the care personnel came to help the victim, but he died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash site.
The city police are telling me that they're trying to identify the man and inform his friends.
There are roadblocks on site and bus traffic has been diverted elsewhere. The drivers have been invited to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report a high level of security classification for men who have been injured by six prison guards in prison unrest.
At HMP Long Lartin, Wrocestershire, approximately 9:30 p.m., on Sunday, the time of Britain continues and continues.
There are Tornado Special Police to calm down unrest, behind which eight prisoners are in one prison wing.
There were little police face injuries being treated at the scene.
One prison officer said: "HMP Long Lartin has been sent to a prison staff with special training to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into account by the police and may have to spend longer hours behind bars."
The HMP Long Lart prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The president was told that he was hospitalized in June after an attack on him by one of the prisoners.
In addition, in October, riot police were called to the prison for serious unrest in which people were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rainfall threats to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the drought areas can benefit)
Arizona is rarely accompanied by tropical low pressure, but that is what is happening at the beginning of next week, when the residues of Hurricane Rosa are transferred above the southern desert, bringing with them a heavy risk of rainfalls.
The national weather service has already given a warning of the heavy rainfalls on Mondays and Tuesdays from West Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south of California and Utah, as well as the towns of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The rose is expected to advance directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National weather service pointed out in its twitter. "Only ten tropical storms have retained the tropical storm or low pressure space at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 65 kilometers from the Arizona border".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict rains of 50 to 100 millimetres.
In other areas of the south-east desert, including the central rock mountains and the Great Basin, it is true that 25-50 millilitres can be obtained. A total of up to 100 millimetres can be rained.
Roosa rains can also be a blessing to dryness by testing the area if there is no heavy risk.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful because of severe drought in the southern coast.
According to the U.S. Dryness Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest category, says Weather.com.
My Hurricane Rosa will first make its route to the California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At that time, it is still a hurricane with a strong wind speed of 135 km per hour, moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm loses its power when faced with colder waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico during the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rains can be heavy and cause a considerable flood risk.
“The California peninsula is expected to be 75-150 millimetres, and up to 250 millimetres is possible”, says Weather.com.
Then Rosa will continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives on the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday mornings. From there it will continue its journey through Arizona to the south of Utah by the late Tuesday..
"The greatest risks of food or its residues are associated with very heavy rainfalls in the California peninsula, the north-east of Korea and the United States," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfalls and waste streams in deserts, as well as earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murder as suspects after the 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday from 4 a.m. in Britain.
He was taken to a hospital where he's said to be in a "safe" state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in Radstock's area in Avon and Somerset.
Police are asking for contact with anyone who may have video footage of events recorded on the mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party is "devility and anger"
"My voice is the voice of Judge Kavanaugh against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the democratic party", Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that the democratic party that was suffering from Kavanaugh's suffering was "sufficient and anger" throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh proved before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment that would have taken place decades ago in their teen years.
Ford also proved his accusation at hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellentness, nature and courage" that day.
"My voice in favour of the confirmation of the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most prestigious legal students of our time with excellent marines for public service," he told his team in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican voting in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I wasn't just campaigning, I was campaigning in full," he said.
"That's why I'm recycling everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats had taken over the task of 'responsoring and preventing'.
The senior assistant of the Republican Party Management informed CNN that the first important vote on the Kavanaugh appointment procedure is expected to take place at the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia and tsunamis are expected to rise.
On Saturday the authorities reported at least 384 dead major earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many were wiped out along the huge waves that hit the beaches.
Please, hundreds of people were gathered on Friday at the festival on the city's shores, when waves up to six metres high hit the beach at nightfall. Many began to drown in the destruction of their waves all their way.
Tsunam caused a massive earthquake with 7.5 magnits.
When the threat of tsunami appeared yesterday, the people were still on the beach, and they did not leave immediately to escape when they were victims," says BNB's informant Purwo Nugroho Jakarta of Indonesia's major accidents.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it carried cars, wood hulls, houses and strike all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached an open sea at 800 km an hour before its impact on the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunamis by climbing into trees, he tells.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The images published by the Disasters Agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The trail tracks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes seemed to live in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Office for Technology Assessment and Implementation of Indonesia, BPPT, issued an opinion that the energy released during the huge earthquake of Friday was responsible for some 200 atomic bombs dropped in the Second World War in Hiroshima.
It says that the settlement of a long and narrow bay at the end of the city could cause the tsunami to shine.
Nugroho described the destruction as a "large" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had fallen.
He reported that some of the bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of the damaged buildings and added that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and damage may be greater than 300 kilometers north of the coast, in the region of Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communications "they're completely out of control, and there's no information from Dongga" says Nugroho.
According to the statement given by the Red Cross, more than 300 000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the region.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not telling us that the tsunami had hit Paluu, but the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In a social media-based amateur video, the man upstairs of the building loudly shouts at people who come from the tsunamis on the street who are approaching warnings.
Only minutes later on the beach, there is a water wall that takes buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately verify the reality of the image matrix.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread electrical failure, which cut off communication connections, Please, make it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The authorities say that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and from other cities on the transport machines, but you still need food and other supplies to evacuate.
The city airport has only been reopened for aid operations and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami victim number exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision Donggala's personnel have reached security Please tell Dosheba, where they have been housed in tentative roofs in the inner courtyard of the office.
"They told me that they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
At the start of the donor groups, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Paluu.
According to the Indonesian provisions, financing, equipment and personnel coming from abroad can only begin to flow once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a county disaster," says Aulia Arriani, journalist of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can begin to receive international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made".
When the other night landed Please after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members in the lost hope that their close wonders would be different from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was raised from the barrel.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian dependent team, had trained two dependent players on the cover for Asian races that had previously ended this month.
The Roa Roa hotel was also trapped in his students, says Mandagi.
"As an older member of the flagpole, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he was desperate to reach participants in the beach festival Please compete with WhatsApp messages after the news of the fall of Roa Roa’s hotel spread among the association community.
However, only one grey mark appeared after the messages sent by him instead of two blues.
"I understand that messages have not been sent," he says.

According to the press, a number of witnesses saw them escape from the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons with information on their identity are requested to contact the Newport Police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Swinger will change its name, Ye
I'm gonna change my name to Kanye West.
When he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: "happiness who used to be known as Kanye West".
Ye has been the last name of the 41-year-old West for a while now, and he also used it as his eighth album published in June.
The change is preceded by his coming appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Granden, who, according to the creator of the program, canceled his participation for "sensical reasons".
West has previously told him that the word also has religious significance for him, not only for it to shorten his trade name.
When I discussed the album earlier this year with the radiojourner Big Boy, West said, "I believe that "yes" is the most common word of the Bible, and there it means "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began with Kanya, which means nothing more than nothing, and ended up in a shorter shape, Ye - which just reflects the goodness, evil, confusion, all of it.
The album is mainly a reflection on who we are".
He's one of several known rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs is known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would prefer names of Love and Brother Love.
Also West's previous partner JAY-Z has removed and restored the link and the big letters.
Mexico AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, who was present on Saturday at the Tlatelico Plaza Square, promised not to use "the army for the repression of the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, armed forces fired from the peaceful protest, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were entering Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly study grants and by opening up more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and training opportunities would lead young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
The United States should double its funding for research into artificial intelligence when China enhances its activity in the field. This is what says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier, working with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by communications on the artificial intelligence of the various parts of the US administration, although there was no formal artificial intelligence strategy in the United States.
In the meantime, China has already presented its plan last year: it will seek to lead the development of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget would be a good start, considering that other countries are so much behind the United States, and that we are looking for a next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," says Lee.
The double funding could double the probability that the next major artificial intelligence gain would be done in the United States, Lee told us in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Works: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO in Sinovation Venture, who has established one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face+++.
In the 1980s, he developed a artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, who beat the highest punishable Othello player in the United States. Later he acted as a leader of Microsoft Research and as a leader of Google's activities in China.
Lee recognised previous US government technology competitions such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be organised to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers worked hard to get public aid.
"The academics are not taking China, they're taking the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting the top universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think the performers of artificial intelligence should automatically issue green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government's next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
The US Department of Defence was established earlier this year by the Defence Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together the partners of the world of industry and academics.
DARPA also announced this month about a $2 billion investment in AI Next initiative.
In turn, NSF invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the bill for establishing a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not progressed for months.
The Macedonian people in the referendum to change the name of the country
In a Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. The change would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
In the view of the Greek province of Macedonia, the name of the northern neighbour is, in practice, a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its access to EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries concluded an agreement on a new proposal for a name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Somali majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the required 50 % threshold will be reached in order to ensure that the result is legal.
The question in the vote was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece'.
The supporters of a roll change like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has risen from the fall of Yugoslavia, can seek to join both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote in favour of the future of our country, in favour of Macedonia's young people, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a number of Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
The change in name requires two-thirds of the majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Board, no irregularities were reported by 13 o'clock.
However, the turnout was only 16. Compared with the previous 2016 parliamentary elections to 34 per cent, when 66 per cent of the voting rights were finally put to the vote.
"I came to vote for my children and place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Mr Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Mr Dushko, voted in the referendum on the change in the name of Macedonia in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set chairs before the tents set by the boycotts at Skopje Parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads upright, and not through the kitchen door, said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us in Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, as part of the euro area integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring an ambitious investment in Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe a large majority in favour of voting for the name change, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said "yes" to the voice is "enveloping our future".
The opinion poll published by the European Institute of Political Research on Monday referred to 30-43% voting activity in the referendum - that is, the activity required below.
57 per cent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday in the second survey by FYROM TV.
Of them, 70% said they were voting for the 'yes' option.
In order to succeed the referendum, the voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of a referendum would be the first serious setback to a Western-minded government after its coming to power in May of last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero beat the whole Brighton defense against his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made clear of Brighton's defense against Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made his goal look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentine top player received the feed from the middle field.
He found an empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton supporters.
Then Aguero found that the four green shirts were surrounded.
He passed one of the defenders and then left several others behind on the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, which passed the Brighton guard at the right angle of Mathew Ryan's goal.
The city manager, Pep Guardiola, told the editors that "Aguero has problems with his legs".
"We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Lucky he did the paint in that time."
Still, Sterling had already given the heavenly advantage in the fight against the electors.
The painting came in 29 minutes.
As a matter of fact, Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful passover to Leroy San on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the back of the back of Sterling.
The sky blue attacker pulled the ball into the net just before the end line.
City meets Hoffenheim’s champions’ league at 12:55 in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleading player in a fight against Rockies.
The Nationals are out of the playoff, so why do we have to try to get a start?
However, Scherzer is always hoping to take over the feed ring at the Sunday match against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockys still has a playbook. They have one victory difference in the Los Angeles Dodgers Western series.
Rockies took at least a wild card at his 5-2 victory from the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division victory.
"While we don't have a bet, at least we can get up to the incubator, knowing that the atmosphere of the public and the other team here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive clause I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take the challenge?"
Nationals have not yet published their beginners on Sunday, but according to information, they tend to give Scherzer an opportunity in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, and he would play at the beginning of his 36th game, and feed it on Sunday on his normal rest shift.
This season, Washington's right-hand player has a gain/loss ratio of 18-7. The ERA statistics are 2.53 and he's burned the hitter's nest 300 times, with a parallel statistics of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation of his Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who, at the same time, spoke of the importance of Republican voting in the elections.
"All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one really great -- not just a campaign, but a campaign full, and that's why I'm going all over the place to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "you see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to go back to power by whatever means possible, and you can see their vandalities and their greed.
They do not choose who will be hurt or who must be crucified so that they can gain power; that is what they want, power and power, but we do not give it to them".
He said that the Democrats have taken over the task of 'responsoring and preventing'.
"And it has been visible in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "abuse and mean and evil, and lying."
In his reference to Dianne Feinstein, the audience, acting as the most influential democratic player in the Senate's Committee of Justice, was responsible for the sound sound.
"Do you remember his answer?
You leaked the document?
Uh, what?
Well, no, I'm expecting a little... it was really bad body language... the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerance congregation.
It doesn't tolerate people who say their opinions.
I was not really surprised when my local party, Momentum activists, supported the motion of censure against me.
At least at least I'm the last one of Labour's representatives to whom I'm told I'm not welcome... just because we're saying our opinions.
My Parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was critical of the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Among the topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting stated on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I have been a local representative of Labouri, Friday sized by the party council, have been just that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and the policy of "friendly and gentler" has long since been forgotten if it ever began.
It is even more obvious that the Labour Party will no longer tolerate different opinions and that each opinion will be assessed on the basis of whether or not it is appropriate for the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and the colleagues who had thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect me to be fully translated and to whom I would never have agreed, whether it was national security or the internal market in the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is an insult to social media calling for my choice to be cancelled, for rejecting a central policy, and for me to hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow Members, because the comments directed at me are, at least, political in nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day, and never to be discouraged.
The normalisation of such treatment is one of the most disturbing aspects of the policy of this era.
Last week Jeremy Corby demanded that the Labour Party adopt a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and as a result of every motion of censure or change in the rule of choice, the party becomes more limited.
For two years I have been invited to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "all would go well".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure of the Thatcher Government to become a single school school, I have been both a city councillor and a minister's role to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never covered my political lines, not even last night's elections.
No one in the district of Nottingham East has been surprised by my viewpoints or differences with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that, when the state is moving towards a Brex that is detrimental to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my true message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honour, and the threat of separation or the promotion of political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your interests.
Chris Leslie is a Member of the Parliament of the Nottingham East district.
Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr in Block Claw
Two final moments of paint slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undisputedly deserved victory at the entertaining Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who have not lost any match.
Excellent defense and more successful taking risks were ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie could for a reason be satisfied.
"We've been challenged in our fights and we're still undefeated, so I can be happy." He says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All honors to Ayri, they took risks better than we do."
At 14 minutes, Ayr took the lead with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion match, but the yellow card of the Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who gave away the Warriors match, enabled Melros to rise, and Jason Baggott made the goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in penalty paintings, and just before the half-time he made a goal and managed to convert the score, increasing Ayri's management to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round very well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which, in the conversion match, Baggot managed to narrow down the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the fight when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out from the field. In the game, Ayr continued to increase his leadership with Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo managed.
Ayri Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a hard pressure after a goal that was unable to reversion.
The home team, however, responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the unballed Climo, and Macpherson scored the goal of leaving the Ayri maul.
Climo succeeded in a conversion match the same way he used to do, and Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and tied Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal in his home team.
The star of the Still Game series starts in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran has been appointed head of the licensed restaurant company and is likely to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
A 56-year-old actor presents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The twins have announced that the coming ninth season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kierna is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to the public register, he has been appointed Head of the Company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested Kierna wanted to include him in the flourishing restaurant business of Glasgow.
"I belong to us": the inland state Bolivia is trying to get back in touch with the Pacific by legal action
Marines patrol the fleet base outside La Paz.
The flag of the public buildings has a sea blue flag.
The vessel's bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been pushed down by the strike statement: "The sea is ours, quite rightly.
It is our duty to get it back."
On the coasts of the 18th century, we still have a strong line to remember Chile, as we do once again in the Pacific Ocean, when we lost our home country in Bolivia.
The hope is at its highest for decades when Bolivia looks forward to the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has strong progress, co-existence and synthesis, and, of course, a positive attitude towards the prospect of a final solution," said the Bolivian diplomat at Roberto Calzad.
Several bolivias from all over the country, as hopeful of the decision of the International Court of Justice from large squares, hoping that the Hague will be in favour – after decades of the lengthy debate – the Bolivian position that Chile will have a duty to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The Brazilian charismatic President, Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the controversial struggle next year, has a lot to play next Monday.
"The return to the Pacific is very close", he convinced me that it would come to the end of August.
However, some of the analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it were decided, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-based UN institution has no competence to hand over Chile's administrative areas, and the ICJ has also announced that it will not determine the end of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision is only given six months after the final submission of comments suggests that the case "is not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed down rather than contribute to Bolivia's goal.
"The current Bolivian regime has seized the question of sea connection," said Zárate.
Morales' challenging rhetoric has suppressed the rest of Chilean charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile continue their discussions at some point, but it is very difficult to organise negotiations afterwards.
There has been no second embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and representative of Bolivia in the Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the court decision would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "save 139-year-old differences in mutual benefit", he said.
Calzad also contests that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the question of maritime transport in political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to join the Pacific," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announced that nuclear isolation would not happen unless it could be trusted in the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He recalled the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit by Heads of State.
Rin's statement came just before the US Secretary of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo is reopening the deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, only three months after the US met Kim Jong Uni in Singapore.
Ri said that it was a 'long dream' to believe that the continued sanctions and the United States' opposition to the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken significant measures to promote weapons withdrawal, Washington is equipped to adopt a declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want a new summit.
But the view that Pjongjang was about to abandon the armed arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real means of securing its own security, has gained extensive doubts.
Pompeo is about to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump Summit.
Paris’s fashion studios present the large-scale majors of the latest collection, which are about to be near your street
If you want to magnify your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 exhibition, a selection of special over-the-head hairs that were dazzling the styles of Paris' fashion weeks.
The highly impractical mains took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion stands.
Valentino’s most prominent creation was a broad-based beige hat with feathers, which covered the heads of the models almost entirely.
Other oversized dwellings included watermelon, velvet, and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of different masks — just before Halloween.
In many colourful masks, lips were sewn, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the top fashion.
One creature with snorkels and masks reminded me more of the means of diving, and one reminded me of the sweet ice cream.
And if you want to take a position on the size of a fashion, you got lucky.
The followers of the fashion predict that the giant hooves are about to appear in the street picture.
The hats of oversized size are closely followed by La Bomba, a shoulder saw from all Rihana to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the richly visible cultic design of unprescripted hat was also tied to the fashion material of the second size creation – a shoulder bag made of straw, which is almost as large as the model bearing it.
The burnt orange with the jugular decoration of the raffiform with white leather hand straps was the most outstanding creation of Jacques La Riviera’s SS19 design stand in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large-scale hats and bracelets in the street picture next summer – designers have made such a great impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale apartments."
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for a world citizen
The results of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued as a result of good results in 2018. The success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30 000 pupils located across Scotland, represented by the SSCIS, are seeking to provide a high level of service to their students and to their parents.
Private schools are trying to prepare their students for the career they have chosen, for higher education and higher education, and for global citizenship.
As an educational operator who can design and implement tailor-made learning content, we have noticed the role of languages as a popular and desirable subject in continuing education institutions.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build trust in people from other countries.
For the most recent results this year, we find that the languages are at the top of the lists for the percentage of access between private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest rating of A.
Based on the data, students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently free choice materials, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural substances (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey carried out by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it was clear that 17% of the situations where the employer had difficulties finding a suitable employee’s job were explained by insufficient language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the promotion of young people's career development.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills form in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have the advantage of this lifelong skill in the future, regardless of what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically put a language-qualified person first in the race.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, 75 per cent of over 4 000 isobritan adults cannot have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language that had a double-digit figure of 15 per cent.
This is why placing languages into teaching is important now for existing children.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposed to be important for the isobritans in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child’s interest, private schools always have a number of language options taught by specialised teachers.
In Scotland, private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills that are needed to succeed, whatever the future brings when it comes.
In this time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
The current languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and a high level of Scotland for young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
Mr. John Edward is head of the Scottish private school council SCIS
LeBron makes a debut on Sunday at San Diego
The expectation of LeBron James' first performance in the Los Angeles Lakers ranks is almost over.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets on Sunday at San Diego before the season starts in the game to play.
But how many minutes he'll really be playing, I'll see.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Mike Trudell, editor of the Lakers, twitted that James is likely to be playing for unqualified minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers before the six games to be played through.
"At this point in my career, I don't need pre-games to prepare anymore," he said.
Time for the Trumpi Western Virginia campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a election campaign in Wheeling today in West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of the five next weeks' scheduled election, including all the helpful targets, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for the vote in order to fill the free place of the Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to increase support for future elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in November elections.
What time is Trump's Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The event of Trump in West Virginia Wheeling begins at 19 a.m. during the time of the East Coast on Saturday, 29.9.2018.
You can watch Trump's Western Virginia campaign event online as a livestrim through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump would take the highest court this week to consult with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who was subject to intense sexual harassment charges, which have delayed the Senate's confirmation of the prosecutions made during the week in the FBI's investigation.
But the primary objective for a series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in tight elections in November.
Therefore, the five events of the next week's campaign by President Trump were commented on the intention to 'create volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives', according to Reuters.
"The rule of the Congo is so essential that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the urgent campaign period," told Reuters, an anonymous representative of Trump's campaign.
Today's event is in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and even in "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia during the current month, in the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports the Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in opinion polls.
"From the point of view of Morisey, it is not a good sign that the President is trying to increase his support in opinion polling," said state scientist Simon Haeder, according to the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the will to fight to keep hope before Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions on Saturday night four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the force to strengthen success in sport is a completely invented phenomenon, players still believe in it and even more in tournaments such as this.
Where do they find this success at the moment?
"They had six points of leadership that narrowed down to four, so we take this as a success," said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, a priority: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in the sails and a lot to be encouraged, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which enabled them to play all day together and got three points out of four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the bricks to the green, leading with an example.
The hoarse voices of the victory party grew stronger as he entered his round as he succeeded in a critical putt to the level of four when he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
A pot where they won the 15th match followed a similar cry that gave the impression that he believed that the United States team had not yet disappeared.
"You need to focus really well and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make a difference.
The only players who have got more points when Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special but sweet twin has won four out of four without a doubt.
"Moliwood" was the only twin who didn't make any bugs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and receive energy from this busy audience, confirms that they are pre-stakers on Sunday. And when the sun drops at Le Golf National, another more popular player could not be than Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd prefer both at the same time on different holes.
The speeches on Europe's success are, of course, premature.
Bubba Watson and Wemb Simpson quickly defeated the paired Sergio Garcia with Alex Noren, who was the hero of the four-game in the morning.
One bug and two double Abogs at the first nine holes dug so deep into the hole that they were not even close to surviving there.
But on Sunday, no one's coming to help you get out of the pit.
Four ball and four game are fascinating to follow from a close relationship point of view: What kind of advice they give or leave without giving and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team until now and taken a major lead before the last day, but this four-game shows that the United States team has a willingness to fight, even though it has been suspected in particular in the United States.
Europe will take 10-6 leadership before Ryder Cup's last day
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they took the lead from the United States on Saturday's four-balls and four-games.
The brilliant twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory with two winnings from the rapper Tiger Woods, and they got the score high at four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to maintain the victory he lost two years ago in Hazeltin, dominated a weakly played United States team in four-ball in the morning, taking the match to the situation 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games winning two games, but they were unable to narrow down the leadership.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 on Sunday to keep a victory.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, who are also called "Molliwood", were the second double in Ryder Cup's history, which has won four points in the first four games.
After breaking into the four-ball game, Woods and Patrick Reed, they then finished the super-embarked Woods and the U.S. beginner, Bryson Dechambeau, even more forcefully 5-4.
Woods, who barely survived Saturday through two matches, was at times very great, but still has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-games, and even seven consecutives.
Justin Rose rested in the morning with four balls, but he and Henrik Stenson went back to four games, but he lost 2-1 for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third in the wrists.
Europe did not get everything it wants this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The triple prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the U.S. on two points on Saturday.
They won a two-to-one victory in Spain from Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter in four-ball, and later on four-three victorys from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four-game after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history, the team has risen from four points behind-run to levels at the start of the double games, even though Furyk's side of the draw is enough to maintain victory.
After two days of the second best, though, it may be that the counter- attack on Sunday is too much to ask.
North Korea "not in any way" took away its own weapons without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN that continued sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that during the last year, North Korea has "made significant measures of good faith", such as the end of nuclear and missile tests, launched a nuclear test site and promised that North Korea would not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"But we haven't seen such a gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain that national security will be maintained, so under such circumstances, the fact that we would be taking our arms off unilaterally is not possible."
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaint stream that Washington does not accept the phased surrender of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for each incident, his statement is, however, important in the sense that the unilateral weapons withdrawal is not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has done before.
Ri referred to the joint resolution by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. President-in-Office meeting in Singapore on 12 June, the opinion by Kim convinced the Korean peninsula of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been trying to officially end the war in Korea between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pjongjang be released from its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed facilitating strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The United States are calling for 'unstinct withdrawals first', and have increased the pressure with sanctions to achieve their goals with a mob – even against the 'definition of peace', Ri said.
"The fear that sanctions would bring us to our knees is the uninterrupted hope.
But the problem is that continuous sanctions only deepen our confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Tump summit, which Trump, however, himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader, Moon Jae, during the last five months and added: "If the arms-responsible party were South Korea or the United States, the situation would not have advanced to such a deadlock."
However, Rin's tone was significantly different from last year when he told at the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States continents was inevitable after the "bad president" Trump called Kim "a missile manor" on suicide plans.
Last year Trump threatened "to completely destroy" North Korea. This year, however, Trump called on Kim to draw close to the arms release, but stressed that there was still much left to work and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea abandoneds nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he did not have a time limit: "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward the progress made by Pjongjang.
However, the US Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions should continue to be strong and without failure as long as we prove that we are abandoning the full, definitive and established nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with its objective of expediting the financial channels for the production of the ballistic and nuclear missiles in Pjongyang.
Pompeo met with North Korea in connection with the UN General Assembly, and he also announced his visit to Pjongyang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times since this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pjongjang, he described progress as having been made. However, North Korea condemned Pompeon’s “gangsterical requirements” only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to closing the missile base and the nuclear installation at the meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month, in the event that the United States is carrying out "corresponding measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "consisting measures" security guarantees Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete sufficient rest at the guidance course
Harvard University's students participate in this year's course with the aim of increasing student rest. The course is a resistance to the flourishing macho culture at the university, where students weigh long nights with caffeine power.
According to the researcher, students from the world's best university are often quite ignorant about fundamental matters relating to their own well-being.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of Harvard University of Medicine, who works on a dream study at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course when he lectured on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"After reading, a young woman came to my talks, saying, "Why am I only hearing about it now, the last year of my study?"
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which, in my opinion, was surprising," said Telegraph in an interview.
For the first time this year's course guides students on how right dreams support academic and sporting performances and improve overall well-being.
Professor of Harvard University Medical Science and Deputy Head of University Health Services, Paul Barreira, says that the university ended its course after they had heard how students were suffering from severe sleep shortages during the study week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section of the student presents a picture of the living room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books and thus obtain information about the effects of caffeine and light and the effect of sleepiness on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants about how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive campus map encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate effect on students' behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," adds Professor Czeisler.
According to Professor Czeisler, all night long study Marathons are still a topic of pride, and modern technology and the ever-growing pressures of students have made a growing problem of sleep shortages.
"To get sufficient and high quality sleep should be a student's ' secret weapon' against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against increasing weight, because sleep shortages are causing a state of hunger in the brain, which is why man is constantly hungry," the professor points.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old in chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler in the design of the course after he had attended one of his courses during his first years in Harvard last year.
He reports that the course opened his eyes and gave a spark to all campus students to arrange a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all future students could complete a similar set of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a wake-up clock to also remind them of bedtime, not only in the morning, but also in the morning, and urges them to keep in mind the side effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the daily cycle, which may make it more difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan's shot took victory from Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again experienced a lost day when Dolly Menga's shot brought a 1-0 victory through the defense against Livingston.
Ibrox’s players were about to claim their first victory then February 4-1 game, which was held against St. Johnstone. Gary Holt’s team, however, took over this time, and Gerrard now only experienced his second defeat during his 18 game manager career. Rangers stayed eight points away from the current leader of the dial game in Hearts.
Menga poured the ball into the finish line seven minutes before the half-time, and the situation was no longer addressed in the Rangers' fallout after this.
The Rangers fell as a result of the game in the sixth place. Livingston has instead climbed to the third place, and the difference between the goal is only Hibernia.
The Rangers may face other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when he hit the head of a foreign object and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges in the formation of Ayrin and advanced to the Scottish league semi-finals.
The Holt continued with the Liv 11 meeting, where the team took a point from Hearts last week. Again, the same strategy produced results when a well-structured composition managed to discipline the opponent almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better to take advantage of situations.
Livingston had the opportunity to get the goal at two minutes, when the first input from Mengan gave Scott Pittman a free way to the Allan McGregor goal, but Pittman failed to make use of the opportunity.
After this, Keaghan Jacobs directed his release to Craig Halkett, but the other defender, Alan Lithgow, was only able to launch a large set of backs.
On the other hand, the Rangers took control of the game, but the last third of the game was no longer self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombian requests.
In the first half of the year, Rangers managed to try only two goals. However, former goalkeeper Liam Kelly rejected the powerless launch of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long-run feeds.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who could have cold-headed the ball to Menga for easy paint.
Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change almost immediately affected the game when Kent created a suitable hole for Morelos. However, the attack was broken by Kelly’s impressive quick defense.
Livingston had visitors play their own game again when Lithgow and Halkett continued their long feeds after each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to raise its leadership at the last minute of the game. However, McGregor’s fine defense prevented Jacobs’ intentions before Lithgow reached his positions at the corner.
With the exchange of Rangers, Glenn Middleton also demanded that he be held together with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermeter Inventor
The following page is entitled "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882. John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which later led to the development of a machine known as a geigermeter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also the key concept of pop culture. For example, the film "Coronado watches" published in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present scientists with a special influence on herds:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigerometer, it's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really riding!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 for a few days before his 63th birthday.
But he's still a figure that carries his name.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system ‘to see’ malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system ‘to see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ a variety of food-specific proteins
Dogs have shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, cancer cells in patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory in such a way that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2-proteins for many foods. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Institute for National Cancer in Bethesda describes the method: "This is a very promising vaccine on the basis of our findings."
HER2 "to guide the growth of several types of cancer" Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer, and ovarian cancer, lung and colon cancer."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went to critics' teeth after he praised Trumpia Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
No presentation according to plan
Kanye West got into his neck the soundings of Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump and reporting that he was going to be president in the elections of 2020.
After presenting his third song "Ghost Town", the Trump's Make America Great Again campaignmate West attacked the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
"I often talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's racist.
If racism had been a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
The evening’s broadcast began at the Skitters, where Matt Damon derailed Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing in the Senate Legal Committee. The hearing relates to Ms Christine Blassey Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment.
West's fasting was not presented on a live broadcast, but the comedy Chris Rock downloaded it into a bitter social media.
I don't know if Rock's purpose is to mock the West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been subjected to abuse because of the hat he held on his head.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I'm in the margin," West says at an interview with Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be at the margin?" and says that you're going to dress up for the Superman sign because "that's when you can't order what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move on?
Try to love me."
According to Variety, West's comments were admiring the public at least twice, and the performers of the show looked embarrassed, and one of the people present described the situation as follows: "All the studio went completely quiet."
West was chosen for the program during a short warning period to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by presenting the song "I love it" as a bottle of Perrier.
West is to be supported by Candace Turner, leader of a conservative TPUSA organisation, who praised this courage on Twitter: "HITCH IN THE ROSSA".
However, the director of the discussion program, Karen Hunter, quoted that West "is just herself, which is once and for all is wonderful".
"But I can decide to be a human being (by buying this music or brand of clothing or by supporting this "art"), which I believe is damaging to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us," he added.
Before tonight's appearance on Twitter, the Räppäri announced that she had changed her name as a "person known earlier as Kanye Westina".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows here, Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late Prince of Musiclegend, who changed his name to a symbol and later as an artist known before as Prince.
Belfast's restaurant nurse gets charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is accused of a murder attempt after a man was stabbed on Friday at a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident occurred in the area of Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to be brought before the Belgian court on Monday.
The charge is reviewed by the General Public Prosecutor's Office.
Actor Kit Harington will attack toxic masculine.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-reeling hero role in the violent fantasy series Jon Snow'na HBO.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of the machasankar: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys a feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong", and questions the available ways of addressing toxic masculine #MeToo phenomenon in the age of time.
Similarly, Harrington, who is recently married to a 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admits that she has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculineism is that I now have strong feelings," he says.
"What has been taught to men in their growth in years that have led to problems that are now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and its very masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, "What is born inside and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions we have in our day – how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the production of the front or downstream parts of the capital game after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, "made a need for battle fields and horses".
In November Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play on True West, which will tell us about the film producer and this kidnapper brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best thing that the King's Game has offered her.
"I killed my wife in this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life since then" she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love at the Emmy award-winning fantasy series at Harrington's show.
In June 2018, Paris was dedicated to the Leslie family’s accounts in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections has increased 14% in China
China has reported an increase of 14% of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820,000 people in the country.
Some 40 000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the health authorities of China at the conference in Yunnan County, this type of HIV infection has been reduced almost zero.
One year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV infection via sex is an acute issue in the PRC's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against people with LGBT has been reported to be general.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women, due to the conservative values of the country.
Many of the diseases are due to insufficient protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to guarantee the universal availability of HIV medicines as part of the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the employee’s leaking Republican Senator’s information and accused of spreading "dangerous lies" and "salaly theories"
On Saturday, Mr Maxine Waters, U.S. House member, contested the allegations that his employee would have published personal information on the three Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages.
A democratic representative from Los Angeles convinced that there are "exigent" commentators and websites who distribute claims.
"Certain lies, lies, and more depraved lies," says Waters in his statement on Twitter.
Among the information published was the home address and telephone numbers of the Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina and the Utah state of Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown person published information on the US Congress on Thursday during the hearing of the Senate Committee on Women's Rights concerning the charges of sexual abuse against the candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The bleeding happened a little after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundits and RedState report that according to Hill's newspaper, messages were published on the IP address attached to Waters' office and by a person belonging to Waters' staff.
"This unfounded accusation is entirely wrong and it's about absolute lies," Water continued.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these unfair and false accusations, are not in any form responsible for leaking these data.
This unfounded accusation is entirely wrong and absolutely lies."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, and the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was accompanied by critics.
"The man who denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to be hostile.
There's no reason for pride.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
The condition should be moderate and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of excessive hostility during the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters position in Congressan elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he said.
Waters announced that he had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies as a result of these unfair accusations.
"We will ensure that the authors are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be held under legal responsibility for all destructive and dangerous actions against some or all members of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – a sub-efficient Rowan Atkinson agent parodia
It has already established tradition to look for brex references to any film that is expensive to Britain, but this does not seem to fit into Johnny English's fashion and a working comedy series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and relived in the follow-up part of 2011 "John English – Newborn".
Can the tongue of the nation's satir made in cheek become a new British national export campaign?
Or so, the dumb-eyed, rubber-shaped and incompetent Johnny English has already earned its promise to do so again, and his name, above all, tells us that it is a creative creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, a secret agent who desperately seeks to survive the melting glamour around, but it appears as a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Beani and the unhappy one-tier musician in London's 2012 opening concert.
As the bottom of the hook, cosmopolitan and mystical world man have left behind the chaos, which Atkinson originally presented in the already forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard.
The latest performance is a moment.
I particularly liked the scene in which Johnny English arrives on helicopters dressed as a medieval hammer, and the platform of the Rotor is languishing his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy gifts come out, but the humor itself seems to be ineffective and unusually unnecessary, especially because ‘vading’ movie brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task today offer humor as part of the main content of the film.
It seems to me that humorous to children, and the mistreatment of Johnny English doesn't seem as ingenious and sharp as Mr. Bean's cupric comedy from Atkinson.
The repeated starting point every year is that Britain is in trouble for the worst time.
The Cyber hacker is infiltrated in the UK's top secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents on the ground as a working agent's helm – as shown by Kevin Eldon's unfortunate little role.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is already finished with his ears: Emma Thompson will do everything in the faces of Teresa May's parodiah, but the manuscript will not only offer him enough space.
When notifying him that any spy on the ground has been discovered, a person who has already moved away from the active service must be called to the alarm.
It is, of course, a tunarous Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a fine school teacher, but at the same time he provides informal lessons in the art of spyware. The topic excites some clever jokes; English keeps school of Rock-type lessons in intelligence rooms.
English praise will be given to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet his infinitely patient battle partner Bough, who will continue to play Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a dive boatman, whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to get into his rights.
So the disastrous Batmans and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to face the fatal super criminal Ophelia Bhuletova, exhibited by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is becoming a manipulating the charismatic IT billionaire. Jake Lacy's exhibition, Jason Volta, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey turn right into a farce: the two-twilighted servers light up a fine French restaurant and cause chaos when trying to conceal Volta's luxury yacht.
Even the last inhibitions of the performers are exterminated when they come to the final scene, but despite all the insolence and charm, the film still seems a little bit childish.
You can think of the movie as moderate.
As I watch movies, Johnny English, I have come to the same conclusion: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would give him the right to his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week at five-day salary
The Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering the radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but the salary would be paid at five days.
It is said that the party will require companies to transfer the savings generated by an artificial revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, workers could enjoy the three-day weekend at the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘possibly’ a party's economic agenda and its plans for hugging policies for the benefit of the workers.
The central trade union supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Labour Party will tell the Sunday Times: "The revision of the literature was announced before the change of the year.
This change will not take place in the moment, but the four-day working week is the objective of a party's approach to balancing the economy for workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to a four-day working week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective must not be undivided in support in the Labour rows.
The labour force notifier states: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and does not consider moving to it."
John McDonnell, Minister for Finance of the shadow government, took advantage of the work conference held last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "successful dictators" and from "developers" of corporate interests.
According to the plans of the Minister for Finance of the shadow government, current shareholders of water companies would not be able to recover their share as a whole, since the Government led by Labouri could execute the "reductions" on the basis of the abuses detected.
He also confirmed the plans to set up employees in company management and to create in-house ownership funds, which will move 10% of private sector companies to employee management, with an annual contribution of up to GBP 500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy will discuss in 60 minutes' program whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI judge's investigation against Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment as Supreme Court judge. The delay also raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republicans to Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60 minutes section to be sent on Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it would be possible for the FBI to find out things that would enable them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Then of course," Kennedy said.
"By the time I heard you, I said I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him this when the accusations came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, instead, looks like the stone's been killed.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a bomb guarantee," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett highly denied it," Graham added Christine Blasey to Ford.
"No one named him could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see what could change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held in New York on Saturday, is a music event with the card as impressive as its mission: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Today, the 7th-time Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people on New York Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Powery Project, an international consultative group aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people active in the fight against poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket (if you are not willing to pay a VIP ticket), the public must carry out different tasks or "work", such as voluntary work, send an e-mail message to a political decision-makers or make a call, or do any other work that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citizen been successful, now that it has been 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of a free concert ticket reward a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one of the other ‘cliktivismi’ – the idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a receipt?
Global Citizen announces more than 19 million "made" on behalf of different goals since 2011.
These actions have encouraged policy makers to report commitments and principles corresponding to over 37 billion dollars, which have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than 10 billion dollars have already been used or collected.
The group estimates that the resources achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children to develop their full potential". The group committed itself to delivering $35 million to Rwanda to decide on malnutrition in the country. This happened after the activists sent them 4 700 TVs as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"With the help of the British government, donors, governments of different countries and people like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the history of history," said Power of Nutrition at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British Government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5,000 actions, and the government has made public to the Power project, which focuses on combating malnutrition, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions asked on the website of the movement is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's answer: "It's going to be long and difficult, and we've got a lot of compact stones ahead of us.
We will, however, succeed, such as major civil rights fighting and apartheid moves before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman plot a New York concert this year, and its star cards include artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Moonae.
According to the U.S. Department of Interior, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the Navy as a "pretext"
According to US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, the Washington Examier magazine, Washington can "when it is desired" to use its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including in the near future.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria — the invitation of the legal government — are an excuse to recognise the new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason for the presence of [Russia] in the Middle East is energy transfer, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," said Zinken.
According to the administrator, methods and means are available to prevent this.
"The United States have the ability to keep shipping routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, to ensure that the energy they offer does not reach the world market" he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers Union, which is a non-profit group profiled as an energy consumer sound tower in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approach to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it was about the same thing.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel by another," he says, and he describes Russia as "a circus number of one trick", whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements are due to a situation in which Trump's administration has tried to enhance the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace it with significantly cheaper Russian liquid natural gas.
In order to enhance this, President Trump's administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from Nord Stream 2, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to Moscow's farming youth.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transfer capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres of existing pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kreml claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier" says Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak, after meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude has caused a reaction in Germany, which has strengthened its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial roof organisation, the central industrial union of Germany, has called on the United States to remain separate from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The fact that the third state is involved in our energy supply," says Dieter Kempf, director of the Central Industrial Union of Germany, recently after the meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, is planning to carefully consider the status of "in the presidential elections in 2020"
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced that he would "be careful" would become a presidential candidate after the elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering an open questionnaire in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and correct our defective regime, and this also means a woman at the headquarters of the kingdom" he said, according to The Hill magazine.
"After the sixth day of November, I intend to give careful thought to becoming a presidential candidate."
Warren estimated, during the occasion of President Donald Trump's opportunity, that "he's taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," he says.
Warren has played a direct role in criticising Trump and the candidate for this highest court of justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In his receipt on Friday, Warren wrote, "that's why we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, according to the opinion published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's constituents do not support this setting in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk's policy research institute and the Boston Globe survey, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the status of the senator.
32% were in favour of becoming a candidate.
Of the respondents to the questionnaire, the former governor, Deval Patrick, supported the setting up of 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
For example, former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders will be present in other debates.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden has formally said that he has decided on his nomination by January.
Sarah Pali refers to her son's war rites at Donald Trump's election.
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq, entrenched in armed forces in September.
Track Pali was arrested on Monday night, and he was charged with domestic violence.
"What my son will have to go through when I return home can well identify other families who will face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers will carry home," he told the audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma at Donald Trump's election.
Palin called the arrest “the flow horse in the living room” and said his son, as did the rest of the war veterans, “to go home a little changed, they come back hard, they come back to think, whether he and his fellow army will respect what he and his fellow Air Force have done for the good of this land.”
Track Pali was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to the Wasilla police informant Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault against women, domestic violence and handling the weapon.
18 states and the Columbian alliances support the action against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbian alliances are seeking change to a new policy that came into force in the United States, where asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or family violence.
The 18 state and federal representatives have left a letter of justice friends on Friday in Washington.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions file, which American Civil Liberty Union raised in August against the federal policy.
He says that his partner, "and his sons in violent gangs," assaulted him, and the U.S. authorities denied him asylum on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The general prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, a large part of which are US asylum seekers as countries where gang and family violence are a problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the decision taken by the Asylum Appeal Board in 2014 that undocumented migrants could seek asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
In his statement on Friday, the General Prosecutor of the Columbia Alliance, Karl Racine, stated that the new line "will ignore the decades of state, federal and international law".
"The law of the Member State of origin requires all asylum applications to be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle" is stated in the letter of friends of the right.
In a letter, prosecutors also claim that practical measures to prevent asylum seekers from entering the US economy are damaging, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and that 'emergence the necessary additional labour'.
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions ordered judges dealing with immigration to suspend the granting of asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The place of refuge is meant for persons who flee from their country because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular class of society or because of persecution or fear of a political opinion", Sesions announced in its opinion on the new asylum practice of 11.6.
The asylum was never meant to solve all problems — even serious problems — that people face every day in the world.
Desperate rescue operations continue in the Palace – the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting more serious.
"Tilanne's very tight," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, when she calms down about her hot baby, Please, at the evacuation center in the ruined city.
"The ambulances will bring in a minute of new bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants burn to their destroyed homes, pick up their watertight goods and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the hospitals that have been damaged by 7.5 magnits are full.
Some injured people, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers fractures of the spine and shoulder, are resting outside the army hospital, where patients are treated for continuing, intense after-stamping.
His eyes are filled with tears in his orbit, how fierce the earthquake shaken the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
Harris tells Associated Press, and tells us that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then I got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The United States Ambassador blames China for 'provosing' by 'propaganda declarations'
The US Ambassador blames Beijing for using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, which takes place a week after the Chinese newspaper has published a four-page advertisement in the US newspaper, which praises the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the Annex to the Chinese Daily magazine Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper of the Iowa state, after accusing China of engaging in Congress elections held on 6.11.
According to the U.S. authorities, Trump's accusations of Beijing's companies involved in US elections mean a new phase in the Washington-wide campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for the foreign government to disseminate notifications in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-expanding trade war, in which both parties decide, on an alternate basis, to impose customs duties on the export products of the counterparty.
According to Chinese and American experts, Chinese vengeance tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, US Chinese Ambassador and long-term governor of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the United States' working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products in China.
China "is now accelerating its promotions by publishing propaganda reports in our own free press", wrote Branstad in his opinion document published on Sunday's Des Moines Register.
"The Chinese Government will benefit from the traditions of the United States of America's respected free word and press by making a payment to Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
"In the magazines of the streets of Peking, however, differing opinions are only seen in a limited manner, and real, different opinions, which the Chinese citizens may not have at all about the alarming development of their economy, due to the fact that the media is strictly in the youth of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad continues by saying that "one of the largest Chinese newspapers claimed to publish the offer" an article he wrote, but does not specify which paper it is about.
Kavanaugh fiasco deports female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republican leaders stand behind and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh may, according to analysts, give rise to a reaction, particularly in the forthcoming elections among female voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have been on the big tours, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to proceed with the vote.
"You can't cancel these things," says the professor of state school, Grant Reeher, from the Maxwell Institute of Syracuse, University of Syracuse, in an article published on Saturday in The Hill magazine.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona) last minute's offer of an angry voter for an FBI investigation.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and the informant of the National Reform Group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper in the capital city.
On Friday morning, protestors sang "Marraskull is coming" in demonstrating their opinion in the Senate's committees when deciding on the ruling Republicans in the Committee on Legal Affairs to proceed to Kavanaugh's appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blassey Ford's statement of testimony, Mickey reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable," says Stu Rothenberg, a non-binding political analyst at an interview on the news site.
People say that enthusiasm has been high, and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the female voters and the younger voters in the neighbouring countries, those aged 18-29, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts predict a possible counter-response if the Republicans proceed with confirmation even before Ford's statement of testimony against the candidate for the Supreme Court, in which he claimed sexual harassment.
"This is going to be a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee president of NBC News Channel at the beginning of last week.
"This is not just the vote of the Committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is being put to question, and it is about how the Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with Ford", Guy Cecil, the president of the U.S. Group of Democrats, commented on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in whether they should believe in Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony as the latter tends to a small majority.
According to a new opinion report by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe that Ford's witness statement is absolutely or likely, whereas 35% say they believe it absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh was likely or absolutely lying in his witness statement, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
As Flake press ahead, the FBI is investigating charges against Ford and at least one of the others, presented by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford proved before the judicial committee that Kavanaugh was embezzling him while he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court had revealed to him at the student party of his family body while studying at the University of Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web explorer plans to launch a new Internet as a counter-intelligence for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the explorer of World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Open Source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data are stored and who has access to any information.
In the interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee is joking about Inrupt's aim of "control of the world".
"It must be done now," he said, referring to his startup company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data storage", i.e. POD.
It may include contact information lists, memory lists, calendars, music books and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
In a personal data warehouse, it is unique to have full user access to any type of data.
The company calls it "to be personalised through information".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to give the resources, processes and the required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes a safety platform purchased by Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM, a community of hired developers working with the project and volunteers.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website. This is all available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change where all of their business models will be translated into their heads together at night".
"We will not ask their consent to the matter."
In the article he published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote in Inrupt's mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new Solid network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee modelled the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the last few months, the Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, also after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priests of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest who has been rewarded by Victoria Cross of England, a military minister since the 100th anniversary.
The military medal was awarded to the Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann on 29.9.1918 as a result of the attacks on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, the jury was created four days later without ever knowing that he was given the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandkids were about to reveal the monument at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, says the event is "sympathetic"; the monument was revealed to a level of 100 years after his rewarded grandfather's urification.
According to the London Galetts 29 9,1918 Colonel Vann led his Battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under the fire of heavy shields and machine guns."
Later, he hit the front line, and "the biggest bravery in the world" led the troops to move ahead before their raids alone to the field girl. In the next fight, Vann had his own hands cast down three cannon batteries.
Colonel Vann was created on 4 October 18th – only a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was something I could never achieve, something that arouses respect.

Free-to-air friends waited all night for Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel showed Pipsa Possu
Imagine the situation where you have been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament and not to present the whole event.
There were 13 games in the San José event program, six of which were scheduled for the main series of games, and the show was to be presented as a live broadcast in Britain on Channel 5.
Six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mouse and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring of the program, Pipsa Possuu's viewers became a big push.
Some viewers were not really happy with their oversight over the whole night’s match.
One friend of the free match opened up on Twitter describing the replacement of the match with children's cartooned "a sick joke of some kind".
According to the Act, this content was not suitable to be presented at 6 a.m., so they had to change it to their children's programme" explained Dave Schwartz, the senior marketing and communication director of Bellator's programme.
"Pipsa Possu, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator Company, said that timetables will be worked so that British viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a re-delivery that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
"But the ban will be six in the morning, and we will not be allowed to present the program before Sunday for our time, which, in turn, will be Mondays for their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program shifted into their heads, messages began to travel in direction and to the other, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to correct the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you, next time this won't happen.
We're trying to offer our fans more and we tried too hard.
This is a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
A swim jumper and an Olympic athlete Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to all others because of his sexuality, yet this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that he's only noticed when he comes to high school that "all aren't the same as me".
Lauren Laverne, speaking on the radio channel 4 in the Desert Island Discs program, has told us that she had spoken about gay rights to give others a 'storage'.
He also tells us how winning at the Olympics was no longer so important after having a child.
The long-term radio programme is a regular drunk, Kristy Young, who has taken several months off due to illness.
As a guest in Laverne's first program, Daley told me that he felt younger than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work".
He says: "To this day these feelings, to feel less and different have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy that I have needed to succeed."
He says he wanted to show himself to be ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality eventually became revealed.
The double Olympic Prossidismist has become a high profile LGBT activist, and he is present in the races this year appealing to criminalise homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to live freely without consequences, and he wanted to give “the hope” to other people.
Three times the world champion tells of his love for a man — the American film maker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — as a surprise.
Daley got married to this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things so much when you're so young" – he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – "it's hard to find another age of the same age that would have been the same for you," Daley says.
The couple received the boy in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – which led to the "size perspective" of Daley.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been round about winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie's my Olympic gold medal."
His son got his name according to Daley's father, who died in 2011 only when he was 40 years old.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley about were the Olympic tickets for 2012 and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell her she wasn't gonna be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breath stopped. Only after the breath had indeed stopped and she had died, I finally realized that she was not vulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was something I've dreamed of all my life – jump in front of the home audience at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first song - Heather Skéll's "Proud" – a song that raised feelings when he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin on chicken.
Desert Island Discs is sent to the BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
On Saturday at Ryder Cup, a four-way Mickelson.
Phil Mickelson, U.S.A., violates the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to play hard to avoid the record round as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays at the event to be played every two years for the 12th time, moved to the exchange bench by Captain Jim Furyk to play during the fourball and foursom on Saturday.
In general, the American five-time Major tournament winner, which is the center of attention, has spent half of the day trying to get his punch on the field as a cheerleader and the other half.
A 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even held on top of his career as one of the most accurate drivers, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-growing fur is punishing inaccurate punches.
If there is not enough opposition to Mickelson in the field itself, the 9th game on Sunday is the famous British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who is playing together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to plant all four victory tubes this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind 12 doubles get a flying departure, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but what else could be said in a situation like this.
"He fully understands the role in which he played today. He killed me in the back, he rustled and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the best players without dispute and has brought so much of his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but I saw this go and we ended up in a solution like this.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson violates Nick Faldon's record of more played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 profits, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to be at the expense of people, and he's a funny guy with whom everyone likes," he explains.
"The younger players must have had fun with him this week. It's gotta be fun to watch.
He's bringing as much money into the team as he's just doing in the game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows how long leadership can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, is aware of the experience that the last day of the double game can come from Ryder Cup's measuring leadership.
In 1997, the Danish player made his debut in Valderram, where Sive Ballesteros was led by five points in comparison with the American, but who was able to win the winner with the rock lines just and just as much as his nose and won at the narrowest margin (1411⁄2-1311⁄2).
"It reminds me of how we led a hole in Valderram, we were holed up in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderram, although scarcely", said Bjorn, after looking at the 5–3 winners of the 2018 team, both on Friday and yesterday, moving to 10–6 lines on Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot you with a big calibre.
We'll go to the airport and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we're trying to win that prize, and that's all we're trying to do.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side. However, we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world."
I'm glad that his team players have made a difficult field, so Bjorn adds: "I'll never be licked before you drop in such matters.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow there will be a priority for individual performances, and then we will talk about different issues.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player's capacity is tested on the ground.
This is a message that needs to be sent to players – tomorrow everyone can do the best.
Now we have to give up on a partner who can go to the field by himself and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite captain Jim Furyk will be required to perform better as individuals than they were able to partner for. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last day's full turn in both directions. He was involved in a winning team in Brookline before he ended up as a loser when the European team won "the miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word of evil," he answered the question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team handed out the lines of his team to the last day's experiments.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When you get this going in one direction, you get a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have set our composition accordingly and put the boys on the field in the way we want them to, as you know, we're going to perform miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead a defense struggle and he meets Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next to meet their European opponents.
"I put the team's guys in this order because I think it'll be through the tournament," Bjorn commented on his double-game choices.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The German fleet's latest ferret should have been introduced in 2014 with the aim of replacing the obsolete cold war equipment, but it should be introduced early next year due to the faultous systems and explosively increasing costs, reporting local media.
According to the military notifier for Die Zeit ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the first vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg fregette class has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after-delivery problems have persecuted the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen class ferrets.
According to the information available, they are equipped with efficient cannons, missile systems for the prevention of aircraft and surface vessels and troubleshooting technologies, such as radar reflectivity, and infrared and acoustic signals, which reduce the detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The essential characteristics of the ship also include its longer service range – the new fregats should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the warships representing the top of the technology, which are said to be aimed at improving German influence in the overseas regions, are already obsolete at the time they enter the service, the Die Zeit newspaper points out.
Last year, the poor F125 ferret ended up in headlines when the German fleet officially refused to take up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the fleet returns the ship after its delivery.
There is little knowledge of the causes of the return, but the German media has spoken of the essential "software and equipment charts" that make the warship fit for battle tasks.
Software benefits are of particular importance because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class is approximately 120, which is only half of the older Bremen class ferrets.
It also appeared that the vessel is of considerable overweight weight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s potential for subsequent updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, with a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the corresponding class used in the Second World War in Germany.
In addition to defective equipment, the entire project price tag is also a problem.
The price is estimated at EUR 3.1 billion when the initial price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of access to new ferrets have emerged when the German maritime authorities have recently warned that it will shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the German Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's "usable vessels" are at a low level.
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been removed, but no new ones have been submitted to them.
He complained about the fact that no fregat of the Baden-Württemberg class could be deployed in the Navy.
The environmental organisation is listening to the secret life of bats
A new survey is carried out in the upper Scotland area to find out how bats use land when hunting for food.
New research is expected to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide them in future protection measures.
The research carried out by the National Trust for Scotland scientists monitors sickle and midwives, as well as earbrows and water wings in the Inverewe Garden area of the plant garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage equipment is placed on the main points of the region in order to monitor the operations of bats during the season.
The personnel and volunteers of the organisation shall also carry out mobile measurements using monitoring equipment.
The frequency of sounds and the species concerned shall be ensured by an analysis of experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report is being created where the behaviour of the sheets can be presented in an image of the scale of the region.
Rob Dewar, the Organization's Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for lepers, and how different species use them.
The information will help with the design of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and associated species.
In Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom, lepo populations have fallen significantly over the past hundred years.
Building and construction work threaten the resting and living environments of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as fly paper and certain chemicals used in construction materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of common hunting practices, their ears are more useful in catching prey than in eyes.
The bats use advanced oscillating techniques to detect insects and obstructions on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation for the protection of the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares across the country – and they take leprosy seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of resting places, and, in some cases, rescue measures for animals.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only a protected area for the protection of leprosy in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the 10 bat oils are found in Scotland.
According to farmkeeper David Thompson, the area is ideal for rest.
"Threve is very good for lepers," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and a good environment in general.
We do not know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to understand better what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of reviewing the buildings for the rest of the houses before taking up the collections, because the destruction of a place of rest on one of the sheets can deliberately cause up to 400 female and male deaths and destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and the killing, interference or destruction of their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish civil servant of the LP, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo challenges rape charges while lawyers are preparing a case against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has pointed out the rape charges against him as "residual" and says people want to "explain themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken up claims to sue the official German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel in Vienna in 2009.
His claim to have paid the victim $375 000 for silence, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
On Instagram, Ronaldo showed 142 million followers only hours after the argument was made. A 33-year-old football player strongly rejected the accusations and described them as "removable".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, false news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," the player kept smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations that they have called the Reuters News Office "an unfit report on the suspicions of privacy".
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, says that the player requires compensation "for the suffering of the person according to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case is said to have taken place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have met at the nightclub and moved to the player's room, where he claims to have raped this anally, according to the papers sent to Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said he was a 99 percent good guy, but one percent disappointed.
According to the documentation, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple of people having sex, but it was about mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he was in the police station and that he had taken photos of his injuries at the hospital, but later he ended up in a conciliation settlement because he had "the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that he would "be subject to public humiliation".
34-year-olds now say that they are applying for the annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to moving to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault on Manchester United, and moved to the Italian gymnastic team by means of a $100 million contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom should “be sorry forever” about the end of car manufacturing
The UK would "be gone forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he would like to see the entry of the Danube UK unit suspended temporarily production in his factory near Derby, Burma, if Britain were to exit the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of the restrictions will be felt as job losses if a brex is reached without an agreement.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures the Tokyo Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year. Ninety percent of them were exported to the European Union.
"It is my understanding that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will be interrupted," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Danube Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about the exit from the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its factory for a month when Brex is implemented.
The main concern is that the car manufacturers report that the risks associated with the supply chain in the implementation of the contractual Brexit.
The Tokyo production line is rounded up with the timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and cars are manufactured from the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can cause disturbances at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages.
It is impossible to keep an extra-day storage at Derbyshire factory, according to Tokyo, and production would be cut off.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "a completely calibrated plan to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement; we want the best possible agreement, which not only represents success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we need to make good use of", he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"It is not only Mr Toby, but also the statements from other manufacturers that we must definitely be able to continue the ranges of very well-functioned supply chains so far."
Toyota cannot tell us how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would be to reduce the competitiveness of the installation and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and acts as a trade union agent at the factory, says that there is concern among the growing members: "There will never be a return to jobs lost in my experience.
The government informant says: "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting with Mr. Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House will announce.
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can be "going to move yet another week" due to the duty of Brettt Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Mr. Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who, in turn, investigates Russia's involvement in elections, links of Trump's assistants to Russia and any action by the President to prevent justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months about Trump's intention to dismiss the Deputy Justice Minister, which would jeopardise the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported to Rosenstein’s rapporteurs about the possibility of secret recording discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of rescinding President on the basis of Appendix 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Mr. Rosenstein has contested the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to tell us that Rosenstein had resigned.
However, President Trump was at that time visiting the United Nations in New York, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "not prefer to" Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its time was brought together with the hearing of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blassey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump imposed a week-long investigation against Kavanaugh by the FBI concerning claims, which further postponed the vote of the Senate plenary session.
Trump's press chief Sarah Sanders was in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "There is no daily amount set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for all the rest of the week due to what is happening in the Supreme Court at the moment.
But I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Newsman Chris Wallace asked for a reason.
Sanders says that the cause of the crisis in press events is due to other reasons than the resistance to the 'discussion' of TV suppliers, but he said: 'I do not deny the fact that they are being obsessive.'
However, Sanders understood the coming increase in direct contacts between Trump and the press.
"The President keeps more surveys than any president before him," he says, and he adds more evidence to the strategy book: "We've checked those numbers."
"The press conference will continue to be organised", Sanders said, but "it is extremely much better if the media has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We are often trying to do this, and you have seen us act this way several times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences with those who visit.
The presentation alone at the press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the president showed possible reasons for this when there was an unhindered time and time strangely present for journalists.
Minister of Health wrote a letter on the fears for workers of the Scottish Public Health System (NSH Scotland) from EU countries regarding Brex
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the health care workers from the EU countries in Scotland to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after the Brex.
Mr Jeane Freeman of Scotland sent a letter when the UK resigns from the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the differences between Britain and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible difference.
I know that for all of you, these are uncertain times.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we appreciate the contribution of every employee of ours to citizenship without looking at citizenship.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers team's sponsor, Christio Abercrombie, has been in an emergency operation since the team had disappeared on Saturday 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports to Tennessea's editor Mike Organ.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He came to the sidebar and simply got down to it," Reed says.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him in pairs and took him to the side for a more specific assessment.
Tennessee State editor told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has had surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/width of abuse at this stage", and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays the first in the team after she moved from Illinois.
He had five tablets on Saturday before he left the game, making a total of 18 tablets this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when purchasing real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when purchasing properties in Great Britain. Additional money will be used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The purpose of this amendment is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters.
Raising bread tax on those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year — helping homeless people
Theresa May is coming to inform foreign buyers of the higher level of stamp tax on their purchases of properties in Great Britain. The extra money is used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper housing and has paid attention to good income taxation.
The increase in bread tax is targeted at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to Great Britain, and the extra money from it will be directed to government measures to help the suffering of homeless people.
The additional levy, which will be added to the current stamp tax two years ago, in addition to the addition of the second dwelling and investment dwelling increases, may be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to GBP 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's new buildings are purchased by residents other than the United Kingdom, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-hand buyers to buy on the property market.
Many wealthy areas in Great Britain, especially its capital, have become ‘a city’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will only come weeks after Boris Johnson presented a way to reduce the stamp tax to facilitate the purchase of young people's first dwellings.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to reject favourable housing quotas for the correction of the United Kingdom's 's disgraceful situation'.
Corby has announced a series of proposals for reforming housing markets, including the restrictions on mountains and the end of "secure weddings".
He would also like to give delegations more power in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year that I intend to own my Prime Minister's dream – that every generation's life should be better than its predecessor – to return.
This means fixing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that persons who do not live in Great Britain, as well as companies abroad, can buy housing as easily as hard British residents.
Too many people have become far too distant to have a home, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
The Underland leader Jack Ross says his "basic goal" is to become a manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old sister is enthusiastic about her challenge to raise the country's domestic corner back to her legs. The team is now in third place in the UK's second division.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to Scotland's Electoral League for the last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play in my country's team.
I got into team two and it was there", Ross says at the BBC: Scotland's Sports Sound.
"When I was a child, I often watched my father and his Scottish games at the Hampden, and that's something that has always dragged me back.
This opportunity will only be met if I succeed as a company manager".
Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about the entry into his designated predecessors' boots in the named company, and he has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"In this moment, I'm measuring my own success with whether I can restore this company to an instrument.
Based on the structure and ability of the Society, it is undoubtedly part of the elector", he says.
"That's where it's not easy, but I probably think I'm a success only if I can trust the team back in the dialing game."
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years: first as the Deputy Director of the Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heat Coach Group.
After this, he helped Allo to rise from the three-series crash games and raised St Mirreen from the fall to the masters during the next season.
Ross says he's feeling better now than ever during his career as a player in Clyden, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"I was probably in a real road trip with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to Alloa.
"I truly believed I was better suited as a manager than a player.
That sounds strange because I played well, I made moderate good money, and I enjoyed some relatively great successes.
But playing can be hard.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but running the team seems just the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for my job, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever been in my adult life".
The whole interview is to be heard at Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, at Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the pint is on Saturday at 17.30 a.m., the study shows
The summer heat wave has fired the pubs that are struggling with the difficulties of Britain, but at the same time increased pressure on the food chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but the outputs of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures from Peter Martin's business consultant CGA says: "The continuing solar weather and the expected longer participation in football World Championships meant that the sales of pubs such as June were 2.8% higher, while the month was even worse.
The fall of 1.8% in the sale of restaurants only deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinks were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the fall in the sales of restaurants.
The concentrated pubs in the dining room also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than those in restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted out drinking in their minds.
The sale of pubs and bar drinks by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and there was a 3% decrease in food sales."
Paul Newman from the RSM company that provides consultancy services in the free time and hotel sector says: "The results will continue with the trend which has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sales of non-home nutrition markets.
It is no surprise that the fight against the food chains will continue, although the fall in annual sales of 4.8% will start particularly now that the sector is currently struggling with cost pressure.
A long hot summer could not have come to a worse harvest for food-focused operators, and it is only time to show if the lively colder temperatures in the area are brought into a breathing state that is urgently needed.
In July, the combined increase in sales, including new open restaurants, was 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.

Fifth of children secretly secret social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of children — some of whom up to 11 – secretly social media accounts from their parents and teachers, research reports
A study of 20 000 upper secondary school students revealed an increasing phenomenon of ‘Instagram feikkitilien’
The news raised the concern that the accounts can be shared with sexual intelligence content.
20% of students reported having a ‘head account’ to be shown to parents
A fifth of children, some of whom are even 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 upper secondary schools revealed the rapid increase in the existence of ‘Instagram's feikkitiles’, which refers to the Instagram site for the distribution of images.
The news has raised fears that the accounts can publish sexual content.
20% of students told them they would keep the cleaned ‘head account’ for parents to show while using other private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager, in which she hoped to be raped, after contacting her 13 - year - old daughter on a secret site.
In a study carried out by the Digital Academy UK and the Rtoorian Advisory Board (HMC), 40 percent of young people aged 11-18 kept two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted that they would keep secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel attracted to the creation of network spaces, from which parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle "The voice of athletes" for Scottish athletes' government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish government of athletes as a non-executive member of the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most awarded general athlete in Scotland. Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the name as a fine opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit during the last decade of the athlete’s collection of extensive experience at international level.
"Eilidhi is highly respected among athletes in Scotland, Great Britain and internationally. I am sure that Scotland's athletes will benefit enormously from his appointment to the government", says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I look forward to my role as a sportsman's sound horn and I hope that I can be of benefit and help to guide Scotland's sport in the right direction."
Four Olympic Games won by an American athlete who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the Olympic Atlanta in 1996, and who is now acting as a regular commentator at the BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of a passing brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I got a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say it's only time to show, recover and what to do.
This has been a exhausting work, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I'm working on agileness!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advertising similar to mothers cows share opinions online
The advertising similar to the dairy cows in the company that makes breast pumps has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has introduced a product called "the world's first silence and a breast pump on top of it". Its marketing is accelerated by an advertising made in the cheek and adapted to the style of music videos, which describes the freedom of the new pump for breast-feeding mothers.
Four mothers of real life danced in the barn filling up their tribes, among other things, by saying, "Yes, I milk myself, but no sign of him" and "If you didn't happen to notice, they're not weird, they're titties."
The beam goes on to say, "Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my bread."
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page gave rise to a discussion online.
77 000 watching and hundreds of comments collected have raised conflicting reactions in viewers. Many people say it is doing it to spoil the daily ‘rare’ of the dairy industry.
"The use of materials in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk; however, their babies are stolen from them shortly after giving birth," a commentator writes.
Elvie breast pump is very good for breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another viewer commented: "It is clearly traumatized for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they use them to promote breast pump to mothers who can keep their babies?"
The third commentator added: "A complete reality-based advertisement."
Adinos also received defenders: a woman admitted that the advertising was in her opinion "humane".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I were still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product", reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun advertisement directed at mothers who pump (in most workplaces or toilets) and "I feel like cows".
The purpose of the advertising is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the commercial, video women reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps in their bras closed.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, there are no wires and hoses and it is obviously suitable for breast-feeding, which gives women the freedom to move, hold on to the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office commented: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned bold and provocative entry into the market.
By raising the nursing mothers and milkmen, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump to the spotlight, we brought the feeling of incredible freedom brought by the new pump in an inspiring and similar way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
In London’s fashions, two children’s mothers appeared in Catwalk in designer Marta Jakubowski’s costume using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on Texas border in every silence
Even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, the number of children who have been involved has increased sharply, due to the fact that the rough rhetoric and policies that have been introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in foster families.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of paperless migrants, and registration as a foster family may jeopardise their own residence in the country.
The risk grew in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy must give their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, proved last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"In addition to 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households, the country is illegal, and a large proportion of them are criminals from abroad.
So we keep looking for these people," Albence says.
In order to tackle children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the matter must be dealt with at the court within a month of the date of the date of the arrest instead of the 60-day limit previously used, the employees of the reception centre will report.
Many are more likely to appear through videoconferencing than personally in the courts dealing with immigrants.
Those who are not considered to be entitled to help will be quickly expelled.
According to the staff of reception centres and the reports published over the past few months, the time spent in custody of children will affect whether children will begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent decommissions or forced-run companies.
According to lawyers, concerns are particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child’s despair may be missed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and many children already suffer from trauma.
Syria orders the United States, France and Turkey to "develop" immediately.
During the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moualem, who is also a substitute for the Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are in the country illegally using the excuse for fighting terrorism, and that "with them they will act accordingly".
"We must withdraw immediately and unconditional", he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the war against terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where over 360 000 people died in 2011 and beyond, and that millions of people had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "sounding fight until all Syria has been cleaned" of both terrorist organisations and "unlawful foreign troops".
The United States has around 2 000 soldiers located in Syria, where they are mostly training and guiding Kurds and Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested battles to tear over 1,000 soldiers into the ground.
On the refugee question, Moualem said that the circumstances were good for the return and accused "some Western countries" of "distribution" of irrational fears, which encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have called on the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these refunds," he said.
"They are politicising something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted reconstruction aid until the war has ended by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer area in the last rebel base in Idlib has created the opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian Syrian forces in the area of three million people.
Moualem has, however, stressed that the agreement has clear time limits and expressed the hope that military action, including Al-Qaida, would be targeted by al-Quadan-related Al-Nusra-Eysra fighters, "to be destroyed".
The United Nations Ambassador Staffa de Mistura hopes that it will soon be able to invite the first meetings of the new government and the opposition committee to create and balance the way for elections to create a post-war Constitution for Syria.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "reviewing the pillars of the current Constitution" and warned him not to interfere.
Why Trump Be Selected For the Second season
According to this logic, President Trump would win the elections for 2020 unless, as many liberals will likely wish, post office and scandal decide early on his term of office.
This would no doubt be "a dramatic Presidency decision ever!"
No signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers so far.
Since 2014, the highest number of viewing hours has doubled by CNN to 1,05 million and almost tripled by the 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Fox News, on average, there are 2.4 million viewers in the best viewing time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has access to the cable TV: the top readings of 3.5 million viewers are the most important news sites.
"This is the grass that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Baer, the principal producer of the ABC Designated Survivor programme, says of the Minister, who will be president of the Congress building destroyed by the attack.
Nell Scovelll, who has experienced the comedy writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneating Into the Hollywood Boys' Club author, is another theory.
He remembers the taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
There's some entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike other TV programs, news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade is doing, whether members of immigrant families get to each other and how the world economy can.
Inadmissibility is luxury which only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the responsibilities of the conscious citizen to consider a six-hour panel of experts arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's source records for Fear, as well as the consequences of the unparalleled descriptions of Paul Manafort's 15 000 dollar struts (Washington Post said, "sound clothing") and Stormy Daniels' President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I will never again be able to look at Super Marion the same way I used to.
"What he's doing seems like a true-tv program, because it's partly about giving the audience something every night," says Wheelhouse Entertainment's leader and the creator of the Pantilainaamo series, Brent Montgomery Trump's show, about changing people and changing daily plots (NFL, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't miss a episode or fall off a cart.
When I reached out to Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a wonderful sunny day on the far north coast, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while he was nailing CNN.
He couldn't get rid of the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing all those crazy programs and people saying it was the beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

From the outside, money flows to tight snacks
It is not surprising that the 17th election district in Pennsylvania has faced a real flow of money, because, as a result of the reorganization of the congressional elections, two candidates already elected will have to fight in one place.
This recently resettled Pitsburg electoral district is a challenge for the Conor Lamb of Democrats, who got the place from the second electoral district in last spring's special elections.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Keith Rothfus of the Republicans, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is overlapping with the new 17th district.
The regional division was re-introduced after the highest court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old electoral division was favoured by Republicans against the Constitution.
Competition has been launched in the financial sections of the main parties in the new 17th round in the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRC).
The name of the Lamb came to be known after the special elections of the 18th Congress district in Pennsylvania.
The place had been with the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won in the region by 20%.
Political commentators have made a fine headway for the Democrats.
The United States has planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retreated from its intentions
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already listed the situation in Beijing and the mild reaction to Washington.
President Trump had a warm-up meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organisation Group's management team.
The officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to invite the American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the "slow lines that will no longer be recognised by Taiwan", said Head of Department Heather Nauert in his opinion earlier this month.
However, penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars of aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, and development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been a painful attack on the Central American State with a high level of unemployment and death crimes.
As internal meetings progress, the North and Central American authorities postponed the high level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity, a similar meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in companies to prevent migrants from trying to reach the United States.
In mid-September, however, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was wanted to proceed, and this effectively decided on speculation on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
The Vice-President, Mike Pence, is now expected to give a signal to the mid-October meeting on the importance of the administration for the meeting, the diplomats stated.
These three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new bad messages or penalties from Washington.
The journalist of the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal matters with anonymism.
Their report confirmed an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the protection of anonymity.
History teaches
The next inevitable step could be the report by Special Envoy Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of President Trump's right, which is now very heavy evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported as a progressive investigation of whether Trump’s campaign was secretly involved in Russia when Russia was involved in US elections.
If the power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to him just as he is preparing to go before his voters again and may be condemned to his likeness.
There are a lot of dissents here, and I'm not saying that President Trump's loss would be inevitable, no more than the loss of the likes in Europe.
We must resolve both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been ready to throw up Hitler's power if the West had also opposed him and supported the cheques in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years that followed the massacre.
The course of history goes to such turning points where the untapped march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Mr Rosenstein has been charred since the announcement that he had proposed to record the secret president's speech and considered the President's potential inability to handle his mission.
According to Rosenstein, the Times's report is a mistake.
"How do we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanugh's operation is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed by credible claims made in spite of the Supreme Court's membership of sexual harassment and dishonest witnessing?
And above all, are we voting in the arbitration panel, which considers President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these things, our democracy will be in the long and dark winter.
But I believe that our success in Prague is due to my lesson.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, and she was expelled from Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomat bag.
He made it, moved as a settler to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that desk that was cleaned up by the swan.

Graham Dorrans, Rangers as optimistic for the meeting in Vienna
The Rangers will meet at their home on Thursday at Rapid Viunta, knowing that after a tie against Villarreal in Spain earlier in the same month, the victory from the Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter the G block of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before Villarreal 2-2-game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a boost board for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer", a 31-year-old player states.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring us a point.
Perhaps we could have been able to catch the victory at the end, but overall, the tie is probably a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half of the year, and we got on the other and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it's gonna be a tough game, because their outcome was good in the last game. However, I believe that with the support of this group, we can give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard about becoming my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy it; the workouts are smooth.
I hope we can now press full, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings leads women to sleep
Although the research participants had a clear vision of how they wished to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the international survey reported that they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said that they had spoken with their children.
"The people want family members to take care of them, but they don't make a point," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell us your wishes in time.
Discuss with the professional and family about where and how to obtain assistance, as these issues are an important cost-effective factor.
Take financial advice into discussion: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or personalised insurance, if you can afford.
Download legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative in place so that you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you cannot communicate with them.
Consider also drawing up a proxy for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine the person you trust to take care of your financial decisions for you and to ensure that your invoices are paid if you cannot take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a health emergency.

Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a violent earthquake and tsunamis that hit the city in Indonesia on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to grow.
As communication links to the region are cross-border, rescue authorities have not received any information about the region of Donggala, which is closer to the area of the 7.5 Magnit earthquake area.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about the Palace and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
The request is the central capital of the Sulawes province, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and the tsunami hit the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the north coastline of the Sulawes island.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under province, with an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main industries of the central Sulawes province and, in particular, the Donggala coastal region.
The quarrying of nickel is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowall on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Paluu and Donggala have struck several tsunamis over the past hundred years.
In 1938, tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in an active Pacific Ring of Fire area and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia, was caused by the tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island in Sumara Coastal Waters.
2006: 6.8 Magnitized earthquake struck Indonesia's most vulnerable island, Java, south by causing the tsunami that struck the island's southern coast by killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 Magnitized shock struck the city of Padang, the capital city of the province of Western Sudan.
More than 100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 Magnitized earthquake struck one of the islands of Sumatran Mentawai, causing a ten-metre high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: The superficial shock struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya region, causing destruction and panic in people's memory of the huge damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There were no tsunamis this time, but more than a hundred people died in the fall of the buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
The oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and Vice-President, Track Palin, has been arrested for assault.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaskan police, Palin from Alaska Wasilla, 29, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence and the prevention and opposition of domestic violence in connection with arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone from his female partner when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Research Centre and the guaranteed amount is $500, report on the TV channel to the U.S.A.
According to the report, Pali came to court on Saturday and replied, "fully innocent".
Palin is accused of three class A offences, which means that he may receive a maximum of one year's imprisonment and $250,000 in fines.
He is also accused of a class B violation that can be sentenced to a day of imprisonment and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time I've ever been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assault by his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palini's mother called the police and reported assault.
The case is currently under way in Alaska's veteran right.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving the possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
I used to ask my girlfriend to blame Palin for hitting her face.
Veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 for combining her son with the traumatized stress disorder of violent behaviour caused by the service performed in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 Magnitized powers caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are cross-border and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta right outside the middle of Sulawes.
In the social media, the video is surrounded by a sudden moment.
Hundreds of people had met at the beach festival in Please, when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering putting a rare death penalty on the suspect in the NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for the suspect of eight terrorist attacks in New York City, a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state since the federal crime since 1953.
According to the charge of Saipov, 30, Home Depot's rental car was used in a October attack on the West Side Highway, south of Manhattan, where he drove on pedestrians and bikers.
According to the report on the application for the death penalty in the southern district of New York, the death penalty would be possible if the prosecutors were able to prove that Saipov killed eight victims of his " purposefully" and caused " purposefully" serious physical injuries.
According to the case-law, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both charges.
A few weeks after the attack, federal law imposed a criminal charge on Saipov 22 against eight murders to assist the terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal title in cases of organised crime, and the charges included violence and the destruction of motor vehicles;
The attack required "admirable design and preparation", the prosecutors stated and described the way Saipov carried out his action as "creating, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", reported in the statement of charges.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
As of the previous year, when the right of the southern district of New York to give a death sentence has passed for a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty has been implemented in New York in the case of the federal state in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed on a conspiracy for spying on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the case-law, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of regret during the days and months following the attack.
He told the scientists what he did was good, the police told him.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by his attacks after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He replied to a 22-point charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipovian federal defense attorneys said that the defense was "naturally disappointed" in the decision of the prosecutor.
"In our view, it is our decision to demand the death penalty, not recognition and life expectancy without the possibility of liberation, is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to the parties," Patton said.
The protection of the Saipov had previously requested that he not be required to be sentenced to death.
The conservative parliamentarian says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable during the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in a protest against the conservatives "demobilize the civil army."
The former Director-General of Ukip said that politicians must know the emphasis of the Eurosceptics - when one of the Members of the Parliament of Theresa May proposed that he be led by negotiations with the EU.
To the marchers in Birmingham, the conservatives’ line representative, Peter Bone, stated that the United Kingdom would "be outside by now" if Farage were to be a brex secretary.
But May encounters the avoidance of deeply divided lines by adapting to the challenge posed by the conservatives with the support of the ice, which joined a distinct protest against the brex in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers-Compromise proposal on the surface of the Brex supporters and opponents, as well as in the EU's repression.
The beneficiaries call on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposals and the chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave in Solihull, that she wanted to "go on the Chequers proposal".
He proposed that Farage be included and that it should be held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Mr Wellingborough's parliamentary representative added: 'I am in favour of brex, but we must get rid of the Chequers proposal'.
He said his EU response: "We did not war against the world war to end up being subject.
We want to legislate our own laws in our own country."
Bone called on the public opinion to change after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay is a completely wrong argument."
The conservative brexist, Andrea Jenkyns, also attended the march and said to the editors: "I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be supported by members of the party or by activists who really go to the streets and are primarily responsible for our success.
Stop the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In his message to May, he added: "The prime ministers can keep their work while they keep their promise."
Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they intend to lose sight of the 2016 referendum decision.
It is now about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit, and we're here today telling them that we don't accept it."
When he spoke to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to go to Brex, to feel pressure from you."
"We will mobilise an army of citizens of this country, which gave us victory in the Brex vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governance and proud state."
Meanwhile, supporters marched through Birmingham before a two - hour event held in the city centre.
A small number of activists were added to "Tories Again Brexit." A group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked conservatives about safety problems, which they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say that they have IT systems in order to clean up and make all the technology for Canada plus plus plus, and that the uncomplicated border functions for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no good brex," he added.
Warren is seriously considering presidential presidency
American senator Elizabeth Warren says that he is seriously considering presidential candidate after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the massachusetsian democracy spoke of its future at the city hall at the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will be met in November by Geoff Diehl, a joint president of the campaign of the Republicans, Trump for 2016.
Warren is thought to be in a possible position against Trump in the elections of 2020.
Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th town meeting with voters since the beginning of the Trump season.

Arrest in the event of the shooting of LSU Sims
On Saturday, the Louisiana Baton Rouge police reported arresting a person suspected of shooting at LSU's basketball team player Wayde Sims' death on Friday.
Baton Rouge police reported Dyteon Simpson, 20 arrests at 11 a.m. on the E.T.P.
The police had released a video on Friday's shooting incident and asked for help to identify the man there.
Sims, 20, near Southern University campus, was shot early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted he was there during the interrogations, holding a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't do the resistance while he was arrested and he was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 in the last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 records per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after team arrangements offered him victory over Sebastian Veteltel
When Valteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that Mercedes' team arrangements were an important part of the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost his own fortune in defending his place in the first two rounds calling Vetelt’s teammate.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton driving a bunch of tails that should have resolved the situation.
Mercedes went round later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton passed a bit of contact and after the Ferrari driver shifted from the inner line to abandon his defence after two third translations.
Max Verstappe, who had spent his 21st birthday, started out from the trunks and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of competition while extending the switch of tyres to a rapid stop and to take the fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the shadow in the 44th round, but could not speed up the remaining eight rounds while taking the fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtter did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me by.
The team has made an exceptional career to achieve a double victory," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not leak into the public letter by Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment by the Supreme Court candidate.
When speaking on the occasion in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, but said that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of human "sufficientness, malice and dishonestity".
"The one thing that is possible, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for a few days, when we see a rage, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest," the President said.
"When we see publications and years of things, and then they say "yes, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, do you have this information for years?
Do you remember his reply...are you years of document - oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed.'
Wait a minute.
Our years we...no, we didn't leak," he added the senator to the fence.
In July Feinstein received a letter describing the charges against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was released in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein said to the committee after The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban did not apply to the President who commented on the matter on Saturday’s occasion: “I tell you that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I ever saw from the body tongue."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual harassment and thought that the charges used by the Democrats would be of their own benefit.
"They have decided to regain power by any means necessary.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to gain power and control," Mediate reports that the president has said.

He died later in the hospital.
The Air Navigation Indonesia informant Yohannes Sirit stated that Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News.
A helicopter was manufactured from Malikpapan of Kalimantan to carry him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news will break our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid of an increasing number of victims, since the country’s disaster authorities have reported a lack of connections with Donggala, Sigin and Boutong cities.
"The century is still expected to rise, because many bodies have buried in ruins and many people have not been sought", the agency's informant Sutopo Purwo said.

Micronesia crash: According to Air Niugin, one person is missing when the plane crashed into a lagoon
In Micronesia, the representatives of the airline that crashed into the lagoon are now telling us that one person is missing, although according to the previous report, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been possible since Saturday afternoon to locate one male passenger.
The airline reported that it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the missing passenger information, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane was hit in the water trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
The authorities reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed at the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause and exact course of the events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was run over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes told me that the plane landed very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to chain in the sinking machine in the water at the waist depth for emergency exits.
He told the passenger crew that they had panic and shouted, and that he himself had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seamen in the repairs of the nearby porter were involved in rescues by transporting people on a beach on a rubber boat before the plane drowned to depth water of about 30 meters (sa hundred feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the collapses of airlines registered in Papua-New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined in corruption.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when she was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed the re-treatment in which the man was accused of the burning of a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed hours as an expert in the field of computer science.
He described to the jury how he had used data recorded on the mobile phone when collecting the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim's Jessica Chambers movements on the night the victim died.
Rowlett reported that he had received location data from a number of mobile phones, which indicated that Tellis had been contrary to his previous claims with Chambers on the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers at the same time that he was claiming to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford proved on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he'd be "electuring" because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he felt Chambers about two weeks after he died.
According to data recorded on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers died, he deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The final speeches of the defence are planned for launch on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the jury to proceed on the same day.

Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark-haired one?
New York Children's Nurse sues the couple for racist SMS
A New York nurse sues a couple for a discriminatory separation after accidentally receiving a text message from the mother of the child, where this complains that he is "a bit darker".
The Parisian contests themselves as racists and parallels the challenge of "discrimination."
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her regret when the new babysitter Giselle Maurice arrived at work on his first working day in 2016 and became white to him that this was dark-haired.
"EIIIII, TAAS TUMMAIKEN", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
Then, however, he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the troubled Plasco-Flaxman had fired Maurice, stating that their previous passports had received their previous Afro-American babysitters and had been looking forward to doing their job badly, and this time he had been waiting for the Filipinos.
Maurice got paid for one working day and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice sues the couple in order to receive compensation for the dismissal and wishes to pay 350 dollars per day for the six months in which he was originally washed to live and work in the family, although without an agreement.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday, and he added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to the racist claims, saying that the decision to end Maurice's employment relationship was justifiable, because they could not trust him after they had offended him.
"My wife sent him something that he wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told me at the post interview.
"But would you leave your child at the notice of someone you've been unfriendly to, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco compared the challenge with blackmail and said that his wife had had had had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Let's start hunting another person in a situation like this?
It's not done very nicely," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in the social media by disapprovement of their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the audience would not identify a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born for a little while after the book was approved, says from the letter: “It’s hard to live in the position of a person who first read the book before publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
In fact, his father, who had worked as a CBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children’s books about toys, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary year of the publication of the books seemed bitter because his father died last year.
He described Paddington as "a very important family member" and said that his father was very proud of its success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he was not a man who'd be a repulsion at all," says the daughter.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as a child's achievement to him; something that you are proud of, although it is not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave Paddington his own credit."
I had to say good-bye on my dying daughter's phone.
His daughter was tortured after the plane landed in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save his life for nothing.
"They made a little difference and told me that the situation was really bad that he expected not to make it," says Ednan-Laperous.
Then they called and said my daughter dies in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
"I'm with you."
Medicines that allowed doctors to keep her heart running gradually removed from her system.
He was dead a little earlier, and now it all went out.
I could just sit there knowing everything was running out.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I had families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together."
In the end, Ednan-Laperous, a grieving daughter, got on a plane with other passengers who knew nothing of the trial she's been through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
"I knew how much she loved my daughter."
The dying women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a telephone number that you can get support from.
Davis' son Tyler got depressed when he was 13 and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I wouldn't want anyone's parent to experience the feelings I know every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, tells me that his son was a promising cook with an infectious heart attack.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said, "His smile lights up the whole room."
But he stopped working before he died because he felt like he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother who had taken the life from himself.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of after-effects.
Davis created cards "to raise people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet. You need to talk."
Humphreys has been friends with Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark 15 years after being together soon after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was all over the country on Christmas Day, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't take a look at them or anything like that."
He says Mark's death was a difficult trauma to them, but they still have to deal with it: "It will tear up the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But all we have to do is go on living and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts its investigation.
"I was thinking that if we could really achieve what he wanted - time and scope-limited research - we might be able to achieve a little bit of unity", Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "draw" the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican support want the FBI to investigate?
It's about timing in opposition.
The elections are only five weeks away, 6 November, and if the Republican success is weak, as is expected, their attempt to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's time and met with his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is drawn up?
The Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, when Vice President Mike Pence could blow the game and confirm his choice of the highest court.
North Korea's carnage is falling during Kim
According to South Korea's legislator, the number of people who created North Korea in South Korea has decreased since the seven-year entry into power of Kim Jong-un.
Park Byeong-seg quoted South Korea's Ministry of Harmonization and reported that the injuries occurred last year in 1, 127 - 2011 and they occurred in 2,706.
According to Park, the key factors have been the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in prices for human smuggling.
Pyongyang has not been commented on in public.
The majority of North Korea's logists are finally offered South Korea's citizenship.
It is noted that more than 30,000 North Koreans have entered the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a strongly protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats logists as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often returns them with force.
The North Korea-South Korea relations that are still technically in war have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear stocks.
This followed the historic meeting of June in which US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed on a general effort towards the Korean peninsula nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, told the United States that sanctions would be imposed after the meeting.
"Without any confidence on the part of the United States, our national security is not on a reliable footing and under such circumstances, we will in no way become one-sided to take out our equipment first," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelois calls Brett Kavanaugh "hystery" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hystery" and said that this was temporarily unfit to act in the Supreme Court.
At the Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas, the game commented.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her "hystery", Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was very emotionally denying the accusations that he would have sexually molested Christine Blasey Ford while they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in control of his emotions and between, he nearly shouted and lost his ability to speak when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the members of the Committee, without calling themselves "grotesk and plotting against the person", organised by the Liberals from Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential elections.
Your fear said that you believe that Kavanaugh's statement of testimony demonstrates that this is not capable of working in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be partial to the Democrats.
"I believe that he made himself incompetent in his statements and in the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
You were afraid when you asked him if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if this was confirmed and if the Democrats could get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"This is what we're saying - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only qualified for the Supreme Court, but also the court he's currently working in," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working in the U.S. Federal Appeal Court.
Your fear added that, as a democracy, he was concerned about the possible provisions of Kavanaugh regarding health reform or the Roe v Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative lawyer.
In its consultations on confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not an appropriate time for a hysterical and party person to be elected a member of the court and we should expect to say that it is wonderful", Pelosi said.
Women need to survive everything
This is a legitimate fire talk over months and years in rage, and he must not keep it crying.
"We sit when we're angry," Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
He continued: "I was enormously helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her partner in a situation where she was angry and started crying, "You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
Seriously, I'm mad."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are justified as a route to devastation, although they are generally fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I once cried out of anger and the older woman, a cold-tighted boss, who I always had a little fear of, took me from my neck and pulled me into the stairwell.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy because they got your mind sorry."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 on a boat with an out-of-marital relationship with a ship called the Monky Business and got out of the race, he was very frustrated with Schroeder's idea that there was no reason why he wouldn't want to be president himself.
"It was not quite a well-considered decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates already and the least needed one more.
Someone called the situation "Lunks and seven midgets."
Since campaign time was already on its way, he was behind the fundraiser and so he said he wouldn't leave for the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
To him, some of his supporters who gave male candidates a thousand dollars only gave him 250.
"Do they think I'm getting something from a discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he would have to take over his feelings - the gratitude of his supporters, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to collect funds for voters or for the election to the delegates, and I hate sexism - that he couldn't speak.
"You might think I'd get a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press's reaction.
"You might think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would probably be beaten into a monument.
‘He cried.’
How the US and China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The start-up to the US-China Trade War was superstitious, and even though the fight is anything but past, the country's outrage can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on the major Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most significant blocking took place with new customs duties, affecting import goods for USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion), taxing effectively half of all the products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has been responsible for each other at the same time, for the last time, for the last five to ten per cent of customs duties for US goods worth USD 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye - style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic model in the world would be evaporating for a moment.
In order to allow Washington to retreat, we should give in to our own demands, but public worship to the United States would be far too humiliated for President Xi Jinping of China.
However, experts point out that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, U.S. trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependency.
"A close political decision either in Washington or Beijing can create circumstances that start the economic impact cycle in one of the two countries, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the bystanders have understood so far," says Abigail Grace, who is a research assistant in Asia, Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is "prepared" for the return of refugees
Syria says that she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country after a devastating war of more than seven years.
When speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country will improve.
"Tilanne is now more stable and safer as a result of developments in the fight against terrorism," she said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
The circumstances now allow refugees to return to a voluntary country, where they were forced to leave because of terrorism and their daily lives and their livelihoods, because of unilateral economic activities.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful for its assistance in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. team at 16,5 against 10,5 at Le Golf National Airport outside Paris.
The United States has now disappeared six times in a row in Europe and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown itself when its Danish team of captain Thomas Bjørn reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The United States star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost all the time of the tournament and he hit his initials in the water on the par-3 track on the 16th Street, giving Francesco Molinar a match.
Italian Molinari smote with all the tours and became one of the four players who have achieved a score of 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth came out with a result of 5&4 European team of underprivileged players against the Danish Thorbjør Olesen.
With 2 and 1 England Ian Poulter, the world's top player, who could now play the last Ryder Cup.
Eight of Ryder Cup’s golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of all time at a total of 25,5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win this.
It is a team, and I am glad that I could be of assistance", said the moved Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He's moving the ring to his countryman Jon Rahm, who won a U.S. golf legend at 2&1 individual races on Sunday.
"I feel a tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods. I grew up wondering about him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now he has a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Real statistics from one of the best players of all time who have won 14 great wins and will only be left with Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding their journeys throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said after a failed show, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team in the games this morning.
We fucked up.
Honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to raise my hat.
"We met our winner."
