Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to home win at the opening of Savo Volley's second victory
The Hurricane-Loima, with seven consecutive men's volleyball medals, started the season in 2018-19 at home win when Raisio Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most effective in Hurricane.
There were some inspirations abroad, but they did not come true, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
We got a deal done pretty fast, Kouki said.
Like Koukki, Tomi Rumtune played 18 points as well.
The most effective of the guests was the national team leader Samuli Kaislasalo 17 points.
The victory of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience with the opposite side, and it brought extra extremism into the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the extension of the medal pipe is, of course, a goal, Kouki said.
The Greatest Savo Volley
Miro Määtänen was 18 points the most effective of Savo Volley when the team poured 3-0 by visiting Vantaa Ducks.
Our game was ambitious, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately, we got a squeezed victory.
At least I had no idea of a different charge when I played against my team before, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3rd series for the period 2000-01, made 12 points.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuivinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, or atmosphere on the roof all the time.
A good husband left behind with his home opening.
Miro was a king, Sillik played a good game, Tuivinen said.
The previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at the Pielavede Sammos when he was still head coached.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective 14 points.
Mikkelen again Star of Aka-Voley
Over the 2012-13 league point exchange, Joni Mikkonen has also begun this season strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Aka-Voley took his season’s opening victory after he dropped the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has begun well at its own place.
Today, of course, we were close to losing, because we were fourth in a loss of 17-21.
Some gain was dug, and the fifth lot came in, and Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective of the Tigers in the finals had made 28 points by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Man Alexanders Kudrjashovs supported 17 points.
We didn't get much for the guy's hacker, Mikkonen said.
Finland compared human capital with World One
Finland is at the top of the world's human capital comparison, reports the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top line was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was placed in one of the higher places and was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, we will look at the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has focused its human capital on economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletico in his hand, the local game ended with no paint
Real Madrid's goalie Thibaut Courtois venny with a grandet train, and the local game of Madridian teams ended up in an unpainted tie late on Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to goal, but the Belgian guard, Courtois, was able to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico for three times with a loan fraud when he was Chelsea's player.
In the first week of the International Football Federation, Fifa chose him as a goalkeeper for the year.
In the Real, the best goal was given to Gareth Bale, but his shot went past the finish of the finish line.
After the break, Bale was switched because of a travel injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real's supporters called the name of Cristiano Ronaldo who moved to Juventus.
The U.S. is now being attacked against abortion... and the powerful documentary tells us why.
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected President Donald Trump's candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh, with a decisive voice, could be repealed by a decision known as Roe versus Wade, which made abortion legally in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - United States and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also current in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public service work against safe abortion and has received various support from most of the people in our country.
At the beginning of the powerful document, we will meet Gynaecologist Colleen McNichola, who, because of the blackmail of the laws, has remained the only doctor making abortions in the state of Missour.
The armed guard at the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion of the United States.
News videos resemble deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's go back to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Church Men’s Association guided women to trusted abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of an abortion himself.
The death rate in the U.S. was about 5,000 years.
In particular, the Republican Party was in favour of the legalisation of abortions.
Already in 1967, in California, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the Aboriginal Law.
Later specifically, Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, began to revolutionically confuse religion with politics to hug voters.
His abortion was also passed over by George Bush's older successor.
And the same thing did Donald Trump.
The document of the deepest core of the matter is reaching the bottom of the search for a root cause for abortion policy.
When religious organizations in favour of racial discrimination were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
They picked an abortion for a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary bonds to politics.
In writing this in the United States, this is the situation in which a sek, with its indirect harassment, has been challenged, but the President who has taken the religious right with his abortion has chosen Kavanaugh as the highest court candidate, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can have the power of the Lithuanian-based power to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children at the border with great demonstrations
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed six months after Israel has shot protesters in the border zone.
On Friday, Israel’s soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Two children are among the dead according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health: 12 and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 wounded bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when the protestors cast Israel's troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has begun to use force so that the protestors do not break down the border fence or aim on the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the demonstrations in Gaza since March, when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 people are wounded.
The protestors call for access to the Palestinian families to the areas where the Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli State was established in 1948.
The Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives by stamps and helium balls on the Palestinian side have set fire to forest areas and agricultural land in Israel.
The Teemu Santa got the penalty shot, didn't get to shoot himself.
Wigan's top pair, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have taken him down with a tail in the penalty zone.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the tactics were clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe her eyes.
I think the situation was going to be plagued by Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to the penalty at the 85th minute of Santa's fall.
Ward showed some punishment, and Mario Vrancic hit a 1-0 victory.
Santa's made five goals for Norwich in the Master's Series.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with breast muscles.
The work tastes like Santa again.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended himself unsatisfied.
Norwich had a match in five weeks.
The team's on top of the league.
There's a five-win tube in the back.
Pedophile auxiliary service was immediately filled with reservations - Finland has about 40 000 experiences of interest in children
According to Arino, at least two per cent of men and a small part of women experience some sexual interest in those of my age.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Up until now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Service Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in spring, the email message and appointment hours were completed in Sexpo, offering advice and therapy, Yle says.
However, these are promised in the course of the coming autumn.
The sexual preference of children is a disgrace for many.
Most of the pedophiles themselves have not made their fantasies, nor have they committed any criminal activity.
However, pleasure is usually a permanent characteristic.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also challenge normal life, says Yle's sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as a special expert in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Koreo's leaders or the Congolese Gynaecologist?
As President of the United States Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorite winners on the basis of the betting campaigns.
The background has Trump's role in getting North Korea at least at the level of speech to commit to nuclear diversity.
The biggest beneficiaries of peace with Nobel are the South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korea's leader Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace treaty between their countries.
Warming between Koreans is remarkable, for last year the gap was still bad.
Yet for years the reward of Kim, which leads to the threat of nuclear weapons and the iron withdrawal of his country, would undoubtedly also increase criticism.
Nobel prizes will be announced from Monday, and on Friday there will be the most attention to be given to the peace prize.
If the award is not awarded to those who participated in the Korean peninsula diplomacy, there is one leading Congolese Doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital, the gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of mass rapes in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become leading experts in the world.
Mukwege has, in his work, paid attention to sexual violence, which is a terrible side product of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has said that 331 candidates will be awarded this year.
The names of candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he had a Nobel.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he felt that he deserved a peace prize.
Everybody thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said I was smiling.
I want this done.
The award I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued to refer to North Korea negotiations.
But there are some things that make Trumpi's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and the multi-stakeholder world order - exactly the kind of international cooperation Trump has seen as a opponent.
In the 21st century, three US politicians have been awarded the prize, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
The award of Trump would therefore require the Nobel Committee to provide an ideological translation.
Fire report in the tunnel: Car drivers behaved like soldiers and drove in the wrong direction
On 8 September, the traffic loss in Lohja took place.
Tunnel area traffic was cut off due to the notification, both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
Once it was found that there was a system failure, the fire department was trying to make traffic normal.
But it didn't work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Centre said that it cannot be opened, because there are drivers on the road to the shock and they drive how it happens, the drunk-ass fireman Pasi Keäräinen told STT at that time his fresh start.
At that time, the motorway was set off to drive even in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against the rules of traffic, a few others are often followed, Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Transport Security is amazed.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for a mandatory reason.
Transport security reminds us that, in exceptional situations, it is not possible to go into danger with emergency solutions to transport.
Emergency vehicles shall always be allowed to travel as without obstacles as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is particularly prohibited, as is doing a u-turn and withdrawing.
The same bans are also valid in tunnels where, in addition, the driving lights must be switched on.
It is also prohibited to stop without imperative reasons, as is the case with parking.
There have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush his snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, says Heiskanen in the Transport Safety Information.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party, even though the ship was caught on the lake floor
Inland Watership M/S Tampere’s fans would have liked to remain on board the ship’s victory party, even though the ship had been caught by the lake at the time of the event, says Juho Syrjä, the ship’s commander.
The M/S Tampere from Hämeenlinna to Tampere drove late on Saturday night off the road and stuck to the bottom of its bow in Vanajavede Aka.
19 passengers on board the ship and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in a man's life.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until morning, but of course it made sense to send them on their way to the fire station to port and on the bus home, Sirja said to the STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the game between Ilves and HPK, which ended in Ilves’ 4-3- victory.
According to Sirja, Saturday’s buddy was responsible for the fact that the water’s surface in Vanjaved was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also made difficult by the fact that the nearest sign was covered by log rigidity, so its reflections did not appear normally in the dark attic.
No more significant collision
In the western part of the narrow Jumusensalmi, after the ship’s route had been submerged by the motorways between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrja, the greater drama of the case was not associated, because the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the ground caused a more significant impact.
According to the circus, the catch on the bottom has not caused any leaks or heavyweights on the ship, and the cruises of the ship, as they see, continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver came to check out the ship's proper condition before they started tow off the ground.
In the interests of security, we are going to the shipyard to check that there was no damage, Mr Sirja says.
Sirjä believes that the next M/S Tampere cruise, which is scheduled for next weekend, can be managed in a satisfactory manner.
The cruise season of the ship will continue until the day of independence.
No use for ambulances
The rescue facility received an alarm on Saturday night, a little after a half a year and a half.
At the port of the wine, ambulances were called to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
A friend of mine, Matti Willman, told me late last night that evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and quite a loud wind.
Following half three Sunday nights, Pirkanmaa's rescue department informed us that everyone on board had been evacuated and that passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been renovated in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Dr. Trump, accused of harassment and drinking, may not be in a state of excellence.
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well remain silent, evaluate the Programme Manager Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their study days.
According to Aalto, the doubts have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump can end up playing a role in another person.
There have been times in the United States that the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court has been greatly conflicted.
In that case, the judge is usually drawn by himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
The name would rain in the valley of the Democrats
The US Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a very sensitive political process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aalto, the decision is likely to take place in the valley of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming elections of Congress.
It would increase votingism among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The appointment will not take place for every term of office, since judges of the Supreme Court in the United States will be appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired from their own request at the age of 70 to 80.
Some Republicans also hesitate to call
The Supreme Court of the United States will normally have a background check, Aalto says.
Although Trump has only assigned a week's deadline for further investigation by the FBI, according to Aalto, something essential can be raised.
Yeah, well, it could bring it.
There's not a lot of smoke without fire, says Aalto.
At least, according to Aalto, it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or incompetence in office will be discussed very carefully before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate between 51 and 49 votes, but at least two female Republicans are considered suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be taken to a vote and the Republicans lost.
She identified Salisbury as a military intelligence agent.
The Russian woman has told BBC that she has identified Salisbury as an agent for Russian military intelligence.
Based on the photographs, the woman reported that it was a military intelligence conference with Anatoli Tshepi, working at the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported that they had previously revealed the second suspected men suspected of being Tshepiga.
In the past, they said that they found evidence that men’s existing identity is covert individuals.
The BBC group traveled to a village near the border of Russia and China, where the Czech Republic grew up.
The woman in the village identified a young Tshepigan Bellingcat from the images.
He recognized the same man from the British police that turned out to be Ruslan Boshirov a man now calling himself.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novithok nerve poison in March.
The Scripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has, among other things, been awarded with an honor mark of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected GRU connection.
Back in September, suspected men reported that they were tourists in Salisbury in an interview with Russian TV.
The old people in the war reform as a throwing bag
We have now received a live example of what the Government of Sipilä means in practice to limit the change of the war reform.
My municipality, Vaala's sote services, are produced by Oulunkaare Municipal Association, the former regional director of Attendo, who has been elected Head of Health in 2016.
The heads of the municipal association shall warn the delegation of the restriction.
If the war costs rise now, the government will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were terrified, and the majority of them are prepared for a large change in the structure of the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the institutional care of the health centre’s bed section and to a small unit of memory diseases.
Home care would be added, which means that old people living in remote villages will be treated as "home" next to the health centre.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay its customers.
The left left-wing committee did not take bad preparation, but held a good public meeting with many family members, immediate nurses and also other parties authorised.
I presented the so-called so-called regional preparation on how the municipality of Vaala is already the biggest management of the elderly at home in the whole of northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a delegation from the neighborhood from Carina West.
The local newspaper made a big deal about the occasion, and it raised Oulunkaare’s manufacturers to their backs.
Sote manufacturers don't write any papers about the fact that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vala, which is now waiting for its empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers speak only of service settings, but do not tell what level of care it receives or what type of staff structure Attendo will treat the elderly until the delivery.
Without a nurse?
The facilities of the health centre are stopped because there is no medical night call.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at the Vaala health centre.
An example of poverty is the way in which central officials run the authorised information and the authorised persons are placed on the back against the wall with a change limitation.
In this way, the Central Party will empty the people of Vaala, for who will remain safe to live on a voluntary basis if there is a chance to move away.
Is there one electoral clause in downtown that the whole country is considered to be inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a major scale job in Cologne
Thousands of people in the city of Cologne in Germany showed their opinion when Turkish President Recep Tayyp Erdogan opened up the largest European Musketeer.
Several hundred people had been gathered on the shores of the Rhine since morning.
Erdogan was not welcome, read in protests by protesters, and Fascism was condemned in protests.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have been organised and security measures have been strict.
About 10,000 people were expected in advance to protest against the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
The supporters of Erdogan had also been gathered around the major museum fair.
However, the police had isolated a large region’s mosque from the environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan welcomed the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel swore that they would rebuild relations between countries which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup d'état.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including with regard to human rights issues.
Review surrounds your visit
Both Henriette Reker, the mayor of Köln and the Prime Minister of Nordrhein-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the openings when the review of Erdogan's visit was accelerated.
A 30 - year - old student from Turkey, Cansu, reported that he had come to protest against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice to those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They're under arrest, killed and under arrest.
For Erdogan everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the last stage of Erdogan’s German journey in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
Three charges for the murder of a journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told me that three people were accused of the terrible murder of Kuciak and his fiancée, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuicik was found shot in February with his fiancée in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected the murders of Kuciak's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of the Karelian on Sundays in the decentralised areas
Because of the result, the Sunday Karjalainen will also be posted as an addressless person.
This may appear in the distribution of the magazine in distributed areas where distribution to co-boxes is required from external memory.
The situation was the same as for Saturday’s magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Postitus puts extra paper bouquets in the county.
Journals of other subscribers of Finland will only be posted on Monday in tarnished form.
There is a considerable delay in the distribution of these magazines.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The editor, Arto Nyberg, is interviewing us today in his forthcoming discussion program, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa's at the studio telling us about his coming space trip, which he booked from Virginia Galactica already in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was to be paid as a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a while ago.
However, the date of departure has postponed for one year.
Now it appears that after an unfortunate trial that occurred in 2014, and even a death victim, things are in the hole.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
The Vesa flight number is 300, which is about one year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours, and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km high, a Finnish astronaut tells of his future home page.
At the same address, he also calls for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel, and I saw a Star Trek series on television.
The war of the stars has been seen, and that's where the idea is.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host
Manchester City continued its unspoiled journey to Valioliiga when it fell 2-0 on Saturday at its home field of Brighton.
The sixth victory of the reigning team is guaranteed by the goals of Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct the fourth distance of the season to an empty goal when Leroy Sanné found him at the back of Brighton paint in 30 minutes.
Agüero picked up his own scorer to five when he saw Sterling and his team back in Brighton with 65th game minutes.
The Argentinian was able to invest 2-0-strips easily from the scene of the penalty.
With six winnings and one drawoffs, the city that started the season will lead Valioliiga to 19 points in the catch.
However, the less played one match, Liverpool, was only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night at its own seventh round match with a series three of Chelsea.
Youth associations chose new decision makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations elected new decision-makers for the next three-year period 2019-2021.
The president was elected President of Anu Sivonen Ylä-Savo and vice-president of Petra Mäkeläinen Hämä.
40 members and 40 alternate members were elected, the Finnish Youth Associations will be informed on Sunday.
The Youth Society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural recreational activities known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year action goals: we keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal activities in whatever area and background, and support voluntary activities and people with their own growth paths, and the Youth Societys in Finland will be informed.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "A very important driver"
In an interview with Blick, Mersu, British, she believed that the liberalisation of Kimi Räikkösen's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads the other driver of Ferrari at MM points Sebastian Vettel 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue at the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves in the counter.
I don't think Kim will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional, fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorites, and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has told me earlier that Räikkönen has been one of his first pictures.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamt about the formula number one, I played F1 at the PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian partial competition.
The competition begins at 14 o'clock from the scene, leaving the Valteri Bottas of Mercedes.
The evening paper will follow the race for a moment.
A-Yorten SM series championships became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top of the football boys’ series level ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before 13 o'clock, the starting points for the championship were clear: the FC Lahti Academy has enough first place in practice against Vasa IFK.
In order to change the situation in the last round, Ilvesen, who is second in the championship, has to win PK-35 and hope to defeat the sects.
However, the Lahtian Championship was practically confirmed before the start of the game, since Vasa IFFK had arrived at the Gulf with only seven players.
If the Spaniard had been one less, the match could not have been initiated.
The FC Lahti Academy won the match on 16-0.
In the break-in, the bayians led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Vasasian game is that the team has played part in the same players in the A-Youth SM series, the P20 series, and the Two-Six-Seven-C block of men.
The left IFK has played against the fall of the season in practice in the second century.
On Saturday, the second round, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in a guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFu in Siiljärven Toivala.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno, according to the rescue department, good luck was involved.
The passenger car drove out of the way and ended up on its roof in Eno at 9 a.m. on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue department would inform you.
Well, good luck with that.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet after the rain.
There was a police patrol at the crash site.
Supo looks forward to new ways of intelligence: Equipment acquisitions and recruitments already made, no outsider plans for action will be missed
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence unit has been prepared to acquire equipment and train personnel.
Upon entry into force of the intelligence laws, an increase of approximately EUR 10 million should be permanently applied to the budget.
The protective police (suppliers) in Helsinki's Ratakadu are already preparing its full head for the entry into force of intelligence stations.
Antti Pelttari, Head of Supo's Association, tells Western Media that there have already been acquisitions of equipment for future intelligence missions.
Serena Williams bothers me with a video of her singing in the topless, campaigning for the awareness of breast cancer.
Tennis' superstar Serena Williams is going to come around again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video with his Instagram account, where he sings only hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
The capsule is the 1991 Hit I Touch Myself of the Australian The Divinyls.
With video, Williams supports Australia's breast cancer association.
"I voted for the global hit of The Divinyls to remind women to carry out regular self-checks of [the breasts]", Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this set me up in the comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touched all women regardless of the color of the world.
Early detection is all about a and o - it is a fear of many lives.
The second writer of The Divinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when he was 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been done to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He lost breast cancer but gave us a hit-and-run song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In video comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams left me earlier this week on the Beijing tennis tournament.
The background is in an open tennis tournament in the United States three weeks ago.
Williams came to the head of the fight and, among other things, claimed that men would be accepted far more fiercely than female players.
A Chinese restaurant with mountaintopol is not suitable for height blinds
In addition to traditional Chinese sweets, restaurant offers wonderful landscapes.
China's Zhejiang province has opened an exceptional restaurant.
It is literally in the rock language.
If you want, you can look at the forest that spreads below.
In high altitudes, restaurant visitors are able to bark their lives in the Longquan mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you need to walk in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened up for visitors on 19.9.2018.
Youtube condoms wonder where the restaurant’s toilet is.
A walk to the restaurant requires a good form of base, a place to be told.
Korpela’s moustache ends today: This is how it all ends
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this is what happens to a domestic rural drama called Korpela, which has been quite popular.
The third production period has gone like hot stones: last week, 722 000 Finns viewed TV as a first performance.
The top figures in themselves no longer have any practical meaning, for Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not coming forward.
In the final phase of Jaska and Mirku's relationship, we are once again taking a real leap forward, and I think Jaska's mother is the first thing to think about.
Even between Anss and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events, very romantic, but then there will be once again a Laiho in the images.
The police are also suspicious about the man.
Still, no one can imagine the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, can hear some amazing news.
The final will of the district will come out to the shore of the tears of a woman.
After a week in Sunday nights, the latest episode of Sorjonen continues.
The Korpela alley drink today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts on behalf of and against
The Flu season is hot.
A lot of scars stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go infected, as the disease may be contagious even if their symptoms are small.
In some cases, flu symptoms suddenly occur, sometimes they appear in the veins.
In the latter option, you may already be infected by others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is already infected by the day before the symptoms start and go from five days to the week.
Children may become infected with the disease longer.
As soon as you identify the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when coughs and fever is no more, says Professor Gregory Poland of Medicine.
It is also worth avoiding training.
It's too fast to go back to the gym to slow down recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, put your nose in your nose and throw your dirty paper in the trash.
But it's a pain in the ass, right?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider using the protective mask.
The mask does not hold viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers won't be placed in the nose or mouth, says Poland.
There are also restrictions on the openings with the mask.
Then how can one avoid infection?
The best way to do this is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the missi tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and Misss are often connected.
That's what happened to Alina Voronkova, 23th.
The Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has been granted to his cousins of the 2018 crown of Finland.

Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was persecuted for my Russianness.
On Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all, Alina tells about Miss Finland at the semi-finals' ceremony.
After high school, Alina decided to start off on a clean table and change the Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, a mischief student found new friends, and the archer went on to roll, hopefully.
At the age of 15, she thinks she's an adult, but after that, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her present partner Jonah Hurrin, who is familiar with Pelicans' ranks.
After a career with SM-liiga, the hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the World Cup for the 18-year-olds.
During the early days of dating, a couple, or almost a year away, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning triangle and it would give me a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have a good trust, and the good thing about remote relations is that it remains at the beginning of the whole time, Alina was squealed in May.
From continuous growth to joy, death on our continents
Almost everyone is concerned about the ability of the earth to survive.
Yet exactly nothing is to be abandoned.
Long-term growth is sought by sustainable alternatives, but even the theory of a reasonable economy runs into major problems.

However, the long-running of earth’s capacity and climate change are threatening to undermine this market economy’s rock leg.

The police have taken one person to find out the possible share of the stabilization.
The police are also looking for a suspect in other events.
Events are being investigated as an attempt to kill and a gross assault.

The following editor of Philadelphia Inquirer Flyers, Sam Carchidi, after the match, strongly estimates that Lehter is part of the six attack groups, five of which will get a seat in the NHL team.
At the practice match, Lehter said Carchid was excellent.
In the second round, Lehter fought with the prowl, pulled the defender against him, and fed the man in front of the goal to the open place where Raffl was waiting for the goal.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere robbed the cart in Pyhäjärve - "Really caught by a stone block"
Inland watership M/S Tampere was driving to the village late on Friday night in Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue facility received an alarm about the water traffic accident on Friday night after 12:30.
A 30-foot ship in M/S Tampere has driven into a ditch, and is firmly attached to its bow with a rock, described as the sun-friendly fireman Matti Willman.
19 passengers and five crew members were on board.
According to the rescue department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are transferred by bus and bus to Tampere, told the manager, Jari Nieminen, at 1 a.m., at night.
Ambulances were called into the port of the wine to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police will investigate the cause of the events.
A friend of mine, Matti Willman, told me earlier this evening that the conditions at the lake are difficult due to darkness and rather severe wind.
According to the rescue department, the ship's fate is unclear.
Apparently, the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will begin checking the situation at the bottom.
Today, M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is an inland waterway ship operating as a restaurant ship with the maximum authorised passenger numbers of 180 persons.
A meeting space for private use shall also be available on board.
According to ship’s websites, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand Robert Helenius unpaid fees
The competition between Robert Helenius and Erka Teper, the boxer of the night, is covering up money.
The evening-Sanomat news today about the application by Mr Jakko Helminen and Vice-President Jussi Kokkila, which charged Helenius with late payments of over 80 000 euros in advance.
According to the application form, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to settle, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here and very much work has been done, says Kokkila to Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius’ current manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to the evening magazine showing events in the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the amount required.
According to the appeal, Kokkila and Helmine had offered their services financially in a state of Tukala to Helenius, and they promised to be able to organise matches and sponsor incomes for him.
In a similar way, it was agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay the fees only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay for anything, only receive the income they provided.
This is also a normal and unique practice in the management of professional athletes.
Wage work has never been agreed and that would have been absurd in the situation of Helenius, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the letter, from the outset, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the income distribution in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman would not have received the draft until the end of 2014.
He noted that the proposal, on its own, was a poor one and he cut off his cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not once deal with Kokkila and Helmas.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius was given a 'unidentified but large' drop in the work of the manager.
This year, an action has been brought on the same claims.
Helenius regards the ex post activities of Helminen and Kokkila as a poor one, as stated in his reply.
Helenius today meets the heavy-duty IBF series in Erkan Teperi Stuttgart, on the seventh floor of the challenging list.
A Heartful Man and Good Journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio felt the late radio driver and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long-line radiodriver and journalist Erkki Päll passed away when he was 83 years old for incurable liver cancer.
A report of the drunkard's death was published in the Helsinki News Sunday.
The announcement states that Päll died on 3 September.
Pälli reported on a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, Ile Vainio also saw the publication, which was grieved by the knowledge of a familiar fate.
He left me on Facebook as early as goodbyes, Ile Vainio says.
Vaio considers Erkki Päll as a multi-stakeholder who became a brilliant reporter.
She recalls that Päll was a man with quick hot-wires and funny stories.
I learned to know Erk when I was a little boy when I first went to Finnotop when I was 12 years old and started as a storer there.
Erk and I met back then.
He was then the informant of Finno, and in various tasks, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I moved to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions in which Erkki Päll was the standard supplier of all the stories about artists at the party.
He was always competent and saw how great a fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly to the skin of his interviewing subjects.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
For many he became familiar with Yle as a radio driver, but he also wrote great journalisms.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was good to talk.
During the decades, Pälli also worked at the Fazer record company with Hope Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the greatest passion in the sun was the radio work in which he had a unique style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became known to many listeners at Ylen ether.
The sun retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Ski Federation announced that the financial year ended in May of the Union showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The Federation describes the experienced "full-time" version of its economic situation, although the economy is, of course, being burdened by "a significant debt in balance".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid response and strict economic discipline.
We were able to respond to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and economic management of the operation have been impacted throughout our organization, Kulmaa reports in the press.
We have also succeeded well in partnering, and in the past, world cup yields were maximised.
However, also in the future, cost management needs to be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Ten people lie in the back yard of the hospital, please, on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building distinguishes those from an area where the need for the assessment of the needs of the surviving injury and treatment of the injured person has been collected.
Patients are also being treated outside due to after-hours.
One of the people who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old returner, Bahardin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I've got one kid, and he's missing.
I spoke to him the last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the military hospital in Palu, Dwi Haris lay down, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at the start of the shock at the local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to a wedding party in Paluu.
I probably got hit by a broken wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was a silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe, told Haris News Office AP according to the British Protocols.
Small stores being robbed
Please, at the evacuation center, a 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, was trying to calm down her hot baby.
He described the moods as tenses in the city.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, told Kusuma.
Many Please have slept outside or in a temporary bamboo cabin.
Even if the house was standing still, possible after-stamps could destroy it for good and bury the inhabitants.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in prison, please escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly some 560 prisoners, so there may be some 300 fugitives.
Donggala has also escaped from prison, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the magazine, the prisoners raged and set fire to prison after the guards had denied them to leave looking for their relatives who had suffered earthquakes and tsunamis.
Please reopen the airport mainly for aid flights.
Amongst the first ones, a C-130 ship landed on the ground that brought back aid supplies.
Commercial flights Please be allowed only limited to the field.
The pilots will have to land on the ground without the assistance of the air traffic control, as my air traffic control was damaged in a bad earthquake.
The rain wipes over Finland at night
The entire country spreads across the country, opposite Sunday night, from the west direction to a long area of rain, says the Ilcientist Institute.
The rain comes mostly in the water, but it is expected to travel or snow in central and northern Lapland.
The last night’s paws are not repeated as the temperatures below the cloudbed remain higher.
The more cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively under control.
Just in the west you can visit the package for a moment, said the sun-friendly meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone will descend eastward along the morning.
In the south and west, there's a bunch of bugs or a half cloud.
In the afternoon, temperatures range from 10 to 13 degrees up to Oulu.
The beginning week seems similar for temperatures in the south and middle parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in place in marine areas.
There are no special storms for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typical autumn weather.
It's the fall that's starting to get really serious, Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi’s basic not seen on TV
IL-TV allows you to follow Miss Finland's red carpet with a glamour and a velvet.
The entertainment suppliers of the evening magazine pull a direct broadcast on IL-TV from the red carpet of Miss Finland.

We were hoping he'd get to college before he left for the Massis.
The Russian Dimitri Father and the Inkerian Mother Svetlana believed her daughter’s success in the Miss Finland Financial.
The fresh Miss Alina Voronkov's parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov followed their daughter's first moments at a crown's end.
They snuck into the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the finals.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erik all the time, but half an hour before coming, Svetlana was laughing.
Svetlana is an Inker and Dimitri is Russian.
After all, Alina speaks a smooth Russian language, even though she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was a little more interested in acting and in many other things than in Miss’s career.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should be Missed.
But he said he wanted to be a radio driver.
Only later, Alina got excited about the beauty contest.
The parents' hope was that Alina would be able to reach the university before she could attend the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and in the end, Alina wanted to do her midwives degree before Missi.
Last year we asked him why he wasn't taking part, but he wanted to finish that heel.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults too.
He sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on the show, she sees it.
Alina's boyfriend Jonah Hurri is hockey for her work in Japan, and he was unable to get to Finland to encourage me to love him at the final.
Allina's parents believe that the young people's relationship lasts a year.
That's what I'm talking about!
My parents were hoping that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
Now it's been such a long break for visits because of the masseuses.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - he remembered the idea of a cartoon: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At one time, my husband’s statement, in which he proposed it to be the person I developed, tells an Espoola cartoon blogger, a home mother, and an ex-European translator, Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo reports that in Brussels, he was an EU translator in economic and legal affairs until ten years ago, after a fourth child, he became a returnee.
I've enjoyed being a homemaker. I'm so good.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what would happen when even the smallest child began to be big.
Then in 2014 a cartoon came into the picture.
The bishop tells us that he had never dreamed of doing a comic book, even though he had read Aku Anka, Tint and Asterix since he was little.
Last time I was a child, but when these organic manuscripts began to develop, the situation changed.
At first, I made some dozen manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b.2000) is a skilled designer, but I did not get to be attracted to her until summer 2016 when I donated Viivi with a drawing plate.
His zeal lasted about a dozen stripes, and then he was forced to begin to try himself, laughing at Piippo, which tells him that the drawing board was a great incentive to him.
The drawing board is easy and convenient to try to get something early.
I didn't even try to draw the paper, so Piippo tells me about his relationship with the drawing he usually does at night.
I keep thinking about manuscripts, but I usually don't do it at the same time.
It takes more than a few hours to reach one of three squares.
I might be able to make a screen at a time, and I'd love to play with the colors.
To start drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the contemporary series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
As the people of the organic grass, the L- theme has run over by a carrot-shaped mother with a salad-haired softness.
The other people are the Man, the Pissis, and the Twins.
In the world of organic grass, man is what he eats.
The ideas of this series come from their own lives and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a coercion, even though the organic sphere is intrusive.
The bishop tells us that he read his series with his husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling to look at the cartoon he drew, and to say that this is what I've done today.
And there's plenty of challenges for my mom!

Indonesia's earthquake: The pilot sacrificed himself... didn't leave a crackling tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old flight leader, has become the hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he was safely traveled from the earthquake to the island by hundreds of passengers.
The young person was in turn in the air traffic control of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city, where the earthquake struck on Friday.
As the rest of the flight control tower fled, Agung refused to leave his place before he could be directed off the runway of the Batik Air passenger plane.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, AFP was told by the Indonesian Aviation Administration.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
My pilot-in-command was squealing and squeezing.
Finally, Agung tried to rescue himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he had severe internal damage.
Agung was tortured to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, told The Jakarta Post.
The crash continued to increase after the flight got into the air and was eventually measured at 7.5 magnets.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
Indonesia's aviation administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn thought about Europe's end in trade war: "We need to look at the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the world economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said, in Ylen's first pillar, that although the tensioning tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions made by companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
So far, Rehn believes that Europe is a great cook.
It has been able to build a cease-fire with the United States and has contributed to calm the situation, including China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to follow the course of the trade war.
We'll have to look at the next Twit, and then we'll have to take a look at it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner on the way to Washington, but he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the euro area and the world's largest countries in the Western world.
On Thursday night, the market reacted fiercely to the deficit.
The deficit next year is more than 2.4 per cent of the national product.
Rehn sees the situation in Italy as worrying.
Five per cent of the loan stock in the country is problem credit and the non-ordered credit is more than 10 per cent.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to be once again in excess of its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it was in agreement.
There would be far more negative effects on the difference.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign after a fair year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor, Erki Liikanen's name has been vibrating in speech.
I'm sure it doesn't matter if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he wasn't going to comment on this further.
The super popular Black Box performances of HS will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki will be on sale
The popular Black Box performances organized by Helsinki Words continue again in the week to begin.
Other presentations will be held at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On October 23, the Black Box will be visited for the first time at Tampere Theatre.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
Tampere's performance is complete.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on the stage tell a long story of their preparation, which has not been published in any HS tool.
There's something back there that no one's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in Helsinki's night, an impressive report from across the globe and a story about a very topical health issue" says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the journalists and photographers of HS and to continue the debate.
Helsingin Sanomat has arranged the evenings of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been on the watch.
The black box was rewarded at the Bonnier gala for a year's Journalist act.
The winners praised a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring season 2019 The black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The presentation is also available in Tampere and Turku.
The performance we see at that time has different content than the evenings of this year.
The missing mushrooms were found with the "previous experiment"
The Finnish police's drone is the world's top priority: "We're asking for training"
According to the head of the Police College, the police can use drone in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in criminal investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the Oulu Police were able to find with the help of the missing caterpillar drone in Raahe in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Director of Police College, referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "by the use of unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are the world's top priority here too".
Drone's a new cap and a newer police mission.
There is no statistics that the Finnish police are master of the use of drones.
According to Himbergi, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
This has occurred, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There's so much interest in that, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to look at Finnish police drones.
We're being asked for training.
Increased public awareness
Himberg recalls that finding a missing person in Finland's winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As stated, in Raahe's case, lost persons were found with drones in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're supposed to be trained more.
The drone is already being used in police duties, and their use is becoming widespread and increasing in the future.
That's what I'd be willing to say, Himberg's telling you.
In addition to searching for missing persons, according to Himberg, the police can use drones, for example, in accident or crime investigation and in certain types of intelligence.
For example, we need to go over some area a little further, possibly in fear of violence.
In this case, Dronea can use pre-disposition.
Karjalan Rugby got up to number one.
Karjalan Rugby celebrates the victory of the 2nd Division at Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match at 7-12 at the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period, they found a plot and dried the South’s guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew that Karelian Rugby had a historic rise in its 1st Division.
In the past, the company has played first, but at that time the Finnish Rugby serial activity was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-sector 1 division.
The Society is going to take a serial spot, but it knows quite a job next winter.
The current 20 players roster must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and the longer play travels, so it also needs to be consistent with that.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirmed by the head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens in the NHL, confirmed on the Twitter account that the Finnish worker Jesper Kotkaniemi will begin the season in Montreal.
Montreal made a super promise to Kotkaniemi, in the first 18th round, at three summer booking events.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength from the end of the summer and has presented strong extracts in September's training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to make a goal in the first training game.
The main coach, Julien, congratulated the Finnishman for taking on big developments after the arrival of the new entourage camp.
The NHL hull series begins next Thursday night against Finland’s time.
Montreal will meet on the opening round of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader?
A lot of leadership has been said this week in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Nokian Government, reported the interview of HS about Paranoid’s optimist in which he illustrates his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he appreciates the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Olllila strongly challenged the accusations, but the previous Nokia reports have talked about the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and speech, which in part caused the collapse of mobile business.
The company's ability to take risks and togone the company's recovery phase went missing.
A major business event was held in Helsinki this week, the Nordic Business Forum, which drew the Finnish Business Club to Finland.
In addition to Barack Obama, Lavalle rose up, 12 stars of the business world.
Talk about good leadership was enough.
The legend of the leading doctrine, Gary Hamel, said that a good leader must dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are spiritually bound to past decisions.
John Mackey, who is known for the extensive selection of organic products, said that the director must be able to communicate with the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that can't only be the purpose of winning to owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts in the book of Success, told me that the most successful leaders are studyally humble.
They're acting calm, quiet and determined.
Often they're introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodara, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must be hit by a single stage of the company’s life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A mature company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum listened to 7 500 visitors, mostly Finnish leaders.
As a threat, they had an information thing.
A lot is going on from a good leader.
That is why leadership is so often wrong, including at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Olllila.
They spoke to each other in a kind manner.
But I doubt they wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility wasn't easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived in a gorgeous red carpet right from Los Angeles, spending most of his year abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived in a beautiful black dress.
The 2012 dress of Miss Finland also had a lace patch.
I'm a little bit of a hangover.
I came back from Los Angeles again.
For a long time, I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me what he's been doing.
Chafak tells me he's going to Loss for the audition.
He's been doing some kind of advertising photos.
In the United States he describes himself as interesting, and also similar to that of Finland.
True, work needs to be done harder than ever, since the model is always easily replaced.
We have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The Danish police found a major Volvo in the operation: "We can't tell you what"
The wide search by the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was closed on the bridges of Juutirauma and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själland was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered to Sweden.
IS reached the commander of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We've found the car that's been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, but Henrik Storm from Copenhagen police report will tell Ilta-Sanom.
According to Strom, the black Volvo that we're looking for doesn't have a direct connection with the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish extra Bladet told the police about a Saturday press conference.
Detective Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was on the run of a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell us which criminal title they're investigating.
However, Skov told me it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to people's lives.
There's been a search of three people in the operation.
The police won't tell me if they've been caught.
According to the paper, restrictions on ferry transport have been withdrawn.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events with their Twitter account.
The STT reports that, according to the police, the general public no longer has any cause for concern, as the threat was for certain people.
For decades, the name of Macedonia has caused a difference - the people now vote in disputes
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on the proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the Republic of North Macedonia should be named.
To date Greece has prevented the efforts of Macedonia to become a member of NATO and of the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The issue of referendum does not mention a new name, but the question whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement.
The vote began very closely at a school in the city centre of Skopje.
Oliver Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at school, expressed his support for the agreement.
The referendum means change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
The name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts with Macedonia in 1991.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the Agreement.
The national right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see if there will be more than 50% of the voting culture required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes will allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The polling stations close in the evening of the Finnish time.
Nice victory!

Canada fights against time to reach agreement with the United States of America
In the middle of the negotiations between the United States and Canada, there is a risk of ending the free trade agreement between the US and Canada.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and national negotiators have discussed it closely throughout the weekend.
The Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
President Donald Trump's demand for the US, Canada and Mexico started negotiations some year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of the film, Mexico and the United States agreed, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before the Mexican presidential elections won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will take office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans to sign an agreement at the end of November were with Canada or not.
In view of these timetables, the agreement text between the United States and Canada should be prepared on Sunday to allow sufficient time for the US Congress to assess it.

Students display rare flavors: the ancient tragedy - a pured Oreste affects its visualization
Antiiki’s tragedy is rare on Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre University brought the only permanent playtrilogy of Aischylos oresteia to the national tour starting with the National Theatre.
In the Lavat open! projects, which started in 2015, actress students at the Theatre University work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is conducted by Mikko Roiha, Berlin.
Its international first night was won by Oreste in Berlin in April.
Roihan's reconciliation in Orestheia brings together a report on the end of the blood testament of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law to a well - known twenty minutes, especially by summarising the shares of the choirs.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsún’s fine Finnishman (2003).
Dramatic lights and an exhibition revealing the pages of the theatre space highlight a simple and bright idea.
Its center has, alternately, a dynamic between the actuators of the shell, the actuators of the nominal roles, and the choir.
Both double and triple seats are used in the brochure.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the killings of Agamemnon from the Troija War and Kassandra in this war hall will be shown at the stage, unlike the custom of the ancient stage.
Of course, the performance does not stress that it is loyal to the ancient performanceist tradition.
Rather, the viewer’s eyes create a modern, faithful interpretation of the text, which is constantly conscious of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in raising a group of actress students in the Master phase, a group of rhythms being present as a single organism.
In particular, in choir sections, actors tend to get into their rights with great expression, sculptured group formations, but only by cleaning the white curtain, on the stage.
That's impressive.
Oresteia performance tour continues to take place in Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures his first hydrogen truck.
The novelty will start in Europe, in particular, thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyinda and the Swiss H2 Energy.
In accordance with the cooperation agreement published at the Hannoker IAA vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will provide a new model for the thousand car items for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market the fuel-powered truck Hyundai will continue with Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring on the road as a vehicle manufacturer.
With this world’s first project, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network, the Vice President of the Hyundai Motor, In Cheol Lee, said at the publication conference.
The chickens flunked several times in Kajaan
A little over 30 men were assaulted by three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and on Saturday mornings.
He first hit one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the place.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and, in the absence of a third man, he was still hit by a abuser.
The police caught the abuser.
At the police station, he was still aggressively acting and kicking another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the jail to calm down.
The matter is investigated in three cases as assaults and as a violent opposition to civil servants.
Another case of assault occurred in the city of Kajaani on Saturday from the morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, about 20-year-old Kaianisman hit the victim.
Sooner or later, another man poured him down and the man who had hit him was still kicking the victim.
External abusers pulled away from the victim and called the police.
But the killers have already been able to leave before the police arrive.
The police will ask the observers to contact Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at the investigation. only@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio driver Erkki Päll is dead
Erki Päll, known as the long-term supplier of Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio driver Erkki Päll, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
It's going to be all right now.
Even the doctor has said that I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening press a month ago.
The safety of trade tattoos and setes must be guaranteed
For the first time, I received a lecture in 1984.
When a case on these rings is surprising, it is usually a matter of great news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the security of retail workers, I was surprised and at times even a little angry.
I also talked about the case with the Job Environment Specialist Erika Kähä, the Finnish Trade Union for Services (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers of course claim otherwise.
The police are only informed of clearly serious cases and many cases of real violence remain unreported.
"It is true that companies have a duty to statistics closely on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect their data into anything," he said.
The mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
There has always been a problem in violent situations with no physical injury.
Psychiatric traumas, however, can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threatening violence is difficult to draw when aggressive threats at a certain level need to be counted as violence, even if there is no access to hands.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if they don't do what they do.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
At the time of the release of opening hours of shops, the media also had a significant impact on the safety of the sellers.
"That's when many employers arranged security services at least for night hours and to prevent work alone", Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, we'll make the wrong conclusion.
This would now seem to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, as a result of the security, the situation of the disturbance remained well under control, it was created that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
There is a high degree of abuse as a criminal, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been subjected to abuse does not want to request an investigation of a criminal who usually lives in the vicinitys of trade.
However, according to the same paragraph of the Act of 2011 the minor abuse will become subject to the prosecution if it takes place at the workplace.
I think we're going to need some kind of precedent.
The next time a trade aunt or uncle is being assaulted, the police should be investigated and accused by the prosecutor.
A court of law would put a few abusers in prison, and a judgment from there from the hard distance of the penalty would be cleaned up.
In a society where food trade must be open almost overnight, we must ensure the safety of workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed off on the miss before the start of the live broadcast, "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss's crown is not seen on TV as usual this year, but the broadcast shows on Viafree's website.
The broadcast is run by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet run by Janni Hussi.
Before a direct broadcast, the drunkard three told invited guests and media representatives about the cost of the shipment.
At first Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula the fresh applause.
Now all women scream!
Now look at this our man worshiper, Sohlberg rang out his colleagues in the crowd.
The main races are followed by many past years of Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next door, and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg smuggled around looking towards Sarok.
The more I think Sohlberg pointed to a newly divorced Siep, who laughed at the comments, even though at first seemed confused.
This is the first time that Sieppi spoke of his divorce in the Nightman weekend magazine.
Missikaunotatar said that she did not want to open up the reasons for the difference in public because it is a matter between her and Roope Salmis.
He said he had no rush to a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focused on my own business, and especially on living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage status came up at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally failed to call Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula into a parscism.
He was laughing at a third guy.
Iiro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed the muck.
The Northman tortured the tied open side by cutting, burning and feeding the strong sauce
A 34-year-old man living in Kokkola, northern Finland, has been sentenced to three years by the court of law for a number of crimes against his open-lawed partner.
Among other things, the crime was belt, cable and button ties.
The court condemned these items to the State.
Rank's charge was about a suspect in a gross rape.
However, this accusation was rejected.
The reason was four assaults, gross assault, coercion, illegal threats, corruption of freedom, gross corruption of liberty and two damages.
Crimes occurred between last March 26 and May 24.
At the end of these last actions, a man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the last week, the district court of Ostrobothnia sentenced the 34-year-old to remain in the Vasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two gross abuses of liberty and of gross rape on 22 May.
However, these accusations were rejected by the Court as invisible.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors in court.
However, the judge gave a public statement of the judgment.
According to the District Judge, the accused had targeted violence, threats, and coercion on the part of his spouse in situations where this had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, burned a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
Court of Justice ordered criminal equipment lost to the state: belt and cable, slippers, bath belt, knife and toilet.
Four Witnesses
According to the law of law, the parties continued to co-exist between actions.
It is clear from the judgment that a large part of the most serious acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
Four Witnesses, two women and two men were heard in the court.
A 34-year-old should pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering, and temporary harm of EUR 5800.
I don't think he has that money, because the convicted person already has debts in the past.
Prison is not the man's first.
The evening paper does not mention the convicted name to protect the privacy of the victim.
This is not legal when you write a recent judgment.
Europe under the Four Points Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals took the lead on Saturday in a traditional slot game against the United States.
Europe leads Ryder Cupia to a 10-6, which is played on the flames of Paris, while 12 games are still ahead on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four Saturdays of four ball games, and the 4th game of the afternoon was equal to 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won every four match they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, none of the European couples had arrived.
On Sunday, the two of us are looking for more history.
No European player has won five points together at Ryder Cup, and no American player like Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters of a fiercely disturbed Honka match: "The power of power is not part of football"
On Sunday, HJK published a release condemning its supporters of interference at the FC Honka tournament in Tapiola.
"We are improving the post-Honka-HJK events on behalf of our supporters", states the press.
At the end of the fight, some 50 HJK supporters were rushing into the field and some seemed to try to argue with Honga’s supporters.
There was also a fight between the pros.
The organisers did not get the situation calmed down. They needed cops and also horsemen.
HJK reports that the team's players and employees are shocked by what happened.
After the fight, the events are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old company.
"We are going to resign strongly from any action that endangers the safety of the match events," the release states.
HJK promises to assist authorities and event organisers in identifying safety threats and eliminating mitigation events.
The supporting culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
In every way, we support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football viewers.
"Nevertheless," says the press.
The Philippines explorer is flying a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a philosopher, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Pelloton.
He's a member of the world now that swears he's got a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors like Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used much of his wealth to build his dream.
She started developing her flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development of a drone car.
Recently, he says he's made the first successful test flight... he's flying his device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will produce a positive reaction.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL forecast: tomorrow's work fights will be shown in child day care and social and health services
In public and well-being sectors, the bans on over-work and exchange will begin tomorrow, particularly in social and health services and day care for children, assessing the JH President Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be broad and will certainly appear in such a way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone's gonna have to wonder how they're gonna get their kids.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that services are played and that no one's spirit is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, there was also a shortage of workers at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned for over-work and exchange due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that they have not been hired, but that workers have been overworked or changed shifts.
This isn't a work fight yet.
It is a norm to ensure that, for every worker, regular working hours are kept up with and only do so.
The JHL opposes action by the Government to reduce the level of redundancy protection for small businesses.
Labour Market Manager Markku Jalonen, municipal employers, does not undertake to ex-ante assess the effects of over-employment and exchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very fascinated, even though services may be weakened.
Employers from all over Finland are aware of this and have prepared what is to be done.
The area is so wide-ranging, social and health measures and the technical sector, that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employer, said Jalonen to the STT.
Jalonen says that experience has already been gained last week, among other things, from similar activities of the Super and Social and Health Union.
Their effects were rather limited.
The JHL's overwork and exchange ban applies, among other things, to municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family daykeepers are excluded.
At this stage, the fight against labour concerns almost 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Lamaine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other measures in the fight against labour if the preparation of the Act on Disarmament continues.
The government should now admit that this is where I run against the wall and hard.
Jalosen believes that both the Ay movement and the government must come forward.
This is very special that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not been given yet, Jalonen is updating.
The great coral rhythm is created by the power of children and adults in the fitness circles of the show.
In other places, the Great Korallirity of the Colonel received his first night in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was presented for another time in Finland, this time in Kanneltor.
Like the earlier works of the group, the Great Corall resistance is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
However, this time a clearer cross-border presentation is also being built, which will refresh and crystallize the findings of the initial exercises.
The theatre games have enough magic for children.
The child’s perspective has already been involved in the preparation of the work.
However, the great coral resistance is not a children’s performance but a performance that adults and children work together.
It gives adults information and observations on the way children receive information and do art.
The ability of children to throw away exercises and play together also relaxes the distance between adults and children.
The Great Korallirity reminds us of some sataballet, a fitness circuit, and natural information attack, but finally it flows around in different, non-human conditions.
The great coral resistance begins from the knowledge of corals and coral rays of living organisms and fish.
Six different fitness areas teach, among other things, the gestures of the rausks and the sea horse.
Finally, a presentation of less than an hour in which music, lights and shiny goals and costumes will help you to get to know the life of coral ray.
In the Great Coralliruta there are both divers who observe the life of the coral ray and the corals that we look at.
There are also coral - looking organisms.
The views and observations shown in many directions make the performance frequent and life-long.
Be it the landscape of some organism, the life that looks at the landscape, and the other life or landscape that looks at the world, and all this at the same time.
It doesn't seem very difficult for children.
In other places, the group is trying to train itself to think and act within the limits of getting caught when the group is made up of children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitator has a silent demonstration of interest on behalf of endangered corals.
The destruction beyond human understanding must not be hard to understand, even though it may be difficult to understand the importance of exercising self - compassion before the sight of destruction.
In other places, the work has been built in such a way that it respects the diversity of life as well as the political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of awareness, other species, and future generations of those whose wonders and play it will clear up.
The kids are growing up too fast. I'm glad my childhood didn't have smartphones.
Children and young people today are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
I think that children should be children throughout their childhood and not be confused because of drugs and sex because others say they do.
I was exhausted when my friend told me that she had to pick up her sister in fifth grade from "boy friend" on the weekend.
When she came to pick up her dizzy sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that children today will be able to live up to a proper childhood and that they will not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger girls in Instagram, who are in their pictures in the makeup face and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that reveal at night.
It's harder to think about girls than they are.
The 13-year-olds today can easily look 18-year-old and older.
My childhood was made up of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood didn't have smartphones.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Officials have told the government that the Airisto Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Ylen, the Defence Police and Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Council earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been told that the investigation of Airisto Helme is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime, News Yle.
The information from the sources that had appeared anonymously confirmed to Yle, Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (Kok).
According to Kanerva, this week the Defence Forces and Defence Police were in the Defence and Foreign Affairs Council reporting on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily to be financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculation that there was something else here, Kanerva commented on Ylen's interview.
According to Yle's information, no evidence of connection to national security has been found so far, but the investigation is only at its beginning.
There's no way we can know what's out there yet, one of Ylen's interviewables says.
A week ago, extensive search of the Turku Islands and the continent has raised the question of whether it is just economic crime or the threat to Finnish internal security.
This week, the evening magazine prepared a case that will review claims both for and against.
Video: The dream landscape saved a series that Liverpool lost.
Liverpool's 100 percent Valioliiga's start came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1- evener team at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it's gonna be a straight year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran off to a 1-0 guest win.
Then Pep Guardiola's combination sent the entire Valioliiga signal that City was serious.
Everybody remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager, Jûgön Klopp, arrived on the same idea in West London.
The Reds had begun with six successive victorys of Valioliiga.
Liverpool started stronger, and in particular Virginia van Dijk seemed to rule alone on his own ends.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had less than a Wednesday's fine league guest profit from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to solve the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, Homer was involved from the early days.
In the 25th minute, he first balled in a small space with the triangle Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the Croat saw him rush forward and sent him a fully-weighted passover.
Mr. Homer was a little set up on the edge of the penalty zone, but then he bombed the perfect left-hand bet in the back corner.
Half the Brassie Officer Alison was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't like his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss position to be somewhat unfair, as almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger put the Mo Salah guidance on the goal of the goal.
In the second period, Chelsea’s bachelor Kepa was able to get a real deal.
The Basque Guard reacts quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the pole to the corner.
At the second end, Alison zeroed her fall into the roadway through Hadard.
The best place for guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found his focus on Bobby Firmino.
However, Brassy Star's bag was headed toward the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the host's leadership.
It couldn't take more than 89 minutes after Mr. Daniel Sturridge was free to fire at 25 metres.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed his undefeated bet on the upper corner.
Liverpool's 100% over-start came to an end with a one-to-one game, but it's still in the league together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship two points behind the tip.
At the time of the clock transfer discussion, the posters are deep
I remember one decade ago when a magazine asked various Finnish actors, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Lesksen's answer was the only thing left in mind: Nen-end.
Some names have a nene end and some do not.
I mean, you could be born anywhere, and there was a tray here.
Finland has made the annual roll-over in the EU.
A lot of people agree that roll-over twice a year has been a job of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest step in the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing to do now is to figure out what time it will end: the current summer or winter or any other time zone.
This will also allow the people to express their views on the topic.fi page.
The inquiry has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is held in coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a say to say.
The wintertime is justified by the influence of the morning light on people’s well-being and summertime, with the effect of evening light on people’s appearance and thus on well-being.
Both have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies also show that the morning light beats the person's day and gives him a break.
On the other hand, if it is not particularly difficult to wake up in the dark, more light will be given to people moving outside and better opportunities, for example, in the autumn gardens.
The additional light has already been calculated to an hour after the normal working day.
I'd prefer to take both, but the evil can do anything for us in the northeast of the earth.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
The actual debate on this subject is that one’s own view is being driven and the other’s view is very strongly opposed.
The defendant’s argument is not much to listen to, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on this matter, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn one’s head around.
It's a waste of food.
The subject is a very simple debate, because the issue does not require great suspense and there is a need for a sense of light.
The same type of dispute is usually more severe and equally infertile.
It's a shame if the wrong option gets chosen, but don't you think it'll work out?
And it will always offer a suitable scapegoat if life seems to be a matter of thought.
Josba fought the target's foreign victory
Josba's first guest game in Salibandy Divar produced three sets against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki on his home trip with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still in the goal at the beginning of the third batch, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47 brothers Event and Juuso Lääthniemi plotted a 6-total.
A few minutes of decisive play was played in the ice-breaking of both teams.
Josban's most effective was Juuso Lääthniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepower anyway, when Teemu Kaartinen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) were also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (1+0) played his goal at birth also in the second chain.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
The next match will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
The 200th anniversary of Eno’s church Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated in some very sad atmospheres on Sunday.
A week ago, the extermination of the Sanctuary was a shock.
Even Eno's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a party place.
Although no one would like to, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Joensuu congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipalities and others of the world.
The family fair begins at Eno Church at 10:00 p.m. today.
After that, we move to the congregation hall near the cattle’s table.
The program has all kinds of things all day, both inside and outside.
For example, the church building is available with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who retired 37 years old, who served as a church master.
The church’s birth feast also means the end of one era.
Already removed, the church house built in 1982 will keep its doors open for the last time today.
Now we're in shelters at the former municipal hall, says the capper Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk is going after Tesla's head of the government's office, and the charges against Petos were settled for $40 million.
Elon Musk, the electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO of the company, have agreed their legal cases with the SEC of the US Securities Regulatory Authority.
SEC suspected Musk had committed securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being set aside for the company he founded.
However, the Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk has to retreat from the President of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company will have to be hired by the President of the external government.
The muscle is also subject to tighter supervision.
According to the agreement, Teslan must employ two independent leaders and further monitor Musk’s communication.
Tesla and Musk also pay USD 20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is to prevent new market failures and harm to Tesla’s shareholders", says Head Steven Peikin of SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the financing of the company was secured.
Tviit just picked up Tesla's stock exchange.
SEC suspected Musk had committed securities fraud.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with other management or potential donors of the company.
In practice, the Agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
On Friday, SEC announced that they'd sue the company and Musk.
SEC stated that Musk was required to be convicted of fines and refused to act in the management of stock exchange companies.
SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went to a strong fall.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia and tsunamis
In the earthquake in Indonesia and in the tsunami following, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, reports AFP, according to the country’s disaster office.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase, as there is some time to find out where the damage is to be destroyed.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kallan, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami, which attacked the city of Please, on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was given immediately after the earthquake, which was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, for at least for the time now, almost all known dead are asked.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala region near the centre of the flood, where the situation is still largely unclear.
A lot of people are already known to be dead.
Iron Calls for Assistance
The Indonesian army has been called to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived in the region today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue without being exhausted by day and night.
One of the rescue centres is a hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency in charge of rescue work, said that one of the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, popular by businesspeople, was brought to life during the night.
We also heard requests for help from people, he told us.
According to Syaugi, there would be a rapid need for heavy grubbing-up in the extremities and tsunami areas.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones in the lost ones.
Help me, you're in the Palace and nearby.
My friend's family are still missing, one writer called on the Facebook group.
Policy phone numbers leaked into the hands of the disruptors in Britain
Many British politicians were victims of harassment when their contact information was leaked because of the deficiencies in the application's encryption.
They were able to access, among other things, the telephone numbers of ministers.
This was an application used by the British Conservative Party in government.
For example, Brex is driven by Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Development, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson, who became victims of harassment.
A number of MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the app, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were in the mobile application of the Conservatives' annual meeting.
The audience was able to access profiles using the political email address that was easily available online.
The profile was created to view and edit the content stored in the profile.
Someone managed to switch Boris Johnson into a profile photo of porn and title as insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced by the image of the mediamoguli Rubyt Murdoch.
The Guardian's columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to login to other people's profiles at these email addresses.
Then you can view the contact details of the profiler and send messages in this name.
The meeting application made every supplier, politician and participant’s telephone number public, Foster criticised.
The Conservatory's informant asked for an apology for the leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now operating safely.
The British Information Authority supported the leak.
The application was drawn up by Australian Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party is critical of the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week there are a large number of protagonists in the audience of The Wall Finland
Attentioners paid attention to the overall reactions of the studio program The Wall Finland.
The U.S.A. The Wall beached Finland-version to Nelose last Saturday.
Heikki Paasose's host game show is described in the same studio in Poland where other international productions are made.
In the Polish studio, the description facilities were exceptional, as the size of the format as a large 12-metre high gaming wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the program’s studio audience, which was called Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate on whether the studio might understand the Polish people’s game to play in Finnish.
The head of four domestic programmes Unne Sormune illustrates the matter to the evening magazine.
He says that the studio audience has close players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international killers in Finland, just like the audiences in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such populations, so-called professional audiences, which are described in the various programmes, in the background of the Sormune.
He recalls that watching the game in itself is not so obvious, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls are easy to separate from each other.
However, there are interpreters at the foreign studio who are carrying out translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the event as a Simultanite seal for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of laptop there is, for example, being thrown and what the situation is going on, sormunen says.
He compares the situation with what David Hasselhoff was doing in domestic production at the same time.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago involved in Talent's Finnish descriptions in Finland.
He always had a Simultanic seal in his ear, and he knew all that was spoken in Finnish, the sum of the Sormune.
Japan’s south - south - coasted volcano is moving toward the main island, the authorities warn about the earthquakes and floods
The authorities also warn against potential land-strips and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifunu Tram, but the authorities believe that large injuries have been avoided and no information is available for the moment.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK General Radio Company, people have been evacuated to shelters and electricity has been cut off by over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in place to stop because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka at half a day in Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also promising hard winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami tortures Japan until Monday.
♪ I'm still in the sky ♪
The initial period of the batteries has been bad.
My dark sky is already almost as long as the team lost its home summer home to Vasaan Sport, with readings of 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The porese now have five consecutive losses, with a total of two points in total for six rounds.
No Ässie defender or two lower chains player has yet to score.
Pressures are also growing all the time.
A sport against the audience, you'll be able to hug at the very point when there was almost half of the game left.
Six games have only been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, in his care we must be, because that's how weak we'd play.
Especially in the second round, the performance was alarmingly bad, and Jarno Kärki did the 1+2 power.
To sport, of course, the victory tasted.
The team had a game down on Friday, so it would have thought it would be visible.
Maybe it did, but she didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors on the day of the bread continued to increase
The mother of the day of the bread Pirkko Hyvärine wonders the number of the event in front of the big hall.
Somehow, it was thought that this year, perhaps not so many people would come, that God would think about it in the morning.
In the autumn 2017 With the day of the bread, the tractor’s SM competitions were held at the same time, so it might be expected that the number of audiences could even fall from the previous year.
In other words, the corridors were holed up long before the 10th, the sellers told me that the products were finished, the newsbrokers were sold for nearly 500 doses more than before, and in the number of cars, Mr Hymaren heard an increase.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6000, and Mr Hyvärine will tell you later this afternoon.
For five hours between the morning and the afternoon, there was a special amount of program available for families with children, which, I think, attracted them to a record commission.
In addition, Härinen estimates that the event will take place further.
The sellers also pour into Liberia every year from a larger area.
This year, the salesmen of performers, craftsmen, pastries and harvest products had arrived at almost a hundred breadkeepers.
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hajären, desired the number of audiences from the hall’s audience.
At first, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's show, the beautiful bread of Teija Kiviniemen won a public vote.
The children’s bread contest arrived at 11 different kinds of bread.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, winner of the sandwich competition, spent the day in a martyr pie pot.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - this is where you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space, create the right mood for decoration and read the book without tired.
It's worth raining for good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to bet on lighting.
Vinkit gave Innolux's sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniem.
Do me a favor to your eyes.
The greater the number of years of age behind the lighting is increasing.
An adequate light can help with problems that many get along with age when the accuracy of the vision is reduced and more and more suffers.
Parents also have an increased need for light.
Sixties need light three times more than twenty.
So it is worth raining on the effects and characteristics of the light being maintained for health reasons.
A good whale gives you enough light, but it doesn't go away, something cool.
Create beauty around you
The beauty of the interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The interior of this moment can afford to choose.
The popularity is an elegant Japanese style that combines Scandinavianness and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, a modern and playful retrotyl with strong colors, with different shades of metal, or with ice creams have also been inspired by the 70s.
The authenticity is fascinated in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
Materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Showing your personality
On the other hand, more money is being invested in the home than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, our own home is wanted to be customized, a bold whale with a story to tell.
People are clearly applying for Finnish and Nordic products whose origins and designers are known.
So let's be well-designed, says some.
The home is not necessarily the latest trendy choice, but the timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, ageless and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year, something says.
Thank you, and good-bye.
Kokoo showed a door to the Canadian hunter after three games.
The ways of Kokoo and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are erring.
The Canadian worker played three League games in orange music with no power points, says Kokoo when he announced it.
O'Donnell moved to Koohoo in August by a one-year agreement involving a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season 26-year-old attacker played in the KHL in the Kunlund Red Star rows and in the KHL farm in KRS Heilongjiang.
We don't know about O'Donnel's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example for recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic shifted into paper
The game's special movement The Game Man is currently recycling not only games but also packaging materials.
The products from the Kivi Legs trade customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper boxes made from recycled materials.
Products ordered from online stores are packed in packages, for example, from importers.
All the packages that come to us go to re-use.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in order to be able to use it, says Ville Puurula of Oulu.
As soft materials, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycled material as a rule.
The door of the bubble is avoided as far as it is possible.
In the near future, we intend to move to recycling material in the envelope.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
It's not like turning around is the Purula's idea of causing any extra trouble.
There's no big problem starting to recycle.
It will also save financial savings when, for example, money packs are re-used.
Recycling is naturally suitable for the activities of the Gamer, as, in addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
For each fashionable purchase: One and the same shirt works in every costume
Classic clothing works in different costumes from season to season.
They create the foundation of a good garderob, since it is easy to gather different kinds of residents around high quality classics at affordable rates.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes the black half.
Black needles made of natural material may not have been mistaken.
The clothing can be combined with straight pants, poles, and jeans, and it can be created in a calmed housing as well as in a lively style.
The semi-one is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic sophisticated style magician.
That's how you create the style.
The autumn’s trendy story is made of gold browns and broad-leaded blind jackets, black half-bread and gray ankles.
The classic semi-one, together with other classics, blue-green stork and wine-red licenses, constitutes a womanly and sophisticated housing.
Bring a crack into the black half-breed by combining it with the trendy clothes of the pelt: the skirt, the tall boots and thick tights.
Young and stylish!
There is a long tradition of sabotage in Russian intelligence services
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or the GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups were specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian-speaking words diversionno-razvedyvatlanja group: sabotage and intelligence group.
Officials of the KGB of the Soviet Union Security Service prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, reports Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004) who had been established west of the KGB.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil treatment plants and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for cover operations for the Bundeswehr, railways, gamekeepers and certain factors.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed up in local Ukrainian police chest-baths, set up inspection stations for you leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
In the cold war time, agents hid package supplies for sabotage groups with mines, explosives, lighters, and media.
Still in 1998, Switzerland found the KGB’s cover, which was occupied by the authorities in spraying it with water tanks.
The police reached four cyclists in the county last night.
The police caught four cyclists across North Karelia the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, a 18-year-old man in the Contilahti area blew 1,57 promilles.
He drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaantis at 4:30 in the night.
On the Polvijärven Kuorvaranti, the car went down at four nights, and a 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew 1,54 pounds by the police.
There were no serious injuries to him at the time he was out there.
A 20-year-old foreign-based man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumu blew up 1.33 promillas.
The police suspect that these men drivers are not only about the gross driving drive and the driver of the Polvijärve, but also about jeopardising road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man transported a local van at the crossing of Öllöljänti and Hoikatie.
He's suspected of a DUI.
Police are calling for observations on the stabilization that took place at Turku Railway Station after midnight.
According to the police, a man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with the most life-threatening consequences.
It was recorded on the surveillance camera.
The dark-haired suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jackets immediately left the car in a dark farmers' car in the direction of the bus station.
One suspect left on the bicycle in the centre direction of the Humaliston street.
A pedestrian died freezing under a bus in Pori
In the pole, the pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after the bus hit him.
The accident occurred after 4:00 in Raumantie at the Ridingh.
The driver of the bus doesn't suspect a crime.
Police are investigating events leading to an accident.
HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, director of HPK Sports Centre, says that Filip Rika (cent.) has been important for the team in its initiatives, under-power gambling and defence role.
In the trial period, Philip Rika will continue in HPK at Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
Riska, 33, the success in the roles offered to him convinced the lead.
Philip has been an important piece of us in the initiatives, the sub-power struggle and the defence role of the four fields.
Although there is still some improvement, it is good to keep up with this experienced player, Mika Toivola, head of HPK sports, commented on the company’s release.
The hope is that the value of the Riska will rise while playing hockey games.
Riska has played league games earlier in JYP, Luko and Sport, a central player from Pietar Island.
Instead, the wingman Oskar Lehtinen stayed out of the deal after the trial.
The truth is today on TV: The climber was left dead twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journalney Home From Everest is based on man's own experience.
Tonight's movie is based on them.
Everest now gets his first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri's 2015 guidance relates to the struggle for survival, which has been treated with cereals.
The tragedy has been made of films and documents... before.
We're going through some real things in this case, too.
The highest mountain in the world 22 years ago took eight climbers' lives.
Two of them were experienced tour leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall just acted as a Weathers guide.
Weathers' life could have saved his eye surgery before he left Nepal.
As a result of its and air pressure, he lost his vision and therefore had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never returned.
However, the Weathers struggle for life and death had just begun.
When the storm got up, he got lost and he couldn't find back in camp anymore.
When they came to find him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
Like a miracle at the store, however, he got on his feet and found the others.
The worst-frozen Weathers were still thinking of dying, and once again he was left to the point of his own happiness.
It's clear that, contrary to the expectations of Beck Weathers, they survived.
At some point in time, those who were having sex started to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the movie Beck Weathers, Josh Brolin plays.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old Church of Eno
Enon's 200-year-old church is celebrated today at the church.
The church was dedicated to October 4, 1818, and for the celebration of the year, the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party began at the church at Eno at 10 p.m., after which there has been an antiquity table at Eno’s church hall.
The church was full.
The family Mass was attended by 517 people.
Mr. Enon, the Armi Rautábiori, was glad that people had come to the church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, says Rautávuori.
The fire of the Parish Church has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of Eno’s church.
The Church of Enon is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations of Joensuu since the destruction of the Church of Kiev.
In 1770 the wooden church was completed.
In the morning a charter was held in the wake of the attack, where the silenced and remembered the destroyed church was destroyed in the fire.
Pictures and videos: The media flashed into power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
On Saturday, a powerful hurricane-like storm rang from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or median, is named Zorbaks.
The Institute for Air Science in Greece has given a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesus, Ionian Islands, Kyklid and Kreeta.
The images taken from the region show plenty of floods all over Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared in the city of Kiato in Corinth, instead of the street, because of floods.
The second video shows how the car has been driven by flood water.
In the southern part of the Peloponnetian peninsula, heavy winds caused a strong seafaring.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens instructs people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The mission calls for the monitoring of weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or median, brings with it heavy rains and even floods.
According to a study published in 2011, medicans occur only once or two years throughout the world, typically on the roads of the September to October when the temperature of the sea is still high.
The current storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing to go north and towards Europe.
There have also been many refugee camps in Greece, such as Lesboks.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
In the summer, areas that have been destroyed by earths in the environment of Athens are also under the storm.
In Greece, my medium was also jogging last November.
We don't have to go to the sea now, but we still have flights on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on vacation in the Greek islands at the time of the storm.
The journeys to the sea will be cancelled, and even when walking, caution will be taken not to fly blocks or other loose goods on top of the storm.
Such guides have been distributed to a fair 3 500 Greece, through solar travel to a holiday Finnish weekend.
The instructions will be needed, as even the Zorbas storm, which is most scary, has been predicted to narrow down the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Kreeta, wind speed may rise in the woodwork for up to 45 meters per second.
It's the rains that make the weather more hostile.
All passengers travelling from Finland via solar and Tui to Greece who have reported their telephone numbers have been warned by travelers about the harsh wind by SMS.
But in the air, the sun and the heat
According to Inka Ikosen, the experts on communication of solar travel on Saturday nights, by the beginning of the day, the worst resorts have been avoided.
For example, flights have landed and rose according to normal schedule.
Of course, we've been monitoring the situation all the time.
Security, we'll go ahead.
I supported the media operator Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We're always in touch with our staff.
At least Kreeta was still calm, she told me about the beginning of the evening on Saturday.
At present, there are 1 500 Finnish travelers in the most popular Greek islands, i.e. Rodods and Kreeta.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm in the island of Kos will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodods had mocked the sun and the temperature was 27 degrees in pain, says Ikonen of the sun travels.
Zorbaksen has been expected to become Turkey's next juncture, although slightly reduced.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked for example the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tui, Schroderus says.
In Shirley Karvinen and Janni Hussi, completely identical evenings in the missifinal, so they react to the situation.
Media person and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived to Miss Finland’s Financial Saturday in open-minded evening dress.
Hussi tells me she's got a dress from Messlew.
I went out and I decided to trust professionals who found me a great dress for this night, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress had also been chosen by the runner Shirley Karvinen.
The twins also noticed their uniforms and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put on a plane.
The Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet drinker, and he talks about the stars coming in.
Hussi's got a fresh move behind her because she moved from Kampi to Jukkasä Island on Friday.
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
The essential thing is that there's a private office in the new apartment, Hussi's mind.
Before he moved, Hussi was alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only at a week's hotel without leaving.
When the stress broke down, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really good, Hussi tells me.
The behaviour of Shirley Karvise in the plane attracted a lot of attention - collected the curious eyes of the pensioners
The journalist and Miss Shirly Karvinen of 2016 told Miss Finland on the red carpet that she had enough to do with radio trains and Love Island Finland.
Even the speed has been sufficient for Karvinen to arrive to the finals directly from Finnair’s flight.
I made out and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
At night change at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he pulled his makeup out among the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted fellow travelers ’ attention.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
It was fun to make makeup, at least for the rest of us.
He's flying to Spain once a week.
At a time, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen reports that he enjoyed his plague as the drunkard of Love Island Finland.
He describes the experience he's had so far to stop.
Karvinen tells me that he's been going to jail for singles on Friday.
It's kind of really raw.
They're people's real feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of single people.
How am I supposed to dress up for polyps?
Three perfect examples
Classic clothing is clothing that acts in different costumes from season to season.
Often, classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals fit.
A few years ago, over-polve boots rose into the shock shoes of the autumn and winter season have not left anything.
According to their name, the boots above the knee are repeated in style from year to year and from sesong to year.
The showy boots share the views of the users, but the courageous model is worth trying, well - boldly.
In fact, the over-polves are actually suitable for any housing gatherings.
Well, it's a tail, a lace, a hefty, or a trick, and the boots have a smooth leather or artificial leather surface.
The long boots look good in the holidays as well as in the everydays.
Black over-poln boots fit well even for hempous housing gatherings.
They properly balance the femaleity of a pink, flowery tooth and hempy, muzzle needle.
Rikas but autumn-style beauty with romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retrohexious housing is produced from a long copper-brown velvet dress, polyp, visible earrings and a rivet bag.
Even though there is a certain sensitivity in the over-polve boots, they are perfectly suitable for tyre scarring in combination with the t-shirt, long shorts and trendy boxing.
It's pretty easy, and it's still so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers, the city of Espoo to inform.
Otaniemi’s robot cars play a role in the role of the bus simulator, as next spring’s area is intended to launch traffic on a robot bus.
The project will develop and pilot robot vehicle traffic throughout the year and test the technical functioning of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
We'll find out how robot cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotbus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says transport manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time robot cars travel completely automatically in other transport areas without special transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles shall always be borne by an auxiliary passenger on board.
The vehicles sense their environment at all times on several sensors and assess whether the road is free.
If it is not, they interpret whether there is an obstacle to the vehicle, the bicycle or, for example, the snowboard, explains Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robot transport.
Robot cars travel throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesdays from 13 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., Wednesdays 10-15 p.m. and Thursdays 10-15 p.m.
Robot cars stop by six stops along the route and take passengers.
The stops of the robot cars are identified by the parking marks.
The best way to get into the car is from the parking lot on Otakaar, number 1.
The mokoma band's bass fell from the stage between the gig and injured
The Mokoma group will inform the public about the unexpected situation on their Facebook page in the Tampere Pakkahouse fair.
The Mokoma group’s gig in Tampere’s Packroom received a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell from the stage with its performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song tonight.
The hapless wrist broke.
The band will inform you on its Facebook page.
"We're in life!"
He tripped in the packroom last night in the last song and broke his wrists.
Let's hope for a quick recovery to the metal brother!
The rest of the work on the tour is handled by reserve management, reads on the pages.
Mokoma fans are concerned about the photo update, where the bassist-Santtu sleeps in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was quite a worry how bad it happened.
The relief is great, the bones will heal, fortunately, over time.
Tseppy and quick recovery to Santu and good tour for the rest of the band plus the tuurer!
And thanks for last night, it was a great job, but you promise not to finish such a strong drama job in the future?
Police were in charge of hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
On Fridays and Saturdays with Metsähallitus and Finland’s hunting centre in Northern Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department squad members reported in social media on Saturday.
The main weight of supervision was the legality and authority of hunting.
A hunting card was checked for each hunter and a hunting permit required by the State.
In addition, the permits for hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of self-loading weapons used in channel printing were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter was found in connection with the inspection, without a required hunting permit.
The hunter was assigned 12 days' fines for unauthorized requests.
In addition, the police blew up 133 drivers and two of them are suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine procedure, a police procedure.
In conclusion, hunters are very well bound by hunting.
Many hunters were surprised to control.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
The Eastern Finnish police department will continue hunting in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The mute goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai MITKNEN (Kok.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the choice of quota refugees to Finland.
In Finland this year, it has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps.
Election trips are usually made a few times a year and there are representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey for interviews.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) first selects vulnerable people under the condition.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly fragile position in refugee camps, such as single parents, disabled people and sick people, women and children.
More people are selected for the future group of people in Finland than there are in the quota because, for various reasons, in practice, part will not come.
On its way, Mr Soylu and the Syrian border NGOs, the Turkish Minister for the Interior will also meet on their way.
There is also Ilkka Salmi, Head of the Ministry of Interior.
I'm talking about raising the quota.
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, there have been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 years, but no agreement has been reached on raising it since then.
The assembly has supported the increase in the quota, but the last project has fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centr.) recently presented an increase in the quota gradually to 1 500 to 2 000 people per year.
During this period of the regime, a late visit is the first one the Minister of the Interior will make on the ground to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Ministers of Interior Petter Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risiko (Kok.) will be able to move to their new tasks before the visits were organised.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 per refugee in particular from the EU.
Now, let's go to the hacks and don't know if to cry or laugh anymore.
Last Saturday, the Karelian news about a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill originally prohibited the holding of all animals not specifically authorised by the Ministerial Regulations as productive animals, pets or otherwise of business.
In other words, all animals other than those mentioned in the Regulation are essentially prohibited.
If the bill becomes legal, it would mean that we are rejecting a general principle in Western Democrats that the law specifically prohibits action that endangers the security of society or a good way.
We are now in the process of laying down, in principle, a prohibition on all activities which are not specifically authorised by law or regulation.
This change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business and nothing else, before it has been adopted by an acceptable law or regulation.
In general, the government's activities in the preparation of laws have been weak.
If we are now going to the road that originally in Finland everything is prohibited, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't think the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But the legislative project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but it can at least accept such a 'no' procedure, which is not permitted by law or regulation.
I hope we can find a reasonable minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legal project.
Meti Forssell tip: autumn's four trendiest skirts
The trend of this fall comes in snake tissues.
It looks particularly good in the skirts.
Combine the snake-flowered skirt into paired upper parts, such as half or standard t-shirt, so that the size remains elegant.
This fall, the silk appears rich and especially silk skirt is one of the most trendy clothing pieces in the season.
Combine a fine silk skirt with a fine top of a woman or relax as a pair of needles.
You can play with a silk tooth more bravely and throw in your legs, for example, jocks or autumn trendy shoes, cowboy-boots.
It doesn't matter whether it's grey, brown or multiply, all square skirts now belong to each woman's black have clothes.
Be courageous in combining different colors with each other and play with the screw section on the upper part of the different sizes.
For example, the combination of the rosemary and the ball tissue is beautiful.
Insymmetric beads are a breeze from the light of summer, which can be taken to autumn.
The esymmetric pearl is also a womanly and playful and ideally suited for everyday life as well as for celebration.

The Zorba storm that blew up in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned in particular the sailors, fishermen and farmers in the Greek storm, writing CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
The disaster and emergency authorities called on citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that the internet is functional, so that people can receive current updates to the situation, reports Anadolo Time at the local news office.
People have been invited to stay home and away from windows and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.

In Greece, red weather warnings
On Saturday, the Greek Air Science Service gave a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesus, Ionian Islands, Kyklid and Kreeta.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greek travel agencies warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Athenian Embassy also published a storm warning.
Travelers were invited to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago, when I contacted you, there was a lot of wind and it rained.
The people were very calm, the communication manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui's travel agency told STT on Saturday.
The situation was described by Aaltonen as similar on Saturday night.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from Finns in need.
In Greece, several ports did not operate on Saturday, reported Amna, the local news office.
The boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, reported to STT.
According to the Finnish Athenian embassy, temporary interferences were expected for air and shipping.
Finnair was told that the weather situation is being monitored actively on Saturday.
Kimi Räikkönen made a reason for Mercedes' superior to Ferrari.
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was admitted that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too hard at the time of Russian gp.
However, there is no reason for panicking in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver’s assessment.
They were just faster than we were, but nothing huge is going on.
Our car was the best in time all weekend for the time, but they were just too fast, so they were a quarter of their stablemate Sebastian Vettel and the clearly left of the Mercedes crisis, Räikkönen said.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
It was asked what a sudden fall from Mercedes’s ride is right.
They seem to go faster than we do... as simple as that.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, rare sweets were seen with regard to the coming winter of Räikkösen in Sauber.
The seventh Charles Leclerc replacement for Ferrari next season was, and the last time session was also Marcus Ericsson.
For the Swedish driver, the tenth place of departure is the best for over three years.
And while in the second driving session five drivers left completely behind, the outcome was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to the future of Räikkös?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been big.
Next year, there's a different story, so let's see.
That's where Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teperi: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erka Teper's match at Stutttgart's evening made his way through plain marks.
The Germans were more involved in the ring, but they didn't get any good hits.
Clearly more far-reaching, Helenius controlled the match with its hard series, which found well.
Finnish was also clearly better in physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper directly on the left.
The hit was so hard that a cop in front of the home audience wasn't even trying to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was quite moderate.
At first, he congratulated the public on the good mood and opponents it created.
Then he changed his tongue into Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish incentives.
We took the belt today.
Helenius was happy right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helenius' career.
It might even be possible to get to the World Cup match, Helenius commented on the evening press before the match.
Instead, the killing might have made up the whole boxing career.
Of course it's come to mind.
Helenius, 34 years old, admitted before the Teper scene.
The number of victims of Indonesia’s disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian magazine, the Vice President of the country calls for a clear rise in the victim's population.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kallan, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Severe circumstances
Saviours are looking for trapped ones, as well as dead people from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please from the port city and its neighbourhood from Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Prayer, and there is no clarity about the situation in Donggala.
Hundreds of people are missing, and about 540 have been injured.
There are still people in the ranges who haven't been able to get them out.
For example, a hotel named Roa Roa in Palu has fallen.
Saviourers tell us that they have heard screams of people trapped in ruins, but the lack of derailment has delayed the start of rescue.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo has ordered an army to rescue and mutilation.
The army and its equipment are needed, as electricity and communications in the disaster area are intertwined in many places.
Fuel reserves are also getting worse.
Miss Suomi’s vague response and long reflection caused by the laughing milk
Billnäs in Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview round, a question was asked to each of the missionaries.
The finalists raised the question of the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist of six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, with a vague answer, had sweet but kind laughs at the present audience.
The question to Anttikoske had come through Facebook.
The user, Pirkko-Ella, wanted to know what was the latest book ever written by a missionary.
Anttikoski thought about his answer to the good news before he began to doubt.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read... Anttikoski said he'd think.
At the time of the laugh, Anttikoski continued his reply:
The last book I've read is...
I've been reading books in school!
Must be some kind of economic science.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a crack of applause from the audience, in the form of a smile.
In the past, Anttikoski, who did not want to pose in underwear, was distracted by his principle.
In 2018, Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00, when the crown is abandoned last year by Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm.
Sike's ome-peacock takes the tongue by its time
This recipe is for you with good, acidic apples from behind you, as the domestic apple is at the store at shocking prices.
Maybe you'll have to buy a pear, even though time for many people is already growing up in that pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if the pear does not want to be bought.
The taste is, of course, more versatile if it rains into cake as well as its pear.
The shell of apples and pears and remove the ejaculations.
Squirrel.
You can lock it up in the ceiling.
Stir the eggs and sugar into the foam and then add corn flour to the foam and butter.
Combine corn starch, i.e. maize and bread powder and add to magic.
More almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Bread bread bourbon with bread paper, simmer 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the goat and spread the pear slices on the sugar.
It reads half of the magic on top of the pear slices and the apple blocks on top of the magic.
The end of the spelling magically over the apple blocks.
Cook at 180° in the oven for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let it cool down in a goat and then cancel it to the serving wings.
Just cut the cake and cool it down.
The cake is fragile in its structure and is easily broken because there are mantle and corn flours in the dough that do not have gluten.

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes man popular, charismatic, or admire?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolity" that are composed of a little different features: generally attractive coolity and, in this respect, opposite dissidentity.
In the illustration of the scientists, attractively cool people had many socially desirable features: they were outward, friendly, peaceful, and qualified.
For dissidents, however, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion, and a break.
They were thirsting for experiences, and they only cared little about external assessments.
Both types shared a good sense of self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of toughness on top of no longer cool: a high status in teenage age may not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is how the U.S. study published in 2014 in Child Development.
Young people who were dating early, partying, looking for good-looking gangs and seeking favor from others, had an increased risk of using drugs and getting into crime when they were young.
In their personal relationships, they were less well than once became increasingly noticeable by their peers.
The high-stationed message lock trucks, signboxes or watches don't make man a cool or, at least, a genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in August in Social Psychological and Personality Science, most of the people were best placed to make friends with their usual market shirts than with those wearing their brandy shirts, despite the fact that most of them chose to pick a sign shirt at the time they were getting acquainted.
If you're at the Greek holiday island, be careful!
There's a storm of terror going on in there. The weather alarm screams red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, water can rain as much as Finland's average over six months.
The Zorbas storm hits Greece during the weekend.
Plan to stay in the Peloponnesus, the Ionian islands, the Cyclaves or the Kreeta area.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Athens Embassy reports it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has given regions red weather warnings.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service in the Foreca blog.
According to the storm’s toughest hips are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to comparison, Finland from the first week of the fall of the Kusma storm blew its hardest at a fair 31-foot radius in seconds.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
A weekend in southern Greece can be over 300 millimetres of water.
It is approximately half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has distributed a video of storm development on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize men's death in Love Island Finland -Anku?
Showing with confusing Youtube videos
It is rare to know that in the Love Island Finland series, several men's dying beauty Anku will also appear on strange YouTube videos published in 2010.
With videos, Anku advises ascators to prepare for the old paper roll in the black market.
Anku also shows her hearty style of how her tights can be ascared with silk, with the right laces growing.
Now, let's make Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a little surprising way, Anku suggests and presents sawdust, pantyhose, and the seeds of the rosary that he makes on the bridge.
You can watch videos from under or from Anku Youtube.
Captain Bottas was shaking and biting adrenaline in Sotsh, is he going to help Hamilton on Sunday?
Valteri Bottas was shaking for a little more than ten minutes after the Russian gp's stake in the place where he was in front of the media.
A fine round of Mercedes’ first star Lewis Hamilton, and I'm sure it was vital for the Finns who gathered this season.
It's a nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the round of the settlement.
I feel good, I'm still shaking, Bettis figured it out.
I've only been in a pole once this year, in Austria (in the middle of nowhere), so time has passed.
This track has been good to me before, and I have once again received good tours.
It is not easy to bypass the Soth track, so the departure is particularly big.
And, of course, Bottas was able to respond to the whining, whether he was going to win tomorrow, or whether he would be facing the Jesus of Hamilton approaching the MM title.
My starting point for the race is definitely the fact that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pole, Bottas did.
But as a stable, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis's lead, Sebastian Vettel, is pretty big, and it's very big for me, so keep it in mind.
Let's see what's going on, Battas, though.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottatta after the drive, and Mercedes’ stable boss Toto Wolff also tasted.
Lewis had a plan to win the Valtter, but he couldn't do it in a standing corner.
The master knows he has to tear everything apart to win Lewis.
And he was so loaded that the adrenaline bit out of his ears, Wolff rang.
To ask if he would give Bottak and Hamilton to drive the exterminator, Wolff answered his argument.
We'll talk tomorrow morning, see how the race goes.
Keteeteinen Erno Kinnunen achieved the title of the Finnish championship
The SM series ended rarely.
I don't think the brothers have ever ended up being Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by the Tusulas Eerik and Henrik St. Peternen in a final round driven around Turku and Salo, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen, the Kiteiteist, ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final competition sealed him from the SM4 category of Finnish championship cars.
At Honda Civil, Kinnune and the map reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku partial competition, because the starting points were clear: the investment top team would guarantee an SM label.
In the darkness of Friday night, the twins were forced to give a balance when some of the extra lights were betrayed by another special test.
You know, it's got to go a little blind on that one, but it's a third piece of shit.
In a situation like that, it's not right to be rubbed off.
On Saturday, only another set was followed by Jussi Tepo, Kinnunen told me.
Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to pull their troops away.
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Mualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Mualem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN speech, Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end to the seven years of war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
On Friday in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that in October, the Syrian meeting was planned to be attended by the French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the highest court judge on TV
The Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blassey Ford, accused of harassment, were given an exceptionally large number of people at the border of the Roses.
In the United States, at least 20 million people received the appointment of the Supreme Court Judge with full power on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Professor Blasey Ford of California, accused of harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee telling his story.
According to preliminary findings, a total of 20.4 million viewers were followed by six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
To increase their online consultation, millions more followed.
NBC reported that livestriim was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that he had made his annual record with 8.2 million live broadcasts.
The CNN figure rises more than 10 million when it is calculated through Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got 8.0 million to start.
Digital startups are the channels' own, TV viewers come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but in any case they are dizzy.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, over 20 million viewers usually only enjoy sports games and large Oscar and Grammy gala in the entertainment world as well as random political events such as presidential speeches and presidential elections in 2016.
The US's most viewed annual program, the American football league for the NFL finals Super Bowl, is a trip.
This year Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people across the Roses to the NBC channel.
According to Nielsen, the first speech by Trump to Congress last year saw a total of nearly 48 million people and a fair 30 million civil servants.
It's a top priority.
The Supreme Court's appointment is an extremely important case in the United States, since the posts are life-long.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans succeeded in preventing President Barack Obama from appointing him as a successor.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that this year he would retire.
Kennedy was a Republican President named Ronald Reagan, but on a number of questions he was a so-called 'Vapanese', whose voice could determine the position of the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of abortion law and sexual minority rights and, for example, in 2015 he resolved, for example, with his vote that the same sex had acquired marriage law in the whole of the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his canes.
His choice of the highest court may be locked down by decades of conservative power.
Children have the right to information to parents
Only parents under 10 years of age see the health data of their children in the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
At first, the situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health data or recipes of young children.
A temporary-descripted correction was introduced in the autumn 2016 for people under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be repaired, but it has been amazing for a long time.
Now the repairs are on the books in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a dead end.
Then the idea of the painting is to press the button: once the pipe is held, it will be opened.
Of course, the child can show his parents his information if he has a bank identification or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds do you have?
The personal card is paid and the 10-year-olds are not even allowed.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of the fourth grade school unless they are requested as a result.
It is not so much about parents' rights as it is about children's rights.
It is extremely important for parents to be involved in the care of the child.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be ensured.
Even underage children can have family situations where all things are not freely talkable.
They often relate to sexual health, which is deeply relevant to human rights in the area of free care.
In the United States, the F.B.I. started doing harassment charges on Kavanaugh.
According to the American media, the FBI is investigating at least two women's harassment charges.
Another woman was previously consulted by the Senate Committee on Justice this week.
Kavanaugh has objected to allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his study days.
President of the United States Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate's judicial committee.
I don't want the investigation to last another week.
According to Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation into a limited investigation, and it doesn't necessarily become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaan.
The attached smuggler continued to pullicize with the chamber.
The police tell me that they put a man in a police prison for "sorry."
The police were subject to a suspected assault threat on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The official will inform you of a case that started when a man of a fair 30-year-old had a violent battle at the center restaurant.
The man assaulted another customer within the nutrition movement.
This led to the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the warrior attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to cut him loose, he still hit him.
The trial of trinitarian abuse led to the police calling.
Partio caught him and took Kajaan to the police station, the police will.
The suspect continued to be aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police are telling me that they've put a man in a police prison and he's put a man in peace.
He's a suspect in three assaults and violent opposition to a civil servant.
Assistance organisations are preparing to begin work on the Indonesian Sulawes - "The rest of the water is the most urgent"
The UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, explains Kirsi Haru, the Information Manager of Finland Unicef.
The local authorities are conducting rescue work, but the need for additional aid is already apparent at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency capability, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the city of Sulawes rescue operations are in progress, but the situation in Donggala is slightly more northern.
There are still places where contacts do not work.
Granting activities are difficult because roads are over, says Haru.
The buildings are often light-headed by Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is huge.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need protection from the beginning, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, people are able to offer water-cleaning tablets, which Unicefill also has in storage.
The aim is to improve water systems as soon as possible, but in case of emergency, water is transported first, for example by means of trucks.
In crisis situations, many children will have to get rid of their parents.
The search for family members and the pooling of families is one part of Unicef's task field.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is also being organised as part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds collected in the past will be used for emergency aid.
But, among other things, Unicef has already begun a fundraiser to help the victims of the earthquake in Indonesia and the victims of the tsunami.
Bill Elon Musk, the President of Tesla's Board of Directors, will end the fines of $20 million on the Wi-Fi.
Elon Musk, founder of space and electric vehicles companies, avoid fraud in agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Bill Elon Musk will end his duties as Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors and will agree to $20 million fines.
The Musk will be removed from the task as part of the agreement he entered into with the US Securities Regulatory Authority.
By matching the Musk to avoid fraud.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened the Musketeer of securities fraud because of his twits sent in August.
The Musk wrote that he prepared an electric car company to pull Tesla out of the stock exchange, which brought the company's stock exchange to a rapid rise.
According to the agreement, Musk must not be acting as Chairman of the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Teslan must appoint a new "independent member" to his government and take over two "independent leaders".
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.
The Musk can still continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to the personal fines of USD 20 million Muski, Tesla will also be required to pay the 20 million equivalent fines to the financial supervisor.
Twists led investors wrong
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets led investors and Tesla’ shareholders to the wrong.
Musk claimed that he would have ensured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private stock company.
According to the billionaires, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange at a stock price of $420.
Tesla’s share rate increased by more than 10 per cent per day after the spindles, but decreased later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims had no basis.
According to the administrator, he had not actually negotiated his claims for funding.
Moreover, he had not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other board of directors or the board of companies.
On Friday this week, the rate fell by 14 per cent when SEC announced a fraud charge.
The new agreement is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The last sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the clocks of the judge do not ring when the wise ones do not move.
It's a technical flaw.
The tower of the court hall in Helsinki has stopped.
The Visas are showing us at 12:00.
It's like the average horror story: even when the church's crypta is known to be manic and the worms would go for it.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped because of the technical reason: it has broken.
It has been seen by a repairer, but some of it has broken and is expected to have a new part, says Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
The accounts state that the last sentence is not a reason to stop the clock.
Jamsen tells me the church watches don't ring because of the fault.
