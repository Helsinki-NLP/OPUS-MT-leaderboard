Say hello to Jim.
We're only doing what we're told to do.
Tom doesn't like socializing.
I don't know what to do with him.
He's a desperate student.
This guy's definitely a bachelor.
Where are they?
I didn't read it.
Why does it bother you?
Don't you ever give up?
Is there an English-Japan dictionary on the shelf?
The older I get, the less I understand.
It's not bad.
They had to start off.
Two days ago, this wind blew.
I don't speak French well enough!
Why me?
I know where Tom was born.
I don't have a very good dictionary.
Didn't I warn you?
I should have said yes.
Grammetics are very difficult.
I can run.
Congratulations.
A friend of mine is beautiful.
Are you doing this?
It was too hard to solve him.
You have to do it right now.
What else do we need to be happy about?
What's wrong with it?

That's an interesting offer.
How'd it get there?
I'm really tired right now.
I'm not trying to be lazy.
Bye.
We don't need him.
Did you have fun last night?
Why didn't you run for this job?
It's a fish.
Give me the report.
Hello.
The chicken hasn't cooked.
If you want.
I'm flying back to Boston.
The buses go every ten minutes.

I like your village.
Can I ask you a favor?
You've seen what I'm capable of.
It's pretty clear to me that's the truth.
Can I have your attention?
Do you think Tom's lying to us?
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
I'll stay until tonight.
We can still do that.
Animal meat, please.
Don't you have a job to do?
Tom's already there.
She chose a good woman.
He was sitting on the bed.
This flower is the most beautiful of all flowers.
Who wins?
Looks like the second floor is a bank account.
I remember that.
Where did you go to school?
Good night, everybody.
I won't do it again.
Who brought this?
If it rains tomorrow, I won't.
The wine's in the glass.
I often go to the movies.
Look at the moon.
I think I added too much sugar.
Finally!
Did you see that sunrise?
It was my finger.
Faith does wonders!
It meant a lot to me.
You can't do this anymore.

I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Do you know anyone named Tom?
I went to the hospital.
What just happened?
Tom wanted it to be a surprise.
I'm a woman.
I bet Tom can speak French.
The evidence does not support the claim.
What am I supposed to say?
Excuse me...
What school did you go to?
I have two cousins.
I know I need to sleep eight hours a day, but I usually sleep less.

Are you joining our club?
Every voice is important.
He's three years older than me.
You don't want to know.
How much does it cost?
I'm glad it suits you.
Tom didn't wash his mind.
Someone told me I shouldn't trust you.
I had lunch two and a half hours ago.
Tatoeba is a multilingual dictionary.
Besides you, I don't have any real friends.
Tom couldn't answer my questions.
What's the problem?
As far back as I can remember, I've always had thoughts and ideas that seemed to make me unique at that time.
I was a little hungry.
You can start.
Will you take it?
Dad's going to work.
It's all right. It's all right.
These tickets aren't mine.
Tom's at lunch.
Give me my wallet back.
This is a very big social problem.
I forgot my vocabulary on the bottom floor.
Come on.
I didn't think you'd mind.
Don't move!
Saturday is the last day of the week.
He lives near the beach.
It's a long story.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
What do you mean?
Harder.
Tom is very important.
I want to live in Brazil.
It's more like a small room.
They're probably American.
Now I'm sad.
It's basically what we want.
Please hurry.
I want ice cream.
Any questions?
Is that what Tom's been telling you?
Just kidding.
I'm Chinese.
Tom and Mary made piparko-goats.
So cute!
Is that all right with you?
Tom likes you.
We knew it.
Can I cancel the ticket?
Tom wants to open his own restaurant.
I remember that.
Please don't stop.
Tom's coming with you.
Tom's friendly.
He's a little man.
I have to go to bed.
Why would Tom want to see Mary?
Did anyone miss me?
Was that interesting?
Life is beautiful.
I'm sorry I didn't work hard when I was a kid.
You've got a concussion.
What happened?
Tom was trying to hide his excitement.
Earth's flat.
How old were your kids when you moved to Boston?
I don't understand why you're so worried.
How is this supposed to work?
I've only been there once.
I want a book.
What's ahead of you?
Please hurry!
We walk between lemon trees.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
I don't know.
Good evening.
Do I have to pay you back?

He's a good boy, and that's why I like him.
I told you Tom was ready.
I have two eyes.
He's got a lovely voice.
Can you make me a copy?
It's a tough decision.
I'll help you in a few minutes.
I live in Japan.
Did they get it?
I'm tired and I want to sleep.
I don't like living alone.
I need to help Tom clean his room.
Do you think I still love her?
I'm having lunch with my sister right now.
I'm tired and I want to go home.
I drink water in the kitchen.
Please don't apologize.
There are several factors.
Tom didn't look very happy.
I'm done.
I want a sword like this here!
Tom said he had to leave.
Of course!
Tom tried to kill himself.
Probably.

We've got enough to eat.
I can run.
Are you in favour or against this proposal?
Do you see that?
As soon as Mary broke up with Tomi, John with roses was in front of her door.
I have a cat and a dog, and the cat is black, and the dog is white.
Kiss me.
I wish you were with me.
I don't want to cause any more trouble.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm a volunteer.
Help me!
It's safer to stay here.
Hi, it's Mike.
They're amazing.

Tom planted his garden flowers.
Why aren't you at college?
Your death is painless.
I'm not bitter.
My brother gave me a lovely doll.
I have questions.
Many people like to travel.
Tom lied about his grades.
This clock is broken.
Tell me.
I'm afraid Tom's not here.
A discussion based on mutual respect.
It made me cry.
Tom died last year.
The weather forecast says it's clouded tomorrow.
I didn't say hello.
This is where Tom died.
I was told I wouldn't touch it.
Thanks!
I saw what you were doing.
I'm the only one living in Urumq with my children.
I know what it's about.
Did you cook cake?
I want an apple.
The sun is red.
Listen!
Tom didn't want to lose.
As we looked at the sky, the river seemed like a giant snake.
I miss my cat.
I'm telling the truth.
They refused to talk to me despite my sincere prayer.
I won!
Life is never easy.
There are enough guests in the room.
It's a hot day.
The boy throws one stone.
Hey, Meg, how you doing?
How are you?
It's not an easy question.
I'm fine.
They're not gonna hurt you.

I just want to go home to the bath and then sleep.
You don't even have a car.
I have three kids.
Can I have a drink?
At the first sight, he seemed kind and tender.
Hello?
You owe me one beer.
We live in peace.
If I can't write anymore, I don't want to live anymore.
Make it quick.
They're very good.
Please come and see me from time to time.
Tom hopes to inherit a lot of money after his mother's death.
Wow!
You're a fast learner.
I can handle this myself.
Have a good weekend.
Tell me about it, I'm a big ear.
He didn't have a pen.
Wash yourself.
John sent me a German letter.
If Tom hadn't saved you, you'd be dead.
I don't speak Irish.
Tom doesn't often do his homework before dinner.
You have a fever.
This book is about overweight.
Tom, I'll never leave you.
I don't have much time.
You would've liked Boston.
Wherever I don't look, there's only sand and sand.
I got a car.
Try again.
Maybe Tom deserved it.

He agreed to her.
People with trees can't tolerate them if they're pathetic.
I would like to thank you for all the help you can offer him.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
I have a blue house.
He nodded with encouragement.
Tom held Mari in his arms.
Do you need a drink of wine?
Tom rarely goes to church.
Show me your hand.
What have they done?
Tom won't call back until the meeting's over.
Welcome!
Get lost.
Natural sciences are more difficult than social sciences.

What train are you on?
I don't have any real friends but you.
I want more money.
Thank you for your kindness.
I passed out.
Sleep a little while if you can.
The bus leaves every ten minutes.
Sam kept his eyes open.
I'm a social worker.
Is that love?
Looks like you've forgotten your original goal.
You broke your arm.
Tom didn't want Mari to call him all the time.
I don't have time for vacation.
The killer's still out there.
Mary's maiden name is Jackson.
To friendship!
I'm reading the book.
He moved to Germany.
I'm from Skopje.
Did you want something?
We need a car.
I want more beer.
This house is too big for us.
Would you sing me a song of the dances?
I wasn't quite sure about that.
What do you want to drink?
Tom arrived too late.
Sometimes after the melts, it floods the river.
I don't need a bed.
What's your mother's name?
How could I even trust you?
I'm not afraid of cold, but I can't stand heat.
Your critic has no basis.
Are we going to eat outside tonight?
Keep it.
If you lend someone $20 and never see this person again, then probably it was worth it.
Where are you from?
It sounds like a Hollywood movie.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'd like a map of the city, please.
I'll start tomorrow.
Ask him his name.
It was really terrible.
He didn't have any pencils.
What am I eating?
If you want to be loved, love!
I gotta go.
Thank you!
I'll call you after lunch.
Tom wanted a bigger discount.
It's a beautiful town.
Everything's ready.
How old are you?
I'm happy.
Good afternoon!
I watched TV instead of learning.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Can you lock the door?
I think we should call the police.
What are your thoughts?
Hey, don't get me involved in this.
I'm afraid it might hurt Tom.
I decided to go there.
Many friends came from my youth.
You're falling.
Ooh!
It is clear that no one has any new proposals.
Do you eat rice every day?
I don't like your proposal.
Who's Emily?
Maybe I'll see you around.
Whose friend is he?
How many calories are in a hundred grams?
Hope is not a strategy.
When I get bored, bad things start to happen.
My eyes don't work very well anymore.
Love loves love.
They broke into their house yesterday.
