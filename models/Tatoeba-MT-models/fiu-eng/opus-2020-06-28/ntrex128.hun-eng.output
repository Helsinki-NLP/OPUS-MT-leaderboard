Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves in the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were surprised at the proposal that their address would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament of Wales).
The ritual came after the emergence, the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) should be the Wales Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Now, representatives of different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title can make them a name.
According to one of the Labour Party representatives, the group is concerned that their new name will cry for the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
It's not for our Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, twp is a one-time twp, and pwp means kaka.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the whole section is "satisfied" and therefore proposes alternatives.
One of the conservatives said that his group "opened" for the change of names, but he noted that it was only a jump from the MWP to the Muppet.
Here it is worth noting that the word "w" in the Welsh language is similar to the word "u" in the yorkshire English, i.e. "mWP".
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law for the roll-over change is as follows: "The final decision, of course, is in the hands of Members of the National Assembly as regards the titles for the names of the members of the National Assembly."
Law 2017 governing the administration of Wales allowed the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation that proposed the inclusion of the name of Parliament in Wales and which received broad support.
With regard to the address of the Members, the Commission preferred the title of the Welsh Parliament Member and itsbbreviation of the WMP, but the public consultation supported the alternative of MWP.
Members come up with new alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the president of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, whose proposal for a law on change of names should be submitted in the coming weeks.
The law on reforms will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly at other points, including the disqualification of Members and the structure of the Commission.
In the matter of their title, Members will be able to draw their final votes when discussing the draft law.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, citizens vote to change the country's name to "The Republic of Macedon".
The aim of the referendum is to make a point to neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia, at the end of a decade of debate.
Athens has long said that, in essence, with its northern neighbour’s name, it has supported territorial demand and has repeatedly objected to its EU and NATO recruitment request.
President Gjorge Ivanov Macedón himself objects to the referendum on the change in name, and he does not participate in this.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a compromise that they need to make for their EU and NATO accession.
Harlem churches have been silenced in a difficult situation, including St. Martin's bells
“ More importantly, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” says Adams.
- Not one of them today."
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“ People have different ways of socializing these days, ” he says.
- Bars are no longer the community days where people go out every day."
As far as churches are concerned, Adams is concerned that the sale of the church property will not replace the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will hold back where they were going.”
And he added to the place of the churches – residential buildings that also do not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The majority of those who buy housing in these buildings will be white - and this continues to speed up the final closure of churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments would join the community of faith.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the black city – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, the St. Martin one decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out of the temple in the 30s.
followed by a black congregation nearby.
The St. Martin church was taken over by the black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known for running the Harlemi Shopping Street, 125th Street, against black people who are reluctant to market black products.
In 1939 a fire caused serious damage in the building, but during the renovation the bell game was built on the Johnson Reverend led the community to order.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's plebania, proudly referred to as "the berets of the poor".
According to the expert who spoke in July, this bell game is a cultural heritage, a “unprepared, historically important instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world, which was spoken by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had broken to the greater bell game of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
According to merriweather, St. Martin didn't sign anyone.
In St. Martin, in recent months, a complicated situation broke down by the participation of builders and entrepreneurs, who were involved in the secular administration of the church, partly by the Bishop's office.
In July, the governing body of Parocia, the Council of the Community, referred in writing to the Bishop's Office, objecting that the Office would ‘replace the costs’ to the Council, where the Council did not take part in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs who were signed by the Office.
Some members of the community complain about lack of transparency in the area of the Office’s house.
The shark attacked a 13-year-old california boy during cancer deaths
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy during cancer-fishing on the opening day of the cancer season on Saturday in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach Coast in Encinitas before 7:00 in the morning.
Chad Hammel on the San Diego KSWB TV channel told me that his friends spent about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he was told that a boy was crying out for help.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy shouted: “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“ The shoulder was torn up at the key bone, ” she classified Hammel as what she saw when she came to the boy.
– I started screaming to make everyone go out of the water, "There is shark in the water", he added.
The boy was transported to the Rady Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As Captain Larry Giles told the press, sharks have already been detected in the area a few weeks before, but then they found that it was not a species that was dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered trauma on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastal section between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons for 48 hours.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would expand on the British beauty market
The Sainsbury's expert would like to compete with salesmen and large store-style peppers with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
The fall in sales of fashion and household articles will be tested in 11 stores across the chain, as part of an ever increasing return to the UK beauty market of GBP 2,8 billion, and will be published in new stores if successful.
The strengthening of the ticket line is due to the different ways in which the stores try to fill up the shelf surfaces previously carried out by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's told me that he would double his offer to 3000 products, including the representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are now the first to offer.
But the former brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be located in a larger area on brand-specific positions, like those in Boots and similar stores.
The chain is also re-starting the Boutique makeup family, where most of the products are now Vegan – these are being sought by more and more young customers today.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing its appearance at two Sainsbury's stores, one of which was opened in Croydon last week in the south of London, while the other one opens this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
With the spread of online purchases and the transfer of food shopping habits to small local trades, large shops need to make greater efforts to attract customers.
According to the CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more like mixed stores, as the chain of stores tries to introduce more and more services and other products other than food to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl.
Since the two chains were purchased two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened Argos classes in hundreds of stores, as well as some Habitat classes – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition is even more profitable.
The chain has failed its previous experiment with the preservation of beauty and drug classes.
Sainsbury's started a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the debate on the distribution of revenues from the pharmaceutical classes in its stores ended.
The new strategy was born after three years ago that Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical company operating in 281 stores to Celesio, which operated the Lloyds patic chain.
According to the chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy, and in four stores he will offer a wider palette of luxury skin care products with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the trade director of Sainsbury's, said: “We want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by changing the look of our pioneers.
In addition, we also hire qualified staff to advise interested parties.
Our brand offer offers all the needs, the attractive environment and a comfortable place to approach will provide you with an incentive that will boost your shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones "stitched" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the 11 million-dollar agreement
The Dragons Star, Peter Jones, left "stamped" after Holly Willoughby's television broadcaster stopped by an important 11 million important agreements on the trading of lifestyle products to concentrate on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's coat of clothes and accessories.
The company of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand noted by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old programmer reported on Instagram getting out.
Holly Willoughby carefully pulled the matches out of Dragons’ star, Den, Peter Jones, when she left their promising, lifestyle products company at the last minute to focus on her own highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones’ “tombolt”, when he announced during a tense discussion at the headquarters of Jones’s business group in Marlow (Buckinghamshire) on Tuesday, that due to his total new contracts worth 1.5 million pounds, there was no longer enough time left to devote to their joint brand selling home wear and accessories, Truly.
The company of the two celebrities was previously compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets to GBP 11 million.
While the 37-year-old Willoughby reported on Instagram leaving the Trulyt, Jones moved from island to one of his cabins.
One source states: “Truly was far from the most important thing for Holly.
It was intended to be dealt with in the long term, and this will give him his livelihood in the next few decades.
The fact that he got out was a complete surprise for everyone.
It surprised everyone what happened on Tuesday, as the beginning was so close.
In the office of Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods waiting for sale."
According to the experts, the departure of one of the stars of This Morning, one of the United Kingdom's profits, could cost millions of companies from pillows and candles up to clothing and home wear in a range of theocratic amounts and possible slides.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-year-old showkeeper and husband Dan Baldwin spent ten years in close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap.
Willoughby Capp started Truly in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples usually go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product face and take over Ant McPartlin's place as the director of ITV I'm Celebrity's show.
A source close to Jones commented on what happened last night: “We do not want to comment on [Jones] business matters.”
Words spoken, “we fell in love”
He was joking about what criticism he would get from the press for his statement, which some might consider to be "unsponsible" and why he said so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump let you do so much?
– asked Trump in the funny "murders" voice.
- I didn't let anything."
As you noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after the first meeting in June in Singapore Trump welcomed him as a huge step towards North Korea's nuclear weaponry.
However, negotiations on nuclear weapons have been suspended.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea, told the United Nations General Assembly that, as his country sees, the United States does not give birth to the early armed actions of North Korea.
Instead, it is said that the United States will continue to maintain the sanctions for the exercise of pressure.
Trump put it much more optimistic in a campaign discussion.
“ Things are going very well with North Korea, ” he said.
- We were going to have a war with them.
Millions of people would've lost them.
Now we have a very good relationship."
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kimmel have brought positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he was talking in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kimmel.
“It’s not hard to behave freely, but there is no tens of thousands of people out there trying to get in, only two hundred ahead of me,” said Trump, pointing to the group before him.
In Indonesia, hundreds of people have been killed by tsunamis and earthquakes turning up the island.
Indonesia has also rejected the aid of international aid organisations after the earthquake in Lombok.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombardes had to be installed, no disaster at national level has been reported, and this would be a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases it has been said very clearly that there is no need for international assistance, so our situation is a little difficult,” said Summung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a Pa permission-to-ship emergency team, but it is not yet sure that foreigners will be able to participate in the rescues on the ground.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, says that Indonesian agencies are currently carrying out an assessment of the state of the request to see if there is a need to involve international aid organisations.
Despite continued earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to the destructive power of nature.
Although tsunamis were built in Aceh province, in other coastal areas this is not common at all.
The same tsunami signal was valid, the apparent lack of the tsunami’s siren system in Palu has also contributed to the development of a disaster that requires human lives.
Even in the best time between the Indonesian islands, transport can be difficult.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in the Lombards is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before the disaster hit the zone.
President Joko Widodo placed the development of the infrastructure of Indonesia in the centre of his election campaign and did not save the costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government now faces budget deficits before the next year's elections.
In addition, the President must face the constant tensions in Indonesia, since the majority of Muslims began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to be evacuated because of the riots in which Christian and Muslim bands fell into each other with embroidery, bows and arrows on the streets and other weapons of heroism.
Video: The huge equator goal of Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool against Chelsea
At the Premier League match in London, Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with his 89th-minute goal, who didn't lose the Chelsea.
The trap was down to 0-1 when Sturrridge was given from the Chelsea gate about 30 metres from Xherdan Shaqiri.
He put the ball on the left first, then started a huge kick in the side of the gate.
The shot went high over the sixteenth, and went toward the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reached the net above Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get into position because there is always someone like Shaq, who will advance the ball, so I tried to make the best possible position,” said Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com’s question.
"I saw Kante arriving, and I just took it off, and then I didn't think much, and I shot it."
Chelsea drove me to 1-0 in half-time after the Belgian star player Eden Hazard took the lead in 25 minutes.
For the blue battles, Mateo Kovačič passed the ball, then managed to break off the middle course and climb into Liverpool Square.
Kovačič started and got the ball back on the middle course after a quick injection.
Then he began with a beautiful transfer to the sixteenth.
He ran off, and he finally sent the ball with a left shot to the remote corner of Liverpool's gate near Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet Naples on Wednesday at 3 a.m. at the Naples Stadium San Paolo Arena.
Chelsea plays against Videoton on Thursday at 3:00 in London at the UEFA Europe League.
There are 832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami.
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832, reported on Sunday by the local Disaster Agency.
As a result of an earthquake of 7.5 on Friday and the 6 meters high storms following it, more people were buried themselves in the ruins, the spokesperson of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, on a press conference.
The streets of Palu with more than 380 thousand souls are covered by the ruins of the fallen buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of the stabbed woman.
The police launched a murder investigation this morning after a woman was found dead in Birkenhead in Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's body covered with stabs was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was already arrested with murder suspicion.
Police are asking the residents in the area to report to anyone who saw or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still early, but I would like to ask everyone in Birkenhead who was around John Street who might have seen or heard something to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially cab drivers, who may have recorded anything with a camera on board, to find us as well, because he may have relevant information from the point of view of the investigation."
The police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was a birkenhead resident and was found in a real estate.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.
The investigation is under way, and the police are still notifying the victims' relatives.
A cab driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police were informed that no one could enter the building yet, and no one could leave.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't even speak.
The people of the building have just been informed that there may be more than an hour before they can get back into the building.
One cop told someone that the whole building is being treated as a crime scene right now.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
"This is terrible" – he repeated.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon, two police microbuses stayed inside and one more outside.
There were several police officers watching the block within the time frame.
Anyone who has any information, write a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers organisation on 8800 555 111, and refer to the 247.
statue of Parliament Cromwell is the newest victim of the historic novel fever
The exile of the statue could be a poetic justice, for those who followed Cromwell and fanatical puritan had destroyed England’s cultural and church heritage with Taliban enthusiasm.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick's proposal to "be a fool" is an "a attempt to rewrote history".
According to the President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith said: “It was impossible for Oliver Cromwell, who was eventually to become a target for the current discussions on the removal of statues before the Westminster Palace.
During the English civil war, Cromwell did not order and execute the image destruction.
So maybe another Cromwell could fall victim to the actions of Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell appeal reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and it reminds me of a historical form that many people still think should celebrate."
In this connection, Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell may be less than it was at the end of the 19th century, but many still consider Parliament’s defender of external pressure, which, of course, was the monoarchy in his case.
If this picture really is correct, it is still the subject of a historical debate.
However, there is no doubt that this conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century has had an impact on the further course of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person representing one of the sides of this conflict.
And we should celebrate and remember the results of Lord Proctor."
A deadly pig wounded to death by a Chinese farmer
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer on a market in the south-west of China.
Only a man identified as Yuan was found covered with a blood-thirsty borough along the market for the city of Liupanshui of Kujsou, reported the case on Sunday at South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder will have a vaccine for the introduction of pigs in a breeding facility in Xining City, China's Csinghai province, on 30 May 2005.
The man traveled from the nearby Province of Yunnan with his cousin to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, her cousin found her body on the body of the man and discovered that the door with the neighboring pig was open.
According to him, the mouth of the mighty candidate in the pig hole was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation found that the marta of a pig of 200 pounds was actually the owner.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody, and they were marchanged,” said Guiyang Evening News, a relative mentioned only on his last name, Wu.
According to security cameras, Yuan stepped into the pighouse at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killing the man wasn't Yuan or his cousin's property.
The head of the market told Eventing News that the pig was locked up so that no harm would be done in others while the police were investigating the tracks on the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities report that they are currently discussing compensation for the death of a man.
Although not often happens, pigs have been reported before attacking people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a married couple on a massachusettsi farm and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
And ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales pushed a master to his tractor until his wife couldn't alarm him.
After an oregoni farmer was fed up by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer spoke in CBC News about the fact that pigs are generally not prone to attack, but may become aggressive from the taste of blood.
“You're a lot of players.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
Just have to give them respect," he said.
Serious rainfalls in the south-west region of the United States following the hurricane Rosa
The hurricane Rosa is getting weaker as it is expected, as it reaches the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will continue to cause severe rains in the southern parts of Mexico and the United States in the coming days.
The Rosa was hit as a hurricane in category 1 with speeds of 140 km/h at 5 a.m. Sunday morning as a hurricane from Punta Eugenia in Mexico at 620 km south.
Hurricane is expected to be heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone lies above the Pacific and goes westward towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Alsó-Carifornia on Monday, it floods the south-west areas of the United States with a heavy tropical humidity as a tropical storm.
The storm can cause up to 25 cm of rain to some areas of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical couple of approaching low-pressure masses will cause intense rainfalls in the south-west of the days ahead.
Here, 3 to 10 cm of rain can cause sudden floods, floods with debris, and earthquakes in the desert.
The heavy tropical couple can also produce 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in the southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that between 5 and 10 cm in some parts in the south, mainly in Arizona.
There may also be sudden floods, with a rapid fall due to the terrible nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rainfalls, it is not particularly recommended to walk in the desert.
Because of severe rainfalls, canyons can turn into floating rivers, and jitters are accompanied by sudden windfalls and dust clouds at places.
Emerging low-pressure masses can cause serious rainfall in the coasts of Southern California.
It is possible to have a rainfall of 1.5 cm, which can cause minor floods with debris and flat road conditions.
This will be the first raining of the wet season in the region.
Urgent tropical rains can appear in Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, then on Mondays and Tuesdays it also covers wider areas of rainfall.
Serious raining spreads on Tuesday to the Foursar region and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations will be experienced in the United States, as the polar circulators cool down, but tropicals continue to remain quite warm.
This can cause dramatic differences in temperature at short distances.
This is an excellent example of the situation in the central U.S. region on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omara (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is close to 10 degrees.
In the coming days, it is expected that even summer will be warm even in larger areas.
The United States' central and eastern regions are expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25-30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Skills to some parts of the north-west.
The temperature in New York is 25 degrees higher than the average on Tuesday.
According to the long-term weather forecast, the temperature in the eastern parts of the United States is likely to exceed the average temperature until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
A total of over 20 million viewers on six television channels were interested in Brett Kavanaugh and the female who accused him of rape in the eightties, Christine Blassey Ford's testimony.
Meanwhile, the political situation did not resolve, and the broadcasters had to cancel the normal session because of the last Friday screw in place: Senator Jeff Flake was able to use it to get a week from the FBI to investigate the charges.
Ford told his Senate Committee on court cases that 100 percent sure that he was taking Kavanaugh at a high school party and trying to undress him.
In Kavanaugh's passionate testimony, he said that 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
The statements are probably seen by more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday.
Nielsen calculated on average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels providing the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen can easily measure the number of people who watch the shows at work.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are used to being football players or Oscars.
Nielsen stated that the number of Fox News Channel who supported Kavanaugh's appointment was the highest, averaged 5,69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing.
Second place ABC consists of 3,26 million viewers.
CBS 3,1, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN accounted for 2,52 million.
Even after the hearing, the interest didn't decrease.
The main character of the drama Friday was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican Senator's office issued the statement that the senator would put down the box next to Kavanaugh, he was on the CNN and CBS programme on Friday morning, as a loud crowd of protesters receives the lift as he seeks to meet the court committee on the elevator.
He was out there looking at perceek while the crowd was pushing, and CNN broadcasted the scene live.
“Here I am before you,” told the senator a woman.
"Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the public?"
Others shouted: “You have the power to do what not so many women do.”
Flake just said that his office had issued a statement and then, before the elevator door was closed, he added that he would share what he had to say during the hearing with the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting channels were visible hours later, as the Committee will vote on whether or not Kavanaugh's nomination to vote in front of the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he was willing to do so only if the FBI investigates charges against the candidate the next week, as the Democrats in the minority called for.
Flake's discussions with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, on the need have been convinced.
Flake decided to conduct discussions with the Coons and later with other senators.
With Flake's decision, it was obvious that, without an investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of the Brexit with political playplay
In a Sunday interview to the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of planning to leave the European Union of jeopardising the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation with their political play.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservatory Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview directly on the website of May's interview, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of May, Boris Johnson, attacks May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the appeal is to treat the customs duties of Great Britain and the EU as "absurd in full".

Volcana floods Mexico City with ash
The ash from the volcano with Popocatos reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
After the disaster prevention centre requested the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano after the volcanic activity was strengthened and a total of 183 gas and ash records were carried out within 24 hours.
The center has observed several mischiefs and vibrations.
In some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, the windshields of cars are covered by a thin foam.
The geophysics observed an increase in the activities of the volcano south-east from the capital of Mexico to 72 km after an earthquake with a intensity of 7.1 in September 2017 hit the central region of Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police met with separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after an independent party protest with the police, and thousands joined the rival protests on the first anniversary of the breaking referendum of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists dumped them with eggs and paint powder, so that the streets with other tourists were now covered by dense dust paint.
In the later part of the day, further fights took place, during which the police tried to maintain the order with rubber poles.
The fact that we did not forgive the symbolistic independence groups and unit protesters listed behind the "Live Spain" symbol stood against each other for hours.
According to local press reports, 14 people were killed with minor injuries during demonstrations.
The tension is still not reduced in the region of independence, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but which is celebrated by the Catalan separatists on 1 October following a referendum.
The voters fought with a huge majority for the break-up, although the participation rate was rather low, because most of the Union's members have boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when police tried to stop the vote in the polls through aggressive collisions.
The independence groups on Friday were on the street all night to prevent national police demonstration.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the demonstration was ultimately not on the normal route.
According to the 68-year-old Narcis Termes who participated in separatist protests, there is no longer any chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Tavaly was one of the best times of our life.
I saw my parents give me tears of joy, for which we can vote, but now our cause has been compromised."
Although regional elections in December last year have succeeded in achieving a substantial, even if there is little victory, the Catalan independent parties will be able to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most well-known leaders have been called into exile or are waiting for a court to pass judgment on their role in the organisation of referendums and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old car operator who recorded the police protest with his phone, Joan Puig said the conflict was being fired by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he says.
The negotiations have been announced on Saturday by one of the Catalan leaders who have been waiting for prior arrest since last year, Mr Junqueras, who has announced that there will be a future for the European Parliament elections.
“I can reject the dedevelopment of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish Government represents if I participate as candidates in the European elections,” he said.
Londonderry: the police arrested three men who drove their cars into a house
Police arrested a 33, 34 and a 39-year-old man who drove their cars in Londonderry several times into a house.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent around 19:30.
According to Detective Bob Blemmmings, the gate and the building have been damaged.
You may even have been shot at the car with a hand-held gun at a certain moment.
With Menga's goal, he beat Livingston's Rangers team to 1-0.
With Dolly Menga's first goal, he assured Livingston's victory
Freshly in the first class, Livingston has given the Rangers team a big surprise by bringing Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been working as the coach of the ibrox club since the 18th game.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference, because Gary Holt's team went dead with Hiberniaan's team in second place.
The Gerrards, therefore, continued to remain without a foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish league and will face next Sunday the first-place group of Hearts, for whom eight points are lost.
Before that, however, the Rangers are still waiting for a match on Thursdays against Rapid Wien in the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his division's undefeated series to six wins, which means that Kenny Miller hasn't been taken out with the team last month.
Livingston has missed a number of situations with an inaccurate guest team
Holt's team could've taken the lead well before the only goal in the game, because they had little trouble with their attack games.
Scott Robinson broke through the same opponent's defense, but he pulled the attack, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt turned wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's cross-country ball.
The Hungarian team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure that in fixed gaming situations they could disturb the guests.
The fateful goal was born from a particular situation.
The Rangers had a release, and Livingston found a hole in defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who used this to happen in the middle of the 16th.
At this stage of the game, Rangers was driving in the same ball-breaking, but domestic protection continued to be impenetrable, and Liam Kelly's gate was hardly in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for one situation, when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos's attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was taken by the Rangers' gate, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow has missed a gate from another flight of Livingston.
The cross-directional balls were continuously arriving at the 12th of Livingston, but the guards were removed every time. Two criminals were not received by the attack team: one by Death as a swap player against Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the guarantee.
“Feneal” game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaroni Arena means Alasdair Lamont, a BBC Scotland reporter.
Livingston gave him phenomenal power and he cut off the beans.
Players played excellently, and the expectations have passed since then.
The members and play style of the team have hardly changed since they returned to the lobby, but Holt's efforts deserve a great deal of appreciation, because the coach has been very uplifting the team since his arrival.
Several players have brought in the most excellent form.
Halkett's team commander has made a great deal of protection with excellent organization, and Menga has been a regular fan of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrallt.
The Rangers played without a vision.
As well as they're in charge of Gerrard at times, they've been unable to make that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – otherwise only once they managed to break down domestic protection – so the Rangers had to get together quickly because they slipped back into the middle of the field.
You found a mixed welcome in Köln
It was a pleasant atmosphere and delight that the leaders of Turkey and Germany had a morning meeting on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of his visit to Germany, which was distributed to improve relations between NATO Member States.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
He then traveled to Köln, a newly built ceremony opening a huge mosque.
The city of Köln is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
On security grounds, the police banned the gathering of the 25 000 people before the riot, but several of the President's supporters showed up to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of protestors against Erdo-an, including several Kurds, expressed their rejection of Erdo-an's policy and the decision of the German government to receive the Head of State.
The two opposing protests set a fine example of what some German citizens of Turkish origin celebrate as a hero, while others see the autocrat in it.
Road accident in Deptford: he hit a bicycle car and lost his life
He lost a biker's life when he ran into a car in London.
The carambol took place at the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, Deptford, South East of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the attackers tried to help the bike, but he lost his life on the scene.
The impact occurred only a few months after another bicycle hit-and-run hit-and-run victim on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of the Saturday accident.
According to the London police statement, the police continue to work to establish the identity of the man so that they can notify their relatives.
As a result of the investigation, roadblocks and bus cuts make transport difficult, and the authorities advise that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six prison guards injured during a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a strictly guarded man's prison during the riots that broke out, and the prison director announced.
The riots began at 09:30 a.m. on Sunday morning at Long Lartin penitentiary in the wordstershire, and failed to contain them.
In order to address the situation, the competent authorities have placed a special formation on the scene, which is baptized on the name "Tornado". Eight prisoners are involved in the riots and are confined to a building block.
The members of the special body suffered only minor head injuries, which they managed to provide at the site.
Statement by the speaker of the enforcement organisation: “The specially trained prison team manages the situation in the Long Lartin penitentiary.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and we will transfer those responsible to the police, and they may expect further imprisonment."
In the Long Lartin male penitentiary, more than 500 prisoners are being held, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison director had to be given hospital treatment after one of the prisoners attacked him.
Last October also needed help with a serious riot, in which the prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
The hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the situation in areas affected by drought may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depression, but it is expected that this will be the case for the state at the beginning of next week, when the rest of the hurricane that has crossed Rosa's name is swept through the desert South-West region, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flooding facilities from Western Arizona to the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, as well as the south-east regions of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa is expected to pass through the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected that it will arrive on Monday night and bring great rains.
The Phoenix meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “There have been ten tropical cycles in the form of tropical storms or depression within the 200 miles [200 km] of Phonenix!
The Hurricane Katrina, for example, in 1967, approached its border 40 miles [40 km]."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 50-100 mm of rainfall, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases such as the Arizonan Mogollon Rim area.
In other parts of the south-west desert areas (Medium areas of the Szikós Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) may be counted for 25-50 mm and 100 mm may fall in some places.
Rosa’s rain can bring relief to areas not threatened by lightning waters, as the area is currently affected by severe drought.
Even though floods pose a serious threat, some rainfalls can have a beneficial effect on the south-west landscapes that are struggling with the air.
“The American asymptom services say that more than 40% of Arizona’s area is affected by minimum extreme dryness, which is the second most dangerous category,” says Weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa will be on the coast of Lower California, Mexico for the first time.
It remains hurricane-like, bringing a slice of up to 137 km/h on Sunday morning, moving south to about 600 km from the Mexican Punta Eugene and going approximately 19 km/h north.
The storm meets colder currents in the Pacific and will lose power.
Thus, the coasts of Mexico are expected to be restored as tropical storms in Monday afternoon or evening hours.
In some areas of Mexico, rainfall can be expected, which will significantly increase the chance of flooding.
“The average rainfall can lead to 70 to 150 mm of rain from Alsó-Kalifornia to the north-western part of Sonora, where there may be 250 mm of rain,” says Weather.com.
Rosa is then going through Mexico as a tropical storm, northward, before reaching Arizona's border in early hours on Tuesday mornings, in the form of tropical depression, to sweep through Arizona, for a Tuesday night to the southern areas of Utah.
“The greatest threat caused by Rosa and her remains will be the extraordinary rainfall in Alsó California, North-West Sonora, and the southern desert regions of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Centre.
Drainings are expected to lead to life-threatening lightning waters and carrier flow in desert areas, and in mountain areas, to be kept from earthwrecks.

According to Trump, Kavanaugh had to suffer the Democratic Party's "abuse and anger"
“Aki Kavanaugh votes to judge, voting against the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at the meeting held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during the nomination of Kavanaugh, the Democratic Party had to suffer the “responsibility and anger”.
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday before Congress, where she strongly and passionately denied Christine Blassey Ford's claim that he had committed sexual assault on her as a teenager by decades.
At the hearing, Ford also testifyed and stood by his earlier claims.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw it with their own eyes" that day, Kavanaugh said, “a brilliant and unstinting character”.
“In addition to one of the finest legal professionals in our day, who has an unmacular public service record,” said Dr. Trump, his supporter in Western Virginia.
The president spoke to Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Just five weeks apart from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not going in person, but I'm going, essentially," he said.
- So I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were following the tactics of the "disruption and prevention".
The vote on the first Senate vote on Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, declared a leading Republican consultant to CNN.
Hundreds died in an earthquake in Indonesia, the number of dead ones rising.
A lot of people died, and at least 384 people lost their lives when the huge waves reached the shore. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and a flood on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, declared on Saturday by the local authorities.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival in Palu's town on Friday, when they reached the beach at about six feet (18 feet) at dawn, and they blew up a lot and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The escape price was caused by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When yesterday the refugee warning was voiced, people simply stayed on the beach, they did not escape, so the waves became the victim of the wave,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke of the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency (BNB) at the Jakartai press conference.
“The fountain didn’t just come by itself, ” said Nugroho, “cars, tails, houses, and everything else from the beach,” said Nugroho, “he added that the tsunami was walking 800 km/h along the open sea before reaching the beach.
There were those who climbed up to the top of the trees from the price and fled, said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
In air footage of the disaster published by the Agency, a number of destroyed buildings and shops, several twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a noise surrounding water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further persecutions.
The earthquakes could be detected in a region of about 2.4 million people.
According to the Declaration of the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) the energy was released approximately 200 times more during the earthquake on Friday than in World War II from the nuclear bomb that was dumped in Hirosima.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical features could have strengthened the impact of the escape price.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused was “ significant” and thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, malls and hotels collapsed.
The body of several victims was found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, said, and added that the number of injured persons has so far been 540, and there are 29 more people looking for them.
According to Nugroho's statement, in the coastal region of Palu 300 km (190 km), the number of injured people named Donggala and the damage caused could be even greater as it was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communication is “to be completely paralyzed, to get information from Donggala,” said Nugroho.
“More than 300 000 people live there” stands in the Red Cross Communication, which also announced that the organization’s professionals and volunteers are on their way to the disaster area.
"The situation has already been tragic, but it can be even worse", he added.
On Saturday, the Agency received a number of criticisms about the fact that it did not inform the population of Palu, but according to the management, the waves reached the shore during the alert.
In one of the amateur recordings shared on the social media, a man who tries to warn those who are on the street with desperate cry from the top floor of a building about the coming escape price.
Within a few minutes, there will be a huge waterfall in the coast, with cars and buildings in it.
The Reuters news agency couldn't confirm the credibility of the recording.
The earthquake and the fountain caused a failure to communicate in Palu, making it more difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The military transport of cargo aircraft from Jakarta and from other cities, but according to the authorities, the evacuated population will continue to be highly in need of food and other essential goods.
The city's airport was opened only to facilitate aid work, and is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centres set up on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian fugitive exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to Palu, where employees found shelter under tent poles placed in the office yard, but in their journey they met with terrible signs of destruction, said Doseba.
“ They said that they saw a lot of house in ruins, ” he added.
- It's really bad."
While the aid teams added to preparing disaster response work, some complained that foreign professionals with great experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to the Indonesian regulations, aid, supply of aid and personnel from all overseas countries can only be released into the territory of the country if the location of the accident is declared to be a disaster area at national level.
That didn't happen until then.
“The case will continue to be treated as a country-wide disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, one of the speakers of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
– As the government recognises that it is a disaster at national level, we can allow international aid services, but no notification has been made."
On the second night after Friday's crash and the tsunami, please continue to hope for the missing friends and family members to be among those who are in the dark mood of reporting about natural disasters as well.
On Saturday, rescue work, a boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, the workers managed to free a woman who had been under the ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian National Sniper Team, prepared two contestants for the Asian Games completed at the beginning of the month, which was held this time in Indonesia.
Other disciples outside the missing persons were staying at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“At Veteran, as an umbrella, what happened was a great spiritual burden on me, ” he said.
Gendon recalled that when the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the Cycloth umbrellas, he was desperate to reach those contestants who attended the beach festival for hours at WhatsApp.
But in addition to the messages, instead of two blue peppers, there was only one grey pipe.
“I suppose that means that messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
26 750 dollars were stolen while a bank machine was uploaded on Newport at the Levee mall.
On Friday morning, thieves took $26,750 from a member of the Brink’s staff who just spent an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee mall, standing in the press release of the Newport police station.

Kanye West: Name of the rapper changed to Yé
Kanye West, the rapper's name is from now on, Ye.
The change was announced on Saturday with the following message on Twitter: “The creature previously called Kanye West.”
For some time, the 41-year-old West was called Ye becenamed, and this was the address of the eighth album that appeared in June.
The change of name was announced before Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
In the show, Ariana Grande takes over her role, referring to the "sensitious reasons" she said to the producer of the show.
The new name is not only a shortening of the current artistic name of the rapper – according to previous statements West is of religious importance.
“I know that “Ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “te”, West mentioned earlier when he spoke to Big Boy’s radio broadcaster about his album.
- So I'm you and me, and we're all one.
The Kanye means it's the only one, and it's just Ye, which lives in us, the bad, the confusion, it's all.
Rather, the album reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of those famous rappers who like to change their names first.
Sean Combs, for example, has so far run as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he has announced that from now on, Love and Brother Love prefers names.
West's former co-author, JAY-Z, has also several times different from whether his name needs to be written in the same way, with a tie, or perhaps with a large letter.
The Mexican President agreed not to take the army against civilians
Mr. Andrés Manuel López, Mexican President of Obrador, on the coming 50th anniversary of the colleges in the blood bath, promised that he would never take the force against civilians.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised Tlatelco Square that “although he would not use the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on the square to participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the death of some 300 people when left-hand student movements showed signs of reinforcement in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help Mexican young people – he provides monthly financial support to students and plans to establish additional free state universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organisations.
The US should double the funding framework for MI solutions
As China is becoming increasingly active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for such research, announced Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and user of artificial intelligence solutions, who used Google, Microsoft and Apple earlier.
This is what you said after the United States government reported on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the US does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country's aim is to become the world's number one MI developer by 2030.
“The double cost framework for MI research would be an appropriate start,” said Lee.
By double research aid, there could also be a double chance that the US could take the next big step in the area of artificial intelligence, he said in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Managing Director of the Siovation Ventures Company, one of China's most important MI companies in its Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an MI-system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player, and later as a board member of Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee recognised the results of the technology competitions previously announced by the US Government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when they would organise the next event such as this, because at this time they would be able to explore the new designers.
US researchers often have to work hard to obtain the necessary state support for their research, said Lee.
He added, "It is not China's acidification of scientific leadership, but large companies."
Over the past years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have signed several large university skulls to work in the field of MI.
According to Lee, changes to immigration policy could greatly help the US's efforts in the area of artificial intelligence.
“I think you should automatically get a green card for those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Government Council of China announced its next generation plan for the development of artificial intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China provides similar support to those of academic institutions, as the American National Scientific Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, explained Lee.
This year, the American Ministry of Defence established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre MI, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artistic Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
the NSF currently makes $100 million a year to support MI research.
Meanwhile, the United States of America, which was planning to set up a National Security MI Committee, has not taken any further steps in order to deal with this matter for months.
In Macedonia, there is a referendum on changing the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the country's name "the Republic of Macedonia". This step would bring about a number of decades of disagreement with Greece, which prevented the adoption of an EU and NATO application.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that he is calling for the Greek territory of the same name, and has so far sinned against NATO and EU membership of the country.
In June, the two governments entered into an agreement on the new name of the state, but according to national emotional opponents, they would undermine the ethnic identity of most of the Slavic population of Macedonia by changing their names.
President Ivanov said that he would not take part in the referendum, and as a result of the start-up box campaign, it became doubtful whether the 50% participation rate required for a valid referendum would be exceeded.
The question of voting rights is as follows: ‘Do you support NATO and EU membership of the country and accept the agreement with Greece?’.
Supporters for roll-over, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order to be one of the countries that have risen to Macedonia, as one of the ruins of Yugoslavia, a chance for EU and NATO membership.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it would mean a safer life for all of us", says Olivera Georgijevska (79).
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, it was sufficient for a Member of Parliament to feel obliged to see the result of the vote.
Two-thirds of the name change is needed in Parliament.
According to the State Election Committee, no statement of irregularities was received until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate has reached only 16% up to this point. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (in the end 66% of registered voters).
“I came to vote for my children because we are in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who gave his vote in Skop, capital city.
Zoran Zaev, Macedónia Prime Minister, wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, were put down in addition to the change in their names at the referendum on 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage as well as chairs and tents for the referees before the Parliament building.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but proudly, we want to join with an uplifted head and not through the chat room,” said Kavadarkov.
– We're a poor country, but we didn't lose our dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, then we can turn to China or Russia as part of the European integration process."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, the NATO membership could be accounted for with investments in Macedonia that are highly needed by countries with higher unemployment than 20%.
"I think that the majority will support our case, as more than 80% of the country's population are fundamentally supporting EU and NATO membership", Zaev said.
He added that the vote "yes" means "a guarantee for the future of the country".
According to the results of a survey published by the College of Political Sciences in Macedonia last Monday, 30 to 43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
Based on another survey by Macedón Telma TV, a 57% participation rate is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to go to vote, 70% say he's gonna do yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate should be at least one vote more than 50%.
The incompetence of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western Government, which took power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, gets the full Brighton protection in exchange for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were very careful about the protection of Brighton, so Manchester City won 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero got his 65th shot goal as if it was the easiest thing in the world.
As the first step of the attack, the Argentine warrior received a pass on the middle court, and
With the passage of the three Brighton shields, he got out into the open field.
Then four green fields surrounded Aguero.
A guard was smuggled out, and then he ran down to the 12th of Brighton.
Then he went left to the Sterling that showed up there.
The English warrior has returned the ball to Aguero with force within the sixteenth, who has completed the action on the right hand-hand side of the Brighton netman Mathew Ryan gate.
“Aguero has problems with his feet, ” said the reporters Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City.
– We agreed that you could play 55, up to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, that's when he got the gol."
The initial advantage was obtained by the operation of Sterling for the blues at the British championship.
The goal was born in 29 minutes when
Aguero, staying in the Brightonias, got a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossball on the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane played with the ball for a while before she started the long.
The only way to fight the blues was to stick the ball in the gate before he slipped outside the base line.
The city is next Tuesday, from 12:55 in Rhein-Neckar Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make the Rockies difficult.
Since the Nationals' team missed the opportunity to enter the afterseason, they had no reason to really push for it.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, is looking forward to going on a Sunday course against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play the game. Rockies have a game advantage in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball League.
The Rockies assured themselves at least one comforting place with the victory of the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division address was still waiting for you.
“No matter how we no longer have a chance, we can stand against them by the mood of the audience and the other team in Denver, which is expected to be on the roof as compared to the year before.
Of course I'm in the mood to get in the field like this!"
The Nationals team still has to pick the beginner for Sunday, but the news says that in this situation Scherzer will be the drum.
Scherzer, who took part in a drum training exercise on Thursday, is going to be the 34rd launch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-hand Washington player is 18-7 in the season, 2.53 in the ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 in the game season.
You're campaigning in Trump West Virginia.
The President also referred to the situation of the Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“In November, everything that we have done so far is at stake.
We're only five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the greats, the greats – I don't start in person, but I'm going to start, and that's why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “Everybody can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they are able to use any means to regain power, to see malignancy and malice.
No matter who will be hurt, who will be cut off so that they can have control, they will have power, that is what they want, that is the power and the power, but we will not let ourselves go."
According to the President, the Democrats are putting in place "disruption and obstruction".
"They could have seen all this in the last four days," he said, "to call the Democrats angry and hostile and mean and lying."
According to his name, he mentioned Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Court Committee, in which he expressed the loud protest of the crowd.
“Do you remember what you answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – all this very bad body language, it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party will no longer support diversity.
It's not tolerating people who are free to say what they think.
I wasn't surprised at all when Momentum's activists decided on my censorship in my own party.
After all, I am only the last one in the long line of the Labour Party Members who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have said what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment for the unbridled opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which, ironically, are the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
At the invitation of the working party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, it was said that they wanted a “sufficient and productive meeting. ”
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today, however, the sound has changed, and the promise of a policy that is “advanced, more polite” has been forgotten if it has ever come true at all.
It is more and more noticeable that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and I thought that my colleagues with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, and recently they were looking forward to turning their back on my individual opinion, and I would take up a position that I would otherwise never agree with, whether it be about national security matters or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, regardless of what I've said, they're starting to stop on social media, they're following my shift, they're critical of the policy that's going to go to the middle, and they're telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, since the comments I have received are usually limited to politics.
I admire the pros and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to act as sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of our day's policy is that attacks of this level have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the need for the Labour Party to support its culture of tolerance.
The reality is, however, that we have abandoned diversity and, with all the "unsecure" initiatives and any amendment to electoral rules, the circle of parties has become narrower.
Over the past few years, many have advised me not to be so literal, and then “all will be fine.”
But that's not why I've gone to politics.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student, because I was upset that the Thatcher government has neglected schools so much that our classroom was almost destroyed and then fought for a better close view in the interests of the most deprived local councillor and government minister.
I never hid my political views under the belt, and I did nothing different during the last election.
It was quite clear to everyone in Nottingham East which political positions I represent and which topics I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to spend so much time and energy on questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that it will not prevent me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of everyone.
Mr Chris Leslie, Representative of Nottingham East
Ayr–Melrose 38-17: Ayr goes to the top undefeated
Two late attempts have been somewhat modified at the same end, but there is no doubt that Ayr's earned victory at the most attractive game of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the head of the table, the only one of the ten teams is unbeatable.
Thanks to their unparalleled protection and forced use of the situation, they won, so that the Hungarians and Coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a great challenge during our previous games, but we are still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, Melrose's player, said: “We need to know that Ayr has made much better use of his situations than we do.”
With Grant Anderson's 14th-minute experiment, from which he made Frazier Climo, Ayr took advantage. Thanks to the yellow card from Captain Rory Hughes, loaned to Warriors, the Melrose could've gone off, but Jason Baggot didn't have a point.
Climo was a criminal insinuating the defense of Ayr, half-time and then a one-person experiment, so the first half-time ended with 17-5 results for Ayr.
Melrose began the second half strongly, selling Baggót's attempt at Patrick Anderson, reducing the disadvantage of the team to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, as Ruarith Knott suffered severe injury and had to be removed from the track and Ayr increased its advantage by trying Stafford McDowall, whose beancies were managed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, got a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment from breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to catch up again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for installing Climo without a ball, MacPherson introduced a touch down from the crime line behind the Ayr assault team.
Climo sold what was repeated almost immediately after the reboot when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's high kicks and sent Gregor Henry an informant to try his fifth home.
Still Game’s main character has started a new career in the catering industry
It seems that one of Still Game's stars, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry: it turns out that a restaurant was taken to the head of the company director.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvist plays in the popular show of the BBC, written together and formed with his old co-man, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth season would be the end of the line, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from the “drinking catering industry” of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a coast is hoping that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the maritime command with sailboats in La Paz.
In the middle of the oceans, the flags of the ocean lie.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon announce the following motto: “We are ready for the sea.
We have a duty to get it back."
The memories of the lost shore in Bolivia, which are still alive in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, and the desire to breathe the waves of the Pacific, are still alive.
These hopes may have been the most powerful for many decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the final judgment of the International Court of Justice of October to close five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the ball that floods people with the spirit of belonging and peace in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A lot of Bolivian follow-up to the decision of the International Court of Justice, hopes that the Hague Court will stand next to Bolivia, and it will be mandatory for Chile to sit on a trial table after decades of rapsodical attitude to obtain its independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, indigenous President of Bolivia, who is facing a conflicting fight for the re-election of next year, can lose a lot with Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would not change much if it were good for Bolivia.
The United Nations body, which is established in the Netherlands, has no right to judge areas in Chile, and has made it possible for it to have no impact on the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was born only six months after the closing speeches indicates that the case was “not complicated, ” said Mr Zárate, an expert on international law in Chile.
In addition, for the last four years, she didn't help Bolivia's case, but she even took it back.
"The current Bolivian Government has addressed the maritime exit issue," Zárat stated.
– Because of Morales' hostile rhetoric, the rest of the Chileans' goodwill has gone away."
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at a point, but it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not delegated each other ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, disagrees with the finding that court rulings would have been unusually rapid.
Monday, Bolivia is “an exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and a chance to“ both come out well from closing a 139 years conflict,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would have used the marine debate to challenge political advantages.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific, ” she added.
– The judgment gives us the opportunity to see it's time to get over the past."
North Korea: no nuclear decommissioning until they can trust America
According to Ri Jongho's North Korean Secretary of State, his country won't be the first to land nuclear weapons if they can't trust him in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made to the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore Summit.
The comment was made when it seemed that Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, was able to resume the failed nuclear talks over three months after the summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jingongun.
According to Ri, “I desire” to believe that the U.S. blockage of continuous sanctions and war in Korea will ever be enough to force North Korea on its knees.
Washington tries to accept a statement if Phenjan doesn't take significant steps towards decomposition.
Both Kim Jingongun and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is a wide range of skepticism that is driven by Phenjan's commitment to the removal of the arsenal, which is likely to be the only key in the country's safety.
Pompeo's planning a visit to phenyan next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The fashion shows in Paris show show show show show show show shows the great heads up that will soon show up in top-class shops.
If you want to expand your hat collection or want to completely cover the day, you don't have to look anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgears as part of their Spring/Spanish collection in 2019, which was welcomed by the stylish audience of the Paris Fashion Week.
They did not call them practical hats giving rise to sensations on Instagram during the summer, and they also set attention to their works of art as well as fashion designers.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an oversized beige hat, which was decorated with a pen-like, wide carima and almost completely swallowed the head of the models.
Among the other oversized accessories were the Greek dills, a magical base, and even an anarchist, which were not really designed to keep the man’s head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with the choice of bizarre masks, even at the same time as Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were sewn together, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Culture.
One of these looked like a dive mask, filled with pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melted ice cream.
If you get these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
The style analysis suggests that large hats may already be on their way to upper class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path “La Bomba” that we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The culture mark behind the few practical hats of social media shows a new piece on the way out: a seam beach pot that is almost as large as the bath bed that holds it.
The dark orange rafi bag, decorated by rafis, has a white leather grip on top of it – one of the outstanding pieces of the Spring/Laviera collection in Jacquemus 2019 was the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of stars, said to FEMAIL: “I expect the huge hats and beaches to appear next summer in the upper category clothing store. The designer has produced an elemental effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential for world citizens
This situation has not changed until 2018, in view of the new rising survey results, which is only further enhanced by individual and group successes achieved in sports, arts, music and other Community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 students have studied in such institutions as The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and are seeking to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen career and their position as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where it is possible to design and introduce customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a language that you understand, it gets to your head.
But if you speak his tongue, it gets to the heart."
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and confidence with those from other countries.
The results from this year's exam show that students from independent schools across countries have achieved the best results from foreign languages.
68% of all students studying foreign language achieved higher A (excess of 85%).
Based on the data collected from SCIS 74 school, 72 percent of the students received a higher degree in Mandarin, while 72, 69, and 63 percent of the French students reached Grade A.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages as essential knowledge, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages, such as selected objects, have become as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both independent and other schools.
The 2014 study of the United Kingdom's Committee on Employment and Training revealed that 17% of employers find it difficult to upload empty positions due to a lack of language recognition.
Also, knowledge of language becomes more and more necessary to enable young people to enter a successful career.
Because of growing knowledge of foreign languages at work, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Independently of what kind of career one chooses when he has learned a foreign language, he provides long - term knowledge from which he has a clear advantage.
A direct ability to communicate with other nationalities provides automatic competitive advantages to those who speak more languages.
According to YourGov's survey, in which 4000 adults were asked in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were not well aware of any foreign language in order to speak to others, and France was the only language that more than 10% (15%) of respondents spoke.
That is why it is important that we still focus on teaching children the language.
Talks in several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children to seek important work as an adult with a better chance.
In Scotland, every school will deal with other languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarins or Japanese, which are expected to be of paramount importance to the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the area of interest of the child, you will be able to learn more optional languages at independent schools, and you will be trainees who are experts in your area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they will need to succeed, with whatever the future needs.
It is not difficult to see that languages are still vital for the future of a country in the current global business environment, and that education must reflect this.
In fact, the knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools offer young people in Scotland choice, diversity and quality education.
Il faut bien le faire – that's how it should be.
John Edward, President of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron in San Diego shows up at Lakers on Sunday
They don't have to wait long for fans who seem to be sitting around to see LeBron James first step on track in Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play the Sunday opening for Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're gonna spend on the field is still a question.
“More than one and less than 48, ” wrote Walton on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said that James would probably only play for a limited time.
After a couple of days of training, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-table foreplay.
“ At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the lobby to be ready, ” he replied.
Trump Western Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of the five scheduled events of Trump's next week, including those who support him, Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that Trump has been postponed to fill the vacant position of the Supreme Court, he is trying to gather supporters for the forthcoming semi-term elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes are running in November.
When will Trump start tonight's Western Virginia event, and where can you follow it online?
The speech of Trump Wheeling (Nyugat-Virginia) starts at 7 a.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can also be followed online through YouTube's live broadcast.
Trump is likely to affect this weekly hearing of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which has proved particularly tense in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmatory vote has been suspended for up to one week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary aim of the sudden increasing events is to help the Republicans' situation before the elections in November.
According to Trump's campaign advisor, the five events next week are “for the activation of voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” says Reuters.
“To be able to know the direction of Congress in his hand, the political plan is so critical that the President visits as many states as possible. We look forward to a frequent campaign period for Reuters,” he reported to a campaign speaker who asked to shut down his name.
The event scheduled for Wheelingi Wesbanco Arena today “It can bring supporters from the countries of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and even into the announcements of the pittsburg media,” says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month for Trump to visit West Virginia, the state where more than 40 percent won in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who's not in a favourable position.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey to have the president personally intervened to be more involved in surveys,” said Simon Haeder, Politologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The American team has full shoulders before Sunday individuals to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts to play four games on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup needed a great deal.
The luck and moment-to-be shirt is a quite air-conditioned sports concept, yet all players believe in it, mainly in races like Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had a six-point lead, and they had only four advantages, so we can say that we have the ball right now,” said Jordan Spieth, as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, four points still lead Europe and twelve more can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells, feel that they've finally got a little back and can get encouragement from more than anything, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they both got three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start of the hole to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
The shouts of great victory were getting louder and louder, as they went ahead with the circle, with a critical twist and a balance in the fourth game, so that he and Thomas were in double disadvantage after two.
The decision-making twist of the game resulted in a cry of joy like the 15th hole, a kind that can make the viewer believe that the American team is not yet lost.
“You just have to dig deep in yourself and take care of your own game,” said Spieth.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes in your chance to leave a trail.
In the last two days only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple in Ryder Cup, could score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange but loving couple brought four out of four, and it seems they can't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't perform above the bar on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning at the last nine stages of the morning.
Thanks to the dynamics of this series and between them and their larymously supporting audience, they became the poison by Sunday, and nobody is expected better to ensure Europe's victory with the sun's rest on the Le Golf National track than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best one at a time would be a win in different holes.
However, it would be too early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio García, the hero of the morning four when Alex Noren played together.
Once with one and twice two punches over the par, the first nine holes in Spain and Sweden pushed them into a wave valley from which they had no chance to climb.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball games and the four-games are very fun looking close thanks to the interaction of the couple. You can watch who gives you the advice you don't give, and how you can change the strategy in a glance.
Europe has been better played as a team so far, and it has a major advantage for the last day, but this four section has shown that the American team has the Kurassi needed to fight, despite the fact that many people have been missing them, especially from the American side.
Europe's 10-6 final day of Ryder Cup
Europe can start its last day with a good advantage, after the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday have been closed against the United States with 10-6 results.
The two of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the bow, making two victorys against the sick Tiger Woods, bringing the difference to four points in the Le Golf National field.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who tries to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the series against the constantly wrong American team in the morning's four-ball match.
America showed greater resistance over the fours, bringing two games, but they couldn't absorb the difference in this way.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from 12 individual games Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points in a series, while she and Molinari, who are only mentioned as "Molliwood" after the end of a sensational weekend, the second pair of Ryder Cup history, which won four points at four opening blocks.
After they beat the Woods-Patrick Reed pair in the four-ball game, they won the two of the Unmoved Woods and the American Newcomer, Bryson Dechambeau, with their great team play.
Woods, who, in two games, dragged himself on Saturdays, sometimes gave him a taste for his talent, but he lost 19 out of 29 games with four ball players and four, seven of them in a string.
Justin Rose, who rested during the four-balls in the morning, returned to Henrik stenson, and in the fours, two-two-ones, a party was defeated by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third positions of the world ranking.
Europe, however, did not manage everything on this pleasant, windy day, from Paris to the south-west.
The three-time title defender Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it.
A painless 2&1 victory was won against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter pair in the four-balls, and they returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 ratios after losing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, only twice a team managed to come back from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although Furyk's title protection team is a tie enough to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of being only the second best, a Sunday counter-resurrection seems rather unreal.
"There is no way North Korea would be able to land unilaterally if it did not trust its negotiating partner
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that maintaining sanctions would only increase the lack of confidence in the United States and there was no way that the country would hand over its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea “made significant and ambitious steps” over the last year, for example, shut down nuclear and missile experiments, closed the site of nuclear experiments, and promised not to expand its nuclear arsenal and its scope of application.
“ Unfortunately, however, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” he said.
– Without trust in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and under such circumstances we are not allowed to be brought down on one side and first."
Although Ri once again expressed North Korea's disappointment that Washington resists the idea of a "special" nuclear decommissioning, which, in a scenario, would receive North Korea rewards for the steps that have been taken, its statement seemed significant, as it did not explicitly reject unilateral nuclear decommissioning, as Phenjan had done so far.
Ri referred to a joint declaration made by Kim Dzongun and Donald Trump at the first summit ever before between a powerful American president and North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June, and during which Kim promised to work on the "nuclear decommission of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's integrity.
North Korea is trying to make an official point by the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but according to the United States, Phenjan has to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington wouldn't allow us to have strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear decommissioning and increase the pressure on us to force his will, and also protest against it, so that the war can be declared closed,” Ri said.
– The idea that we can be forced into our knees by sanctions is the desire of those who do not know us.
The problem is that non-communicated sanctions only increase our suspicion."
Ri did not mention that it was planned to be a second summit between Kim and Trump, but the President of the United States has spoken separately in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Rather, the minister pointed out that three meetings were held between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Dzsein for the last five months and added: “If the country concerned by nuclear decommissioning was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear decommission of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a path.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the North American continent's target was inevitable with North Korean missiles after Trump, the evil president, Kimet called it "a rocket man" who is on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with complete destruction last year, damaged Kim with praise that she had the courage to take steps towards devastation, but she also noted that there are still many work left and sanctions remain until North Korea implements nuclear decommissioning.
Wednesday Trump said that no time limit was imposed, that is, “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have been taken so far.
On the other hand, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said in the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be observed in a way that will not result in actual, final, proven nuclear decommissioning.”
The Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to reduce the financing of Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Rí at the UN General Assembly's break, and then he said he was going back to Phenjan next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip hasn't been very good.
After he left Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea subsequently accused him of bringing up with "gesterical claims" hours later.
In the framework of this month's meeting with Mun, North Korea promised to land a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States took "the right steps".
According to Mun, the "emergency steps" mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump got into Singapore or those that could lead to normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are instructed to take sufficient rest
A new subject at Harvard University this year was the students who had been looking for more sleep, also fighting the culture of the whole nightly learning that was heated by caffeine, which was becoming more and more so in the form of a macho.
Academia concluded that students from the world's first university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, according to which Professor Charles Czeisler designed the first training in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College, and is trained as a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of the course to give a presentation on the impact of sleeping withdrawal on learning earlier.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked me, ‘Why do I only now face this as a senior?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which was surprising," said Telegraph.
During the first course launched this year, students will be informed about the fundamental impact of the appropriate sleep habits on their study and sports performance, not only their overall positive impact.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and director of the Health Service of the University, the university decided to launch the course because during the week, students were found to be extremely unsatisfied.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
For example, one shows a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, gym shoes and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light by how sports performance is affected by unsatisfying and why bedtime routines are important.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep withdrawal increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present an interactive icon map of the university's territory so that the participants can reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that we will not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to such knowledge – as you have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which it is expected to learn performance for one night continues to flourish, said, adding that modern technology and the constantly increasing pressure on students lead to increasing problems of sleeplessness.
A sufficient and high quality sleep is the “secure weapon” of students to protect against stress, fatigue and anxiety, even obesity, as sleep retention forces them into a hungry way and causes continued hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler in the design of the course, a 19-year-old student in California who studied chemistry and biophysics, and last year he first admitted one of the professor's courses in Harvard.
He said that the people there heard him open his eyes and encouraged him to build a university-level training armpit.
He hopes that the next step will be for postgraduate students to participate in a similar training program before they can be placed in the competition sector.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a warning for bedtime, wake up, and experience the harmful effects of electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily reduce their daily rhythm and make it difficult for them to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and gets the goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb drove Steven Gerrard's slipped team into a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibroxians tried to win their first alien victory after the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gerrard's second defeat from Gary Holt's team's 18 games as a manager left eight points from the first seat of the Ladbrokes Premiership (Scot Championship) and Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before the half-time, and the non-motivated team of Rangers didn't even get close to the equation.
While the Rangers slipped to the sixth place, Livingston was stuck on the third floor, leaving Hibernian alone because of the difference in the goal.
In addition, Rangers may face further difficulties following medical care due to the loss of Calum Spence's head, probably due to a drop from the visitor's view.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that got into the semifinal of the Betfred Cup with the blowout of Ayr.
Holt got into the same race with 11 people who took a point from Hearts last week, and would have been happy to watch his team strangled up his opponent's game where he was able to do it.
Although the Rangers were driving in the ball-bending, Livingston took more than he could get.
They could've been on the move in the first two minutes when Scott Pittman was first shot at Allan McGregor's gate, but the middle court couldn't sell the ziccet.
Keaghan Jacobs landed at Craig Halkett's team captain, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, found only the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved to be punished at the fifteenth minute when he confronted Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson had been able to deal with Colombian complaints.
The Rangers only had two first half-time shots, but the former ibroxi Gater, Liam Kelly, barely caused problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's attempt came against the game in the 34th minute, no one can deny that they earned the chance, just for their hard work.
The Rangers again missed a ziccier that was forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball in to Scott Robinson, who did well to find Menga for the easy ending.
Gerrard decided in the break, he switched Couliball to Ryan Kent, and it almost immediately explained his influence on the game when the extreme Morelost moved, but Kelly blocking the impressive form in time.
Livingston continued to play the right game that he was able to play, and Lithgow and Halkett were swept up the long balls.
Holt's team could have had a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor was good at holding the net and hitting Jacobs' position before Lithgow was hung by a nail.
As the Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton tried to fight another eleven when he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson wasn't able to convince him.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter
One detail of our "vasday breakfast" almanach: September 30, 1882, just 136 years ago... the day when the later physicsist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a invention that could have been born as a tool known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been one of the basic science tools since then, and thanks to the 1950 strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogerst and Dale Evans, the film "Bells of Coronado" has become part of the popular culture:
Man: “What is this miracle?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. Radioactive minerals such as uranium can be sought with it.
If you put this headphone on, you can hear the voices of the atoms released for the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Just listen to me, he's kind of squeezing.
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 only a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, he continues to live in the invention of a person who wears his wife.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” the abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy the abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that immune cells should be obtained from the patient and then changed in a laboratory.
So they can "see" the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers that re-inject treated immune cells into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells has given her the opportunity to say goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of an immune cell extraction from the patient; it is modified in the laboratory to “take” the protein HER2, which is often accompanied by various types of cancer; then the cells are transplanted.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results allow us to conclude that there is a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 “encouraging the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on highlighting immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has already been successful in treating one of the types of leukaemia.
Kanye West SNL, who wore a MAGA cap, was promoted to a bullying tiger in support of Trump.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was exposed to the Saturday Night Live studio after an inconsistency, in which he praised President Donald Trump of the United States, and then announced that he would apply for President's post in 2020.
After she presented her third song that night, Ghost Town, in her signed hat Make America Great Again, she began to speak against the Democrats and again stressed Trump's support.
“ often when I speak to someone who is white, he asks: “How can you like Trump because he’s racist?”
If you were interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL programme was opened by Matt Damon with a parade in which Brett Kavanaugh, a Hollywood star, has been working in front of the Senate Justice Committee on sexual harassment charges against Christine Blassey Ford.
Although he wasn't on board, the video of West was uploaded by Chris Rock's humorist to social media sites.
Well, it's not clear if Rock wanted to drive us out of West with the charge.
West was even complaining to the audience that they were running behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They scared me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out in that hat.”
You scared me!
And they said that I was in the sunken place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a place out of sight? I accept my Superman cape, because that means they can’t tell me what to do.
Try to love me."
His manifestations were accompanied by at least twice by a smoker from the audience and apparently by SNL actors, according to one of the witnesses to Variety, they were embarrassed: “The whole studio was silent.
Westet Ariana Grande was invited to the last moment his former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before he died.
West also asked questions when he presented his song I Love it dressed as Perrier.
West is the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who provided support in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: the United Nations, HOW TO DO IT.”
Karen Hunter, host of a chat show, said that West was simply “managed, and that was great”.
“But I decided not to reward someone (with his music or the purchase of fashion articles or the support of his “art”), who I believe is possessing and spreading ideologicals that harm the community I belong to.
He's free.
But we did," he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he is “the being known earlier as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and that's what we know as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His friend Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion, and, of course, his late legend Prince also changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist they once knew as Prince.
They're charging the Belgian restaurant delay with a humane attempt.
A 45-year-old man is accused of a murder attempt after a man at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the case happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant has to stand before the City Court of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutions are being reviewed by the D.A.
Kit Harington, star of the Battle of Thrones finds excessive masculine harm.
Kit Harington is most known as the Battle of Thrones as Jon Snow, and in HBO’s violent fantasy series, he often has swords himself too.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke against the stereotype macular heroes, highlighting that, in view of such heroes, little boys often feel that hard action is required to fight out respect.
Kit said in his statement to The Sunday Times Culture that he said "something went wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of the harmful effects of excessive masculineism during the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married his 31-year-old serial colleague, Rose Leslie, told me that she thought it was very important to remedy the problem.
“To me, this case is very deeply touched — how has manhood been distorted?” the actor asked.
– What did we teach men when they were kids about the problem we are facing?"
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of a distorted image of manhood, as the shows often include very masculine characters.
He added: “What is it that is born with us, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and TV say to young boys that make them feel like men can only be like that?
I think this is one big question of our age – and how we can change it.
Because it clearly appears that something is wrong with young men."
Who said in the interview that after the summer season of the series, there will be no mention of the Thronok Harca events or events, because “it is clear of the battlefields and horses”.
From November, he will play a major role in the reprocessing of his film Kit Sam Shepard True West, a producer and his slave brother.
The actor told me that the best thing he's ever received from the Thrones is his wife, Rose, who he's known when he's making the show.
“I met my wife at the shooting, so I owe my future family and my life before me to the show,” said Kit.
Rose Ygritte, who was in love with Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Prize-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: In China, the number of new patients increased by 14%
China reported an increase of 14% in the country of HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that this means more than 820 000 people involved.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by around 40 000.
Compared to the past, a change in the number of newly infected people is a sexual approach to the disease.
The disease has spread rapidly before in some parts of China with the transfer of infected blood.
However, health officials at a conference held in Yunna province said that the number of such cases has been nearly zero since then.
Nevertheless, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
The transmission of HIV by sexual means is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong since then.
According to estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men end up marrying women due to the conservative trend in the country.
In many cases, the disease spreads due to inadequate sexual control.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of a problem response programme.
Maxine Waters denies that one of his crews has leaked Republican Senators' data and condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracies".
On Saturday, American representative Maxine Waters rejected the allegations that one member of his staff had published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Senators' Wikipedia website.
According to the Democratic Representative of Los Angeles, the claims in question were distributed by "right-right" experts and websites.
"The truth, the lie and even more low lies" – Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information provided was reported to contain the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The information was made available on Thursday on the Internet. It is unknown, but it is sure that they were released from the Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that the IP address identified as the source is connected to Waters' office, and that data is also reported on one of the members of Waters' staff, says The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lies – Waters continued.
– My staff has no responsibility for leaking information. However, the right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security was injured as a result of the accusations of fraud and liars.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying."
Waters' statements were quickly quoted on the Internet, including the critics Ari Fleischer, former Press Secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial, ” wrote Fleischer.
– On this basis, it appears that Waters does not have the blood temperature required for his representative’s office.
If someone is suspected of something that he didn't do, he can't react angryly.
You can't be rude.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm."
Waters' reaction to apparently Judge Kavanaugh's democratic criticism was likened to him, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for members of Waters during the mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it is true, then it’s serious” he wrote in his message.
Waters wrote in its communication that his office informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities of false charges.
“We will ensure that the person of the perpetrators is informed,” continued Waters, and that they are legally responsible for all acts that endanger or harm any member of the staff.”
Johnny English beat again, or Rowan Atkinson's smuggler spy game
Today, we are looking for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there can be no exception to this category of activities playing/parodia under Johnny English, whose first part, Johnny English in 2003, the second part, Johnny English, was refilled in 2011.
Will the British nation become the new export product of sarcastic, self-depositable satiries in which we live on our own obvious parading?
It is certain that the garbage has a rigid, rubber-shaped, incompetent Johnny English has had sufficient mutations for a new return – it is also clear from its name that this comedy has been created to make the crowds of people looking at the movies of non-English mother tongue.
Johnny English, of course, is a smuggled secret agent who thinks he's a winner with a bizarre attitude, so he reminds me of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who has contributed to the performance of the main titled Firesakers at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-lost Barclaycard TV commercial, and he left a mess everywhere.
There's a few good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and then knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's Komicical wife is well applied in the film, but the humor of the film isn't really working, and it's not even superfluous, because today, the French people with the sound of the word "heavy", such as James Bond movies or Mission Impossible series, are also a bold touch to the tool of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and to me, Johnny English-flavored, left-handed adventures do not achieve the level of thought and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Great Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercrimeist broke into the super secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the greatest horror of agent Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, had just received such a small role in the film.
This may be the last angle in the coffin of the self-distributed and distributed Prime Minister, whose political popularity is in ruins: Emma Thompson practically shapes Theresa May and brings everything out of the character that is otherwise poorly written.
The intelligence advisors tell him that since all the active agents have been found, he has to set up a restless agent for work.
This restless agent, of course, is Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher since his retreat at a preschool school, but who teaches children to spy on the subject, of course, here are funny scenes, while he describes the foundations of spying as English-like "Rocksuli".
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where you will meet again at the emergency briefing with a former weapons carrier of much suffering, Bough, who is now acting by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married to a captain of a submarine since then, who always gets his mouth shut – the Captain is formed by Vicki Pepperdine, who called for a much better role than that.
So his Majesty’s two-sided “Batman and Robin" partner will again take action and face up to Ophelia Bulletova, a woman of the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a true destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is becoming increasingly involved with the charismatic IT billionaire, who claims to be able to solve Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy forms it.
English and Bough will start their clown mission: they will set fire to the waiter in a fancy French restaurant, and then, in the middle of an amazing turn, they will smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury, and English will actually free the hell when you try to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR-head.
These stations need to get to the end, but we've managed to make any fun and turnouts, perhaps too much of a child's film.
The end result is pretty mediocre.
As for the other Johnny English films, I have the question: can't the British film group finally give Rowan Atkinson a talent worthy role?
The British Labour Party refuses to introduce four-day working hours while paying the British for a five-day job
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical draft, introducing a four-day working week, all of which would make workers work for five days' wages.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the revolution of artificial intelligence (MI) by providing extra days for workers as a result of increased income.
According to the draft, the workers would get three-day weekends while taking me home as much as they've ever been.
According to the resources, the idea would be appropriate for the party's economic programme, which aims to open the balance sheet language on the side of the workers in the country.
The four-day working week will also be supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, which would allow workers to benefit from the changing economy.
One of the leading officials of the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “The policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to the next, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party's programme that would open the balance sheet language to the workers in the economy, it also fits into the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The working party would not be the first to support such an idea, and the Green Party has already been campaigned at the elections in 2017 with the four-day working week promise.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The speaker of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the question is not even on the agenda.”
Mr McDonnell, Minister of Shadow Finance, presented his vision of the Socialist Revolution on the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "unscrupulous directors" and "sounders" of the regime.
If the plans of the shadow money minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water companies would not recover the full profits they receive, since a Labour Government would use “reductions” as a penalty for the alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he plans to make workers a member of the board and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would group 10% of the private sector’s shares to workers who would thus be able to receive 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy betrayed on the "60 Minutes" program whether the FBI investigation involving Kavanaugh could change their opinion
As a result of the FBI investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, at least one week later than the original date, the final vote on the election of Kavanaugh's Supreme Judge will be held.
In his interview on Sunday “60 Minutes”, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his colleague in South Carolina.
“ I understand, of course, ” said Kennedy.
That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were released, and I asked him, “You did it?”
His answer was firm and clear."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be safe.
“I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and there would be extremely serious accusations to change my mind,” Graham said.
– Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied the claims – he added Graham to Christine Blasey Ford.
- And no one named Dr. Ford has ever justified the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new would ever come out."
What is a global citizen festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the annual music event, held in New York, is a festival of global citizens. World stars are taking place at the festival to stand for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will now be held on a week’s schedule, expected to spend tens of thousands of years on Central Park’s Great Press, where participants will not only enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but will also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the eradication of the deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is operated by an international interest group aimed at eradicating poverty by bringing more and more people into an active fight against poverty.
A free ticket for the concert can be obtained (unless they are willing to pay for VIP ticket) who undertake to perform certain tasks or “changes”, such as taking up voluntary work, sending e-mails to a leading politician, a telephone call or any other relevant activity to draw attention to the purpose of the project: eradicating poverty.
But how successful has it really been for the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with a concert to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of "cliktivism", when people feel that they have contributed to a cause by signing or writing an online petition?
Since 2011, more than 19 million “creatives” have been carried out by project supporters who have served a number of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to the decoupling of 37 billion dollars by world leaders of policies and commitments against poverty, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and a declaration that they were from their actions, 10 billion of which were already paid or collected in fundraising.
The group estimates that the money collected has been directly affected by nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and contractors based in the United Kingdom, which aims to "help children achieve their potential". The organization promised 35 million dollars to help Rwanda eliminate hunger after having received more than 47,000 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
“With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can call social injustice and malnutrition into the footnotes of history books,” said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also claims that after more than 5,000 actions requested the United Kingdom to improve the food supply of mothers and children, the government allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food supply of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently published questions on the Internet of Global Citizens is: “Why do you think deep poverty can be eliminated?”.
According to the answer of a global citizen, “There will be a long and difficult journey that sometimes leads to a break and sometimes fail.
But like previous civil and anti-regulating movements, we also achieve our goal because we are stronger together."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Moonae will be present at this year's New York event, and the programme shows will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of the Interior: United States of America's Navy "block" would apply to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary", Washington, as well as the Navy, would fight against the market entry of Russian energy carriers, such as the Middle East, would not be able to reach the Russian energy," said Ryan Zinke, US Minister for Interior, Washington Examner.
Zinke claims that Russia's active presence in Syria, particularly as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is just one reason for Russia's acquisition of new energy markets.
“I think they are only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” said Zinke in a statement.
And according to the Home Secretary, there are methods to prevent Russians.
“The United States of America is able to ensure that maritime routes are open and can bring them under a block if necessary. It can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” said Zinke.
Zinke has his words to the participants of the non-profit event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group, by the way, defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared his action against Russia and Iran, and noted that it was practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in the same way: using existing energy carriers and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, “as he called Russia a “one-dimensional economy”, pointing to the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.
Statements coincide with the plan of the Trump government to export LNG to Europe, thereby reducing Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump government, including the president themselves, are trying to convince Germany to back off the ‘unfair’ project called Northern Áramlat 2, which, if implemented, will make Moscow a ‘ hostage’.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity is a double-up project, which will increase to 110 billion cubic metres, with 11 billion dollars in Northern Áram 2 lines only of economic nature.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is opposed to such economic considerations, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
“I suppose we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure exercise, and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers,” said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy, after a meeting with the US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow, September.
The American attempt to convince went backwards, since Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industrial Association (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy, as is the case with bilateral contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
“I regard it as a problem when a third state intervenes in our energy matters,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after the last meeting of Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren is ‘sufficiently considering’ to run for the presidency in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, on Saturday, said that after the mid-term elections, "he will consider a lot" to go for the presidency
Warren Massachusetts, at a town meeting in Holyoke, confirmed that he was considering his departure.
“It is time for women to enter Washington and restore the badly functioning government, and it is also time for a woman to be president,” Warren said The Hill.
– After 6 November, I seriously consider going for the Presidency."
At the town meeting with Warren's criticism, Donald Trump, and he said that he said that he would "run the country in a bad direction".
“I am paying attention to the serious concern Donald Trump does with our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren literally criticised Trump and Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate.
In a Friday's Twitter message Warren wrote, "Oh, of course, there's a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, based on a survey published on Thursday , the majority of Warren's massachusettsi voters do not think Warren should start for the Presidency in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Presidency Centre and the Boston Globe survey, 58% of the massachusetts who voted for Warren’s “good chance” say that the Senator shouldn’t start for the presidency while
32% support Warren's presidency.
According to the survey, the majority of the previous governors of Deval Patrick would be supported by 38% and 48% would be opposed.
In the context of the 2020 presidential election, there has been, among other things, the name of high-ranking democratic politicians such as former Vice-President Joe Biden, or Senator Bernie Sanders Vermont.
According to the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to leave until January.
Sarah Palin Track Palin at Donald Trump's PTSD meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after she applied in September
On Monday night, he was arrested for rape inside the family.
“As my son goes through, which he's gone through since he got home, I understand the rest of the families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are returning home,” said Sarah Palin to the audience at a meeting in Donald Trump Oklahoma, Tulsa.
The arrest of Palin's son was called “the elephant in the room,” and he said that his son, like the other war veterans, “realed, he came back hard, and he kept thinking whether he had due respect for the ministry of his fellow soldiers, pilots and all other military members for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in charge of domestic violence against a woman.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of the new American asylum policy, whereby those who are fleeing violence by gangs or in families cannot receive asylum.
Representatives from 18 different Member States and from Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is in court attacking policy, says NBC News.
In August, the full name of the applicant in the case of Grace v Sessions, initiated by the Union of American Civil Liberties, has not been published.
According to the applicant woman, she was assaulted by her partner and “sons of this violent gang, ” but American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's being held in custody in Texas.
Public prosecutors El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have been described as places where many asylum requests to the United States come from, because in these countries violence committed by criminals and within the family is a constant problem.
The new American asylum policy has withdrawn a decision taken by the Committee on Immigration, Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) in 2014, under which immigrants without documents could submit asylum applications in response to domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General stated in a Friday's communication that the new policy "is missing decades of state, federal and international law."
‘In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed in accordance with the facts and circumstances in which they exist, and such an obstacle violates this principle’, reads the expert letter.
In addition, the prosecutors explained in the letter that policy against immigration would harm the American economy, since immigrants would be more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest-level jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed the asylum courts not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and of crime.
“The right of asylum is for those who leave their country because of racial, religious, national origin, debt to a specific social group or a well-founded fear of persecution,” said Sessions at the time of the announcement of policy on 11 June.
The right to asylum has not been found to solve all day and day problems of people around the world – they are all of a serious nature.
A desperate rescue in Palu, the number of the dead doubled, the rescue scenes are racing with time.
The situation of survivors is becoming more and more unforeseeable.
“Every one is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while he calms down a feverous little boy in the center of an evacuation in Palu, a disaster.
- The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have drinking water."
Some of the residents returned to their homes to save from some of the frozen things that could still be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, which have also been damaged by an earthquake of 7.5, are not able to treat people.
Some of the injured, including the broken-backed and shouldered Dwi Harist, were transported to the Palui Military Hospital. The patients were seen outside the hospital because of the large-scale after-resurrections.
The man’s eyes were easy when he remembered, as the fifth floor hotel room with his wife and daughter was hit by a devastating crash.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was trapped in the fallen walls – Haris said to the Associated Press, and then added that his family came to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry out for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of placing propaganda advertising on the ground
The Chinese Ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the American press. This happened a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that emphasized the mutual benefits of American-China trade relations.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to his publication in China's Daily Des Moines Register, the largest copy of Iowa, while he accused China of trying to intervene in the US Congress elections of November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections, according to some U.S. officials who announce to Reuters that it is a new phase against Washington China, an increasingly powerful act aimed at putting China under pressure.
Although it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, the increasingly intensive trade war between Beijing and Washington is going to end up with new and new customs duties on each other's imported products.
According to experts from the United States and China, at the beginning of the trade war, Chinese customs duties were intended to target exporters from the countries where Trump and the Republican Party were popular, for example in Iowa.
Terry Branstad, former ambassador of the United States of America and former governors of Iowa for several cycles, declared that Beijing was harming US workers, farmers and businesses, since the State of Iowa exported a significant quantity of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China is still nervous about our country by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government takes advantage of the American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid advertising in Des Moines Register,” said Branstad.
However, if we go to a Beijing newspaper store, we can hardly find articles with critical voice. The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect the different views of Chinese people on the ever-greater growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad added that “one of China’s most famous newspapers refused to publish” his article, but he did not mention the newspaper.
It's said that the Republicans can get women's voters in the middle term before the elections with the Kavanaugh division.
It is noted that many high-ranking Republican politicians are going to defend Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate in cross-border protection of sexual harassment charges, in particular, that women's voters may lose their support before mid-term elections.
The case caused intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be taken back – says Grant Reeher, politologist at the University of Syria’s Maxwell School, in one of the Saturdays article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the FBI investigation proposed by the Republican Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona at the last minute will be sufficient to reassure the angry voters.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor in November,” said a newspaper from Washington, D.C., who lives in Washington, Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Adviser of the Progressive Group MoveOn, and national spokesperson on Friday.
According to Mickey's report, on Friday morning, a few protestors on the Senate corridor reported that "It's November", because despite Dr. Christine Blakey Ford's testimony, Kavanaugh, who is under Republican control, decided not to withdraw his nomination.
“It is going to jump enormously into democratic enthusiasm and motivation” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst on the news page.
“Many people say that it has been already very high, and that is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the insecure female voters and young people (18-29 years old), who, although not enthusiastic for the president, often do not go to vote."
Analysts have already assumed before Ford's public confession that he could return to the Republicans if they continue to stand by the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford has described in detail why he is accused of sexual harassment by the supreme court candidate.
“The Republican Party has been wrong on the ground,” said NBC News at the beginning of last week, former president of the Republican National Commission, Michael Steele.
“This is not only about the vote by the Commission and the final vote, but also about the way the Republicans handled the matter, and as they did with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, US Director of Priority to help the election of the Democrats.
It seems, however, that the Americans have quite shared whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true, that Kavanaugh has little faith than Ford.
According to yourGov's new survey, 41% of respondents have fully or more believed that Ford's testimony, while 35% of the respondents have answered Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents say that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying in his testimony, while 30% of Ford thought that.
According to Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations of authenticity, as did another accused of Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez's claims, states the Guardian.
Ford swore an oath a week ago before the Senate Justice Committee that at 17 years old, Kavanaugh was drunk on him.
Ramirez claims that the supreme court candidate showed him his sex organ at a party in the 1980s when they both studied in Yale.
The explorer of the world network would launch a new internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, starts a startup with the aim of picking up the competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solidra.
The users with Solid can choose where to store their data and who can access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that the intention behind Inrupt was “the acquisition of the world’s empire. ”
“We must do this now,” he said.
- It's a historic moment."
The application allows people to create their own "personal online database" with Solid technology, also known as POD.
This may include lists, lists of tasks, calendars, musical libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify from the same browser at the same time.
In the personal online repository, it is unique that the user can decide entirely who can access his data.
This is what the company calls "equipment of the right of self-regulation of persons over personal data".
According to John Bruce, CEO Inrupt, the company is responsible for providing resources, processes and adequate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contractual developers working in the project, or a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week forward, world technology developers will be able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask "Facebook and Google whether to run the technology that brings total change from one day to the next, which would put the business models of companies on top of their heads."
"We don't ask permission from them."
In his release on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is “to send commercial energy and to provide an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network of Solidra.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Konzorcium at the University of Massachusetts.
Berners-Lee has taken part in discussions about the neutrality of the Internet as an important opinion in recent months.
Despite the launch of the Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Konzorcium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am definitely optimistic about the next era of the world net,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann was celebrated at World War I in the Czech Republic
The only Viktória cross he received is the English priest's hometown 100 years after he performed his hero in World War I.
Bernard Vann was awarded honorable and alezredes during the attack in Bellenglis and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he could never know that he deserved the highest honor of the British armed forces.
Two grandkids of his reverence were found at the Saturday ceremony in Northamptonshire County in Rushden.
One grandson, Michael Vann, said he was “symbolik” that the messenger was given just 100 years after his grandfather’s work worthy of honor.
According to London Gazette, Bernard Vann was transferred to the Channel de Saint-Quentin channel on September 29, 1918 by “the middle of a dense fog and a sharp gun and machine gun fire”.
Later, he hurried into the faceline, and “with exclusive heroism” stood on the head of the flag, and then a camp cannon special was attacked only by three of its members.
Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, only a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never get to what my grandfather did, and this taught me humility,” said Michael Vann, 72 years old.
After the march led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have multiplied the memorial mark.
Michael Vann said it was an honor to have played a role in the celebration, and then added: “The appeal of a true hero is demonstrated by how many will be expressed toward their later honor.”
The MMA raiders have flown all night to watch Bellator 206 broadcast instead of Peppa's pig.
Imagine you've been hanging all night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, and this broadcast's gone.
There were 13 encounters on the San José show, six of which were broadcast live in the United Kingdom as part of the main event on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, England's viewers were not a little surprise for the game instead of a Peppa pig.
This was difficult for many who remained up until dawn because of the crash.
Instead of MMA games, a child cartoon was placed on Twitter by one of the fans of "some sick joke".
“In the morning of 6 a.m., according to the State Regulation, this content cannot be transmitted by the channel, so they had to change to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Communication and Marketing Department of Bellator.
- Yeah, it's Peppa, time for the pig."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator's company promised that in the future, the schedule of the show would be revised so that the United Kingdom viewers would be taken into account.
“I think we can solve this by repeating it, ” Coker said.
– However, since it's six o'clock on Sunday morning, until our Sunday, which is Monday, we can't take care of the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show was turned on, there were a lot of messages, and the majority were not very friendly.
First we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to correct the mistake.
But that's not what we're talking about, it's a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of six, there will be only five matches in the program – we would very much like to do it for the viewers, but we counted ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sexual orientation with a minority complex
Tom Daley's art jumper said that at a young age, he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but that made him feel motivated to succeed.
According to a 24-year-old athlete, until high school, he didn't realize "not everyone" like him.
At Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told the director that he would stand up for gay rights to give others “a chance. ”
He added that since he became a parent, he's much less interested in the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, left out for several months because of the disease.
In Laverne’s first show, Daley invited me to “shipbreaker” said that as a young man, he felt “less than anyone else, ” because“ he was socially unacceptable if he loved boys and girls. ”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and strangers is what I hold firm and strong in order to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth something so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when he found out about his sexual orientation.
The double Olympic Bronzérmény has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community, and, using its role in this year's national community games in Australia, has asked the world's governments to decriminalise homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said that he spoke about the matter because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others “a chance. ”
The three-time world champion said that “the situation was totally surprising,” when he fell in love with another man, the head of the state of Dustin Lance Black, who met him first in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter got married last year, and he said that age difference never meant a problem.
“If you go through so many things when you were young, ” said 14 years old, “and your father died three years later in cancer, ” you will find someone in his own age class who had similar extreme experiences.
In June, the couple adopted a little boy whose name was Robert Ray Black-Daley.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing is to win gold coin, ” she said.
There are more important things than my Olympic gold medal.
"My Olympic gold medal, Robbie."
The child's name was Robert after Daley's father, who died at 40 years of age in 2011 after he was diagnosed with brain tumors.
According to Daley's statement, his father did not want to accept that he would die, and one of the last questions was whether they had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London because he wanted to sit there in the first row.
“ I was powerless to answer that, ” he quoted, “Dad, you will no longer be there in the first row. ”
“I put his hand on him when he stopped breathing, but until the moment I could not accept that my father was not vulnerable,” he said.
The following year Daley attended the 2012 Olympics and got my bronchial.
“I was convinced that this is what I dreamed of all my life — to jump in front of a home audience on the Olympic Games,” he said.
The number Heather Small Proud (Hyske) helped her in the preparation of the Olympics, and until today she will be a werewolf if she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts at 11:15 on the BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson record can be set by attending the 47th cup of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but you have to win its form back if you don't want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience.
Mickelson plays a record on 12th time at the biennial event, because of his performance on Saturday's four-ball and four-games, but Jim Furyk's team captain sent him to the bench.
Instead of having five winning players at the big races at the heart of events, as often as they had to fight for the victory of the United States, it now cheers up in one half of the day, spends the other half of the exercise on the track and tries to correct the weakening mistakes of the game.
Karierje was never one of the most accurate hits, so 48-year-old players are not really located in Le Golf National's narrow track, where high grass costs a very high price for mistakes.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will be facing the English champion Francesco Molinari, who won all the four games this week in the team with Tommy Fleetwood, which is the starter.
If the Americans with a four-point disadvantage start strongly before the 12 individual matches, Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk claims to trust the player, but what else could he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in today’s development. He beat my back, scratched me, and promised he would be ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
- You're extremely confident.
She's one of the biggest ones, and she's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
I mean, basically, I didn't want two games for him.
I've planned more, but in the situation, we've decided that this is the best solution.
He wants to be in the field, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson's Sunday role, Nick Faldo's record will be defeated, no one's ever played more games on the Ryder Cup.
This allows you to close a series on the Ryder Cup, which is far from the player's individual performance.
Mickelson 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven decisives, however, Furyk pointed out that the presence of the veteran player has tangible advantages for the team.
“ He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with the others, he’s a great teammate, ” he explained.
– I think younger players also enjoyed the games they played against him, and it's good to see that.
"His presence goes beyond playing in a strict sense."
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their advantage
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup holding individual games, they can easily turn their back on him.
The Danish player first appeared in a 1997 Valderrama match where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and then just to the end they managed to retain a hairy advantage for the 141⁄2-131/2 victory.
“We must remind ourselves that, in vain, we have made a great advantage in Valderrama, but we have only won with one hair, and we have had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bjørn, after his victory in class 5-3 and yesterday, which leads to 10-6 on Le Golf National.
– We've been thinking about competitions in the past years, and everyone's already seeing that the game is not over.
You're gonna have to play full-time tomorrow.
So come on, and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the points get on the board.
We have a goal that is no different than to win this trophy, and that's all we need to focus on right now.
As I said before, I mainly deal with 12 players from our team, but we also have to pay attention to the other side, who happen to be among the largest players in the world."
Bjørn, proud of the team’s performance on the hard track, added: “I would never be able to predict in such a situation.
It's a whole different pasta tomorrow.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different from team play.
It's a great feeling playing in a couple when things go well, but when you stand up individually, in all respects you'll find out what a golfer really is.
That's what you need to understand with the players that tomorrow they're bringing out the best in the field.
They must break away from their partner, who will also have to take the best form."
Unlike Bjørnnel, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team specifically trusts that his players perform better individually than in pairs, except for the double of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three of the four points.
According to Furyk, both sides of the last-day resurrections have already been seen: in Brookline he was a team of winners, and then the losing side was after the daring performance of the European team as a "medinah miracle".
“I remember every damn word, ” he replied when he asked him, “because before the last day, the players were encouraged by team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
- We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we've got a quick start, as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams gets into it, it puts the opponent's players under huge pressure during the middle games.
We set the order accordingly and prepared our players so that they could perform a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas received the task of facing the efforts to reverse the position and playing against Rory McIlroy at the first match, and then in line with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the first half of the European team.
“I have also decided on the order, because I believe that this is the way the picture will come together from the beginning to the end,” added Bjørn to the individual attitude.
Once again, the transfer of Germany’s latest warship has been postponed
The latest fregat of the German Navy should have been placed in service in 2014 to replace the warships of cold war, but because of the various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, it was waiting for you for at least next year.
The flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg fregattok, the “Rheinland-Pfalz” was postponed to the first half of 2019, wrote Die Zeit a weekly, quoted as one of the military spokespersons.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the continuing delays have made the fate of the major project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg class ships to replace the Bréma class-class chronograph fregats.
We understand that there will be a high-fired cannon and that it will be equipped with various aircraft and craft missiles and cloaking technology, including a sign-up device to reduce the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it is often needed for maintenance, which in practice means that these latest fregats can be placed in service for up to two years away from the mother’s keys.
However, because of the continuous slip of the project, these high-tech warships, which Germany could feel beyond the sea, may be obsolete when finally assigned to service, have noted Die Zeit.
Last year, F125 ferrets were posted when the German Navy officially rejected the vehicle and sent it back to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship delivered back to the manufacturer.
There is little information on the causes of the return, however, the German media has several critical “soft and hardware mistakes” that make the warship unusable in a combat operation.
Software deficiencies are a major problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the Baden-Württemberg class ships, which only half of the crew of the old Bréma class.
It has also been shown that the ship is extremely overweight, which undermines its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to later make further changes.
The 7000 tonnes ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ are reported to be twice as heavy as German ships of similar class to those set up in World War II.
Apart from defective components, the increase in the total cost of the project, including crew training, is an increasing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial draft was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the new fregats are of particular importance in the light of warnings that Germany's presence in the sea is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's National Defence Committee, has recently acknowledged that the Navy is “starting out of the vessels of a state of takeability”.
According to the civil servant, the problem has become a self-sufficient process in the meantime, as old ships have to be installed, but there are no more ships that could be replaced.
He expressed concern about the fact that even one of the Baden-Württemberg class ferrets could not join the Navy bonds.
National Trust is searching for the secret lives of bats
New research is being carried out on a Scottish-outland estate aimed at finding out how bats use their landscape features while hunting.
Researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which may also benefit future species conservation initiatives.
National Trust for Scotland scientists will examine the behaviour of common and soprano midwives and brown long-fleeves and water bats in the Inverewe Garden, in Wester Ross.
In the relevant points of the area, special means of receiving are placed in order to record the activities of bats during the season.
And NHS staff and volunteers will use manual detectors to collect mobile data.
A detailed analysis of the sound content of the recordings can determine the frequency of bat sounds and the species which they are doing.
Researchers are also preparing a habitat map and report, which can help to determine in detail how animals are being behaved depending on their landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS conservation consultant, is hoping that the results will reveal which are the most important habitats for the bats, and which species uses them.
This information will help determine the beneficial effects of housing work, such as the construction of layers, and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other relevant species.
The size of bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the past century.
Buildings and spatial development work interfere with the sleep places of the animals and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are a risk factor for them, as well as the attacks of domestic cats, as are certain chemical procedures used for applied flame paper, construction materials.
The bats are not really blind.
However, because of their nighttime predator, they rely more on their hearing when they are hunting for a preacher than on their sight.
They can determine the exact position of insects and road objects by using their sophisticated techniques to reverse the ultrasound.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 acres of land, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleeper studies and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organization has created its first and only dedicated bats on the Thrave bridges in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of the ten bats of Scotland.
According to David Thompson's owner, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here, in Three, they have a great place for bats, ” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is necessary for a good living space.
But we don't know much much about bats yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great about."
He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that bats live there before the renovation of buildings, as the destruction of a single establishment could result in the destruction of 400 female and young individuals, which could lead to the death of the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals, their destruction, their harassment, and their habitat is banned by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for the help of the population.
He said: “We still have many things we don’t know about bats, and we don’t have nearly any information about the situation of the population of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies sexual assault charges, lawyers sue against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of sexual violence against him, and he thought that others wanted to use his name to "get into public consciousness".
Focist lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly card, Der Spiegel, in charge.
A member of the Portuguese framework and the Juventus battlefield were accused of rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375 000 to listen to the case, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo reported in a Instagram Live video with a 142 million fan camp that the news was "a lie".
"No, no, no, no, and no.
The things they put together today are all lies," told the camera the five-time gold ball player.
"They want to use my name to get into public consciousness.
It happens.
They want to become famous by my name. It's the life of publicists.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine with my life," added the player to a smile.
Because of the claims that were called “an unacceptable suspicion of privacy”, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will submit a claim for damages “to the extent of the serious nature of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights committed in recent years.”
The case was allegedly held in June 2009 in a suite of Hotel Palms and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man was sexually raped, stands in the documents submitted to the District Attorney's Office of the county of Clark in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo was on his knees after the incident and told him that he was “99 percent a good boy,” except for “one percent”.
On the basis of the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that he had sexual relations with the woman, but he believes that all this had been done with the consent of the woman.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police station, and that she had a vision of her injuries in a hospital, but later she entered into an agreement outside the court because she was afraid of being attacked and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman would now like to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to make her life worse.
Ronaldo was just in front of a confirmation at the time of the alleged attack (from Real Madrid to Manchester United), and this summer, the giant in Italy and Juve bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will “for ever” loss of car factories
The United Kingdom will “forever” if you lose your world leader’s position after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Enterprise.
He added: "responsive" the statement given to the BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, then the car factory will be forced to temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"There is a need for an agreement," said Clark.
According to the Japanese automotive company, jobs may be lost due to cross-border delays in a non-negotiated Brexit.
Over the last year, the burnaston factory unit that produced the Tokyo Auris and Avensis models produced 150,000 cars, which accounted for 90% of the total exports to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I see that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, there will be production shutdowns at the factory", said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concerns about the possibility that the country will leave the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
The BMW, for example, declared that after Brexit, it would close its production plant in Oxford for a month.
Car manufacturers are mostly concerned that risks arise in the case of Brex without an agreement in relation to the supply chain.
Toyota production line works on the basis of "in good time", parts come from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, cross-border disturbances may lead to delays in production and a lack of parts.
Toyota stated that it would be impossible to store enough parts for more than one day at the plant in Derbyshire, and that production should therefore be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, "is carefully compiled so as to avoid late controls at the border."
“We need an agreement. We want an agreement under the best possible conditions, with which we can not only enjoy the fruit of our current success but also offer new opportunities – said the BBC Radio 4 Today.
– It is not only Mr Toby, but other producers who can confirm that we need, in any case, an outstandingly successful supply chain."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would stand, but he warned that the combined costs could in the long term damage the competitiveness of the factory, which could ultimately lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is currently active in the representation of the Unite trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs will never be recovered at this time.”
One government speaker said: "We have developed a sound and feasible plan for future EU relations."
You can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, announced the White House
“A new week may be postponed” is the big-time meeting between Deputy General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump, as the debate about the supreme court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues to continue and published on Sunday in the White House.
Mr Rosenstein will oversee the work of a special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who will examine the Russian influence on the elections, the possible relations between Trump's advisors and the Russian government, and the possible obstacle to the justice system by Trump.
In Washington, they've been thinking for months that Trump will end up running the deputy Attorney General, putting Mueller's independence in danger.
According to this month's report from the New York Times, Rosenstein considered whether he would arrive at the meeting to record his conversation with the president and whether Trump could be replaced on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the speakers.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and the rumor was to submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, whose presence was then before the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "not be willing" to go to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he wouldn't run into hearing the Senate Committee on Justice, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected he was sexually guilty, Dr. Christine Blassey Ford, too.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which has been postponed by the final Senate vote.
Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, made a visit to Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein Summit, the following answer was: “We do not have a designated date yet, or we can go on this week, but in the light of the cases at the highest court, I see some new opportunities for one week’s silence.
Soon we'll find out, and as always, I'll notify the press."
Some journalists, however, expressed doubt about this statement: Sanders did not hold a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace also asked about this.
Sanders replied that the rareity of press conferences was the cause of the anti-abuse of television reporters, but added: “I do not dispute the fact that they are really sensationalists.”
He then pointed out that direct meetings between representatives of the Trump and the press would take place more often.
“The President has asked me to ask you more questions than any previous president,” he said. He added, even without supporting the claim, “We looked at the numbers.”
Press releases will continue, said Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, the light years are better than talking to me.
We are often trying to do this, and many of these events have taken place in the past few weeks, so they can speak to the President of the United States in person instead of the White House press conferences."
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in public events, or in press conferences, with visiting dignity.
However, the press conferences alone are very rare.
Why, it may be concluded that this week, when President New York was producing an unruly and bizarre role in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the health wallet sent a letter to the workers of the NHS Scotland EU due to concerns about Brexit
The head of the health wallet expressed the country's gratitude for the workers from the countries of Scotland NHS from the European Union and stressed that he hoped they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the expected exit of the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of settled claims for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter Freeman wrote: “The negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued during the summer, as a result of which a decision is expected to be taken in autumn.
The UK Government also contributed to the preparation of a scenario without agreement.
I am aware of the worrying period for you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of which country they come from.

Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebackerén, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury on Saturday, with a defeat of 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported Mike Organ Tennessee.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told the journalists that the damage occurred shortly before the half-time.
“He walked out to the coastline and just fell,” said Reed.
The team and the members of the healthcare staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen along the track and then put it on the barrel and took it for further investigations.
One of Tennessee State's competent authorities in Nashville Tennessee told Chris Harris, the WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond the surgery that was carried out at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “he doesn’t know more details about the type and extent of the injury,” while Tennessee State is working on finding out exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student who rests for a year, spends the first season on Tennessee State's team, where she has been certified from Illinois.
On Saturday, he introduced five successful installations before he left the track, so he's 18 in the season.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes on properties purchased in the United Kingdom
On the basis of the new Toryk plan, foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes on properties purchased in the United Kingdom and would support homeless people with additional revenues.
With this step, I would like to neutralise the success of the young voters in Corbyn.
Raising taxes is aimed at those who do not tax in the United Kingdom
According to the Treasury's calculations, this would mean an annual sum of GBP 120 million, which would be used to support homeless people
Foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes on properties purchased in the United Kingdom, and the resulting surplus income will be used to support homeless people, and will be announced at a press conference today.
The aim of this step is probably to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn in young voters, which he has made with the promise of more affordable housing and measures aimed at high incomes.
The increase in the tax will affect individuals and companies who do not tax in the United Kingdom and will use their surplus revenue to combat homeless people.
The additional charge added to the current levy, which can be calculated two years ago in excess of the higher rate of property purchased for the second apartment or for the purpose of publishing, up to three per cent.
The State Treasury accounts for an annual revenue of GBP 120 million.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by citizens outside the United Kingdom, causing a significant price increase which makes the situation of the first housing sellers increasingly difficult.
Many of the land’s rich districts became a spirit city, especially in the capital, as many foreign customers spend much of their time outside the country.
The new bill came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in fees to help young people prepare to wait for their first home.
He personally considers the construction companies responsible for maintaining high house prices, which have become a custom to buy and leave the property on a parlaga. May asked to delete the quotas for affordable houses and to start something with the "occupied situation" in the country.
Mr Corbyn presented remarkable proposals for housing reforms, including wage control and the elimination of unjustified removals.
It would also provide more authority and opportunity for councils to build new houses.
May stated: “Tavaly said that my Prime Minister wanted to devote my English dream to restoring it, and that life should be better for each generation.
To this end, the real estate situation needs to be resolved.
Britain continues, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family.
However, it is wrong for individuals outside the country and companies with foreign interests to be able to buy property as easily as hard-working British citizens.
Dreams from their own homes became almost unreachable for too many, and the unfair state of homelessness became too available."
Jack Ross: “I most wanted to be the manager of the Scottish team”
According to Jack Ross, Sunderland's coach, "the greatest desire" is to be the manager of the Scottish national team once.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to meet the challenges posed by the North-East Club, which are currently in the third place of the first-class league, with only three points behind the first position.
He then transferred his seat to the stadium of Light after the last season the team of St. Mirren successfully returned to the first-class Scottish football tournament.
“I wanted to play for my country as a representative.
Unfortunately, however, I was only able to get into the sparers – Ross said at the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
– When I was a child, I watched a lot of Scottish team games with my father in Hampden, and something always got back to them.
Now, however, I only have a chance to succeed as a club manager."
Among Ross's predecessors are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not concerned that he has to step up to such great names, and he has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
"At the moment of success, I will assess whether I can get the team back to first class.
If we take the club's structure and facilities, it will undoubtedly be in the first-class league," he said.
– It won't be easy to get back, but more than likely, I'll only be able to view my activity here as a success if I succeed in getting the club back."
Ross's career only started three years ago after he was a deputy coach at the Dumbarton team and spent 15 months at Hearts' gym.
After that, Aolla helped him get back on his feet after the team fell into the third class, and with St. Mirren on the edge of the fall in the next season, he got the title of the champion.
Ross claims that he's feeling much more confident now than he's ever played in his career, like Clyde, Hartlepool, Fallkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic team.
“It was a critical moment – he mentioned the period as Alloa’s coach.
– Clearly, I thought management was for me rather than for me to be a player.
That sounds weird, because I did it well, and I had a very good life of it, and I had some truly memorable moments.
However, the lives of the players are sometimes very hard.
There's a lot to go through every single week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the work has meant stress and pressure, but the management tasks are up to me.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, I feel like I'm the best in my skin right now."
The full interview will be broadcasted on the Radio Scotland channel on Sunday 30 September, at local time from 12:00 to 13:00.
A study says Saturday afternoon at 5:30, beer is best
In the summer heat wave, there has been a significant increase in the traffic of the hard-to-be pubs in England, but there is still a great pressure on the food chains.
According to the data collected, the income of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who compiled statistics, said: “The trend of the previous month in July, thanks to a longer world championship than we expected between the sun and England, when pubs experienced an increase of 2.8%, is the difference that we could see even greater decline than restaurants.
The decrease in the income of the restaurants in June was further worsening in July.
In particular, alcohol pubs and bars did the best to produce more growth than the loss of restaurants.
The pubs offering more food were also affected by the lasting sun, although not nearly as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people prefer drinking at this time.
The income of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the income from food fell by 3%."
According to a RSM analysis by Paul Newman, a leisure and catering industry: “These results follow the trend since the end of April.
Weather and major social and sports events are still a key source of revenue for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the food chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual revenue loss of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressure.
It could not have been worse for long, hot summers for operators, and it would only take time to find out if the lower weather in August will bring about a relief in this area."
The total revenue increase in pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, including newly opened places, which reflects the slowing pace of the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors and analyses sales in the UK catering sector (for pubs, bars and restaurants), is a widely accepted industrial focus, collecting and analysing performance data from a group of operators of over 9 billion important total sales of 47 members.
A child has five children with social media sons who are kept from their parents
A survey shows that five children (only 11 years of age) have social media sons who are kept secret from their parents and teachers
According to a survey of 20 000 secondary schools asking, the number of Insta sites is increasing
As a result of the news, fear of sharing sexual content is increased.
20% of students responded that they had a "head" account that their parents could see.
A child from five creates a social media account (alway he's 11 years old) that he's been keeping from adults.
According to a survey of 20 000 high school students, the number of Insta files is growing rapidly, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing page.
As a result of the news, fear of sharing sexual content is increasing.
20% of the students responded to the fact that they have an unmacular “head” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found herself on the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found her a teenage profile, where she stood to “rap you up."
According to research conducted by the Directors and Directors of Digital Academy UK and independent schools, 40 % of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% recognise that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said the head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of “sporters” in the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the Management Board.
The most effective attitude of Doyle Scotland, and according to the panel president, Ian Beattie, will be an inestimable help for sports decision makers from the wide international experience of his existence over the past decade.
“Eilith is a great honour in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international athletan community, and its presence will help the development of Scotland’s athetics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am delighted to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really help the work of the Scottish sports leaders.”
Two of the four Olympic gold coins of the American athlete regularly reporting at the BBC acquired at the Atlantic Olympics in 1996 at 200 metres and 400 metres, but were forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on his Twitter: “A month ago, I received a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that over time, I'd be able to make things right.
With a man trying job, but I've managed to fully recover, I can walk again, I'm going to agitating training!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
The breast cancer that resembles mothers cows shares the online community
An online debate was created by an advertising of breast-feeding companies, which compared breast-feeding mothers to the main stench.
Elvie claimed that he developed “the world’s first silent, portable breast cleaner,” and that the appearance of his product was advertised in ironic advertising, which presented the freedom the device gives to mothers who are cutting down their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's room full of straw, while in the background the song text which draws up the following lines can be heard: "Yes, I have a head, I have no tail," and "if I hadn't noticed, they're not my breasts, they're my breasts."
And the rephrene says: “I am pumping, that the child eats big ones, pumping, pumping, heading the girls.”
The publication published on Facebook site of the company was quickly cross-checked with online disputes.
The video has reached 77,000 views and has received hundreds of comments showing mixed acceptances. Many people believe that advertising has been made out of the horrors of the dairy industry.
‘A great deal of tasteless cows promote the product.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give birth to life, but their calves are taken away from them in days," recalls one of the commentants.
Elvie breast-feeding can be found in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother and the calf.
But why don't we use them to sell breasts to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added: "A totally insensitive advertisement."
Others came to protect the advertising, a woman admitted that the video was “really funny.”
"I think it's brilliant.
I would have taken it straight if I were breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not trying to see it.
The product is brilliant" – written.
Another comment says: “This is a funny ad for mothers who are “teaching” their milk at work or in a toilet.
It does not glorify or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they had their discreet breasts on their bra while dancing.
The campaign builds on the feeling that women who use the breast-feeding sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, however, does not use wires and tubes, can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra, so women can move freely, hold their children in hand, or even move out while breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner of Mother and its communication director, says: “ Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
We wanted to draw attention to the challenges of breast-feeding and to the funny way in which our breast-smoker provides sense of freedom in comparison with this."
Elvie's chest was not the first time on the news.
On the London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother entered Marta Jakubowski’s clothing while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of child-age migrants in custody reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that the harsh rhetoric of Trump administration and its measures have made it more difficult for them to find more accessible homes.
Integrators are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and fear that they would ruin their chances of staying in the country if they applied for their children.
This threat increased further in June when it was announced that the host parents and adults living with them in a household should be given fingerprints and that these data are shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Head of Immigration and Customs Environment (Vematic and Customs) recognised in his statement last week of Congress that dozens of people were arrested to receive minors who came without escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of the arrests were impunity.
“80% of people applying to and living in a household are illegally staying in the country and a significant proportion of them are convicted of criminals.
Therefore, we continue to look for such individuals", said Albence.
In order to speed up the child proceedings, new rules have been introduced, according to which a part of them must appear before the court within one month of being held, instead of 60 days before the court, the social workers are appointed.
A lot of people log in at the court for a videoconference call instead of a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge doesn't grant legal protection, the immigrant will be pushed out quickly.
Over the past few months, social workers and those working in the system have reported that the longer they continue to arrest, the more nervous and depressed children will be, and the potential for violent outbreaks or escape attempts will increase.
According to lawyers, these risks are only being increased by a larger facility similar to those of his gymnastics, where the number of children makes it more difficult to filter those who need psychological care.
They added that if they do not provide enough time for children to prepare or to say good-bye to friends before moving them to an installation like this, they are even more traumatized.
Syria called for American, French and Turkish “emergence forces” to leave immediately.
Despite the civil war in the country that has been starting eight years ago, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
Moualem, a Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign troops entered the Syrian territory illegally, referring to the fight against terrorism, and will “be treated with them.”
"They must withdraw, and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem proved that “war against terrorism is about to end quickly” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He stated that Damascus “continues its holy struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “the illegal foreign presence.”
The 2000 U.S. soldiers stay in Syria, the majority of them help the Arab militias fighting Kurd forces and Bassar el-Aszad as a training and advisor.
France has sent over 1,000 soldiers into the country of war.
Regarding refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were appropriate for their return and that only the “one Western countries” were driven by the “irrural fears” of the refugees from returning home.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the population return, ” he said.
– Politicians made a purely humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Aszad and its opposition to the war is concluded.
According to UN diplomats, an agreement has recently been reached between Russia and Turkey, which will create a collision with the last great surprise of those who will rise around Idlib, could contribute to further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the Russians from attacking a wide range of Syrian government forces against the three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed the fact that the agreement set out "clear deadlines" and indicated his hope that military action would be directed against only jihadists, including An-Nustra Front, linked to Al-Kaida, which should be "researched."
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that it will soon be possible to bring together a committee of delegates from the government and opposition to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare elections.
Among the conditions of Moualem, the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, for example, only 'reviewing certain articles of the present constitution', is acceptable and protects all external actors from intervention.
That's why they're going to re-select Trump
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020 unless the hopes of a number of liberal viewers become real, and a responsibility procedure or a scandal will not end its Presidency before time.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential son of all time.”
But for now, viewers are enjoying the show.
Since 2014, the CNN’s main programme-time view has increased to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has almost tripled its view to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the main programme period instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC is the most viewed cable show with its 3.5 million audience, which is reached during the evenings of the most significant news days.

"Why", he asked Scovell.
“For he made me laugh,” answered the driver.
This is the entertainment power of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade-precedens, whether they can reunite with immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
There's only one very narrow layer that can make sure you don't care about these facts.
However, it is no longer a responsible part of information when we are staring at a discussion show for the authenticity of the anonymous background talks used in Bob Woodward's book on "Wild", or about Paul Manafort's $15,000 strucbő's jacket ("the body filled with arrogance" as defined by The Washington Post), or about the consequences of Stormy Daniels Trump, um, his description of anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, from now on, that's what I think about Super Marion.
“It’s a little like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, author of “Zalogstargs”. The players are constantly changing their show and daily coming to the new rounds (the N.F.L. starts to praise Kim Jingongun).

Both parties spend money on half-time Congress's biggest competitions
No one was surprised that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, both parties spent unpredictably spending money after the re-cast of the Congress districts, two active representatives struggle for the same chair.
Competitors for the newly re-designed city district in Pittsburgh are the Democratic Conor Lamb, who gained a mandate last spring in an interim election.
On behalf of Lamb, the Republican Keith Rothfus is currently a representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which shows a significant overlap with the 17th district today.
The map had to be revised after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, in January, established that the former district borders were manipulated to the benefit of the Republicans.
In the battle for the 17th district, the funding bodies of the two parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRC) almost slipped each other during the campaign.
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after winning in close competition the March interim election in the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, the representative seat was the Republicans, Donald Trump won the district with a precise advantage.
According to political experts, the Democrats have some better chances of winning.
United States of America, El Salvador, considering sanctions to support China, then resigned from the plan
According to the diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on Beijing's side, which Washington barely responded to.
Donald Trump was in a good mood with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017, and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out his team as leader of the Trump Organisation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called back the members of the U.S. headquarters from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of their decision to “do not support Taiwan”, previously announced Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about 140 million US dollars of aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have painfully affected the Central American country, where the unemployment and murder rate would also be extremely high.
As the close-up meetings continued, the North and Central American competent authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been to continue a similar meeting last year and the primary aim was to reduce migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that I wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence also spoke at the mid-October conference, which, according to diplomats, is a clear indication of the importance of administration.
The three American delegates returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue criminal statements and no criminal sanctions.
John Bolton's White House spokesperson did not wish to comment on the details of the debate, which three American officials, including two diplomats, have anonymously reported.
They were also supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next blow could be a report by a special prosecutor named Robert Mueller, who's looking into whether Trump has prevented justice in some way... and a number of facts that have been published suggestive of this.
Mueller's investigation is alleged to cover whether Trump's team has cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are involved in a majority of Congress, they will certainly try to take Trump, who, after the voters, may have to face the judgment of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and the fall of Trump is far from inevitable... as it is for European friends.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic, depending on how far the fight will go.
In 1938, several German officers were ready to blow Hitler, only expected the West to join Czechoslovakia in Munich.
The aid has not been granted so that it has not been possible to prevent the bloodshed of the following years.
At a similar historical turning point, the inevitable development of democracy is slowing down or slowing down.
In today's America, we can identify a number of such turning points.
What are we gonna do if Trump turns down Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, investigating Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been fluctuating since last year when, as our newspaper reported on it, he suggested, they would record talks with the president and call on Trump to carry out his unqualified office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is terminated or incomplete, and despite a charge of sexual harassment that is considered credible, is a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is that we are voting for a Congress that is willing to take Trump to blame?
If we fail on these trials, democracy is facing a long winter.
I trust it won't happen, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once existed in my home ambassadory building.
My mother survived the holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she asked me to light candles on a table bearing the sign of the Svastika.
How can I be a pessimist in our future with such cultural heritage?"

Graham Dorrans at the Rangers is a confident man before the Rapid Vienna game
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians will provide them with their participation in the Group of the European League G, following the unexpected tie against the Spanish Villarreal.
Because of the knee injury of the middle court Graham Dorrans, he was unable to enter the season until the 2 to 2 game against Villarreal, but he feels that, building on this result, the Rangers can also set himself more bold targets.
“The point was a great team against Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we could get a point, and we brought a point.
Maybe we could've pulled a gol at the end, but we can't complain to the tie.
In the first semester, they were better, and we turned it on in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good at their last match, but with our fans behind our back, we'll definitely have the power to win.
Last year was quite difficult, I was injured, there were many changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We have a good team, the guys enjoy the game, the exercise goes well.
I hope that if we give it all up, we can leave the last season behind and achieve good results."
A lot of women worry about not saving enough money when they're old.
Those participating in the survey had an accurate idea of what age care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked to their family.
According to the Nationalwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their elderly care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them responded to this conversation with their children.
“Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually pick up the subject,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance business.
The following are worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to take care of you properly if you do not tell us in time what your needs are.
Together with his advisor and family, choose where and what kind of care he wants; these decisions will have a significant impact on the future costs.
Take in a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be done by means of a conventional insurance policy designed for old-age care, or a life insurance combined with hybrid savings, which can cover expenditure, or use as collateral to cover your own assets... if you have sufficient resources to add it.
Prepare the legal documentation: This will pre-empt the possibility of later litigation.
Trust a representative, a trusted person who works on your behalf on health issues, supervises your medical care and ensures that everything is expected to happen even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with his finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and arranges for the payment of invoices when you are unable to do so.
Remember the small details: Let's say your older parent is in medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please record these data in writing to make available at any time.

The victim in his 40s was attacked by Ilfracombe in Devon, Oxford Grove, on his chest, on his abdomen and on his hand.
The police described the shooting as a "unusual act" at local time around 02:30.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and fugitives in Indonesia
They lost their lives on at least 384, when there was a major earthquake on Friday, and then a deserter hit the city of Palu in Indonesia.
The communication network in the area has also been damaged, so there has been no news of the Donggala government north of Palu, where it was the headquarters of the 7.5-strong earthquake.
More than 16,000 inhabitants were forced to evacuate.
Some important information on Palu and Donggala is available on Celebes Island:
The capital of Palu Central Celebesz Province, on the western coast of Celebes Island, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379 800 people in 2017.
He was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the city’s foundation when the earthquake and the tsunami struck him.
The governorship of Donggala lies more than 300 km along the northern coast of Celebese Island.
The population of the government – less than the province – was approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Central Celebesz is mainly characterised by fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowal, on the far side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Catrophasies Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years.
A refugee in 1938 killed over 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, West Donggala arrived at a fountain, and nine died.
Indonesia is located in the geographically active Pacific Fire Ring, which is why earthquakes are common.
Only a few of the larger earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a huge earthquake began on the western coast of the Province of Aceh, North Sudan, which launched a desert of 14 countries, demanding a total of 226 000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, and over half of the victims lost their lives in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong rheses shook the western coast of Sumát between the end of March and early April.

Federal prosecutors have requested a death penalty for the suspect of the New York terrorist attack.
The U.S. attorneys in New York are asking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the eight human lives terrorist attacks in New York City, and no execution has been carried out in the state since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov was driven by a truck rented from Home Depot on a bicycle ride on the streets of Alsó-Manhattan West Side Highway, several pedestrians and bikers.
In order to prove the lawfulness of the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed eight victims of the death penalty “with intent” and that he was injured in a “conditionary” position in the office of the U.S. Attorney General of the New York District.
According to the document submitted, any proof of both charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipovo was accused of 22 crimes, including eight-order blackmail killings, which were almost exclusively used to combat organised crime and damage and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack “required for significant planning and pre-conceived intent,” the prosecutors claim, and Saipov stated that he carried out his action “in an gross, cruel, inhumane manner.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pagnucco’s family.”
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.

Saipov, born in Egypt, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed to have filled him with pleasure.
Saipov said that ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of an attack, was in charge.
According to the police, he asked them to put out an ISIS thief in his hospital room.
All 22 charges confessed innocent.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipovo, said that they were “trended” because of the decision of the prosecutors.
“In our opinion, the actual loss of life in prison would have been more favourable than the confession of the government,” said Patton, “the death penalty would only prolong the sufferings of all those involved in the case”.
Saipov's defenders asked the prosecutors to refrain from asking for their death penalty.
According to a representative of Tory, NIGEL FARAGE should conduct the Brexit negotiations
On his protest during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage declared that "a man calls the army of the people into battle".
According to the former leader of Ukip, politicians must feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics after a partner of Theresa May pointed out that the negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to Farage.
The conservative Peter Bone, who did not submit to any office, told the participants in the Birmingham assembly that the United Kingdom would “as long ago have left,” if Farage were Minister for Brexit.
It is well characterised by the pressure within the Mayan party that Toryk left behind in another anti-Brex protest in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers Plan, which requires permanent separation between Brexit and the remaining parties and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose from his package or “the total chaos”.
Bone on the Leave Means Leave at Solihull (The exit means we're leaving) said that the "Chequers Act" has to be calculated.
He suggested that Farage be brought to the House of Lords and that it should be entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have quit,” he said.
He added: “I like Brexit, but I have to count with the Chequers Act.”
In criticising the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be servants of others.
We want to bring the laws of our own country."
Bone refused the assumption that since the 2016 vote, the public statement had changed: “There is no real reason why the British people had changed their opinion and wanted to stay.”
Andrea Jenkyns, representative of Brexit Party Tory, also attended the meeting and told the journalists: “All I ask is: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers Initiative rejects the public, the opposition will not vote, the party is unpopular, and especially the activists who work on the ground and have helped us get to the government.
Forget about the Chequers case and listen to us."
He added to May as a sarcastic message: “Only the Prime Minister can keep his seat, who will keep his word.”
At the meeting, Farage said that politicians should “get pressure” so as not to dare betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“ Trust between us, that is, the people and our politicians, has now announced the stake.
– They're trying to sell Brexit, and today we're gathering to compete, we won't let them do it."
With these words, he turned to the enthusiastic crowd: “I would like our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit to feel pressure.
We call the army of the people into battle to win the Brexit, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom is re-independent, independent, proud country."
At the same time, the remaining parties withdrew in Birmingham and held a two - hour meeting in the city centre.
Some activists launched the flag of the "Toryk against Brexit" movement this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party was on the conservatives because of safety errors at the opening of the conference.
“These people said that they had IT backgrounds for a Canadian plus-plus agreement, for non-promotional border crossings and for a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders.
- They're just talking to you.
It is simply not good Brexit," he stressed.

The Saturday afternoon event was a meeting in Holyoke in the framework of the 36th retail forum since Trump took office with voters.

Warren, in reply, said it was time for women “to play a role in the repression of a misdemeanor government in Washington, including the occupying of the highest position".
Arrested by the person suspected of shooting Sims in LSU
On Saturday, the police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that on Friday, they arrested the person who was suspected of the shooting of the basketball player at LSU, Wayde Sims.
The police station in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11 a.m. on the Eastern Coast time.
A video of the shooting on Friday was released earlier, and they asked for help to identify the man on the tape.
The 20-year-old Simst took the fatal shot early on Friday morning near the University of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims suffered head injury from the shooting that proved fatal”, informed Commissioner Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to the report of the 247sports.
He came in to protect Wayde's friend, and that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson at the interrogation admitted that he was on the scene, had a gun on him, and he shot Waye Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without an incident. The man was arrested at the East Baton Rouge Police Station.

Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton got closer to the title of the world champion after receiving the victory of Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team travels.
After qualifying himself to a better place at Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, Valteri Bottas immediately made clear that the Mercedes team's instructions will play a major role in the race.
Bottas, who was not starting from the position, started off well, and almost got Hamilton into trouble because he was protecting his position in the first two circles, which enabled Vettel to attack his teammate.
At first, Vet was in the boxing game, and he let Hamilton grab himself in the traffic behind the middle field, which should have proved to be decisive.
Mercedes came out with a circle later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot left the inner stone untapped after moving twice as a defense against the third canary.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, left the back row of the track blocks, and by the end of the first round it was the seventh.
After that, most of the race was driving because of the fact that there was no change of tires, so that he could quickly reach the target and prevent Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, it was on the 44th round, but the remaining eight times couldn't increase its pace, so Räikköne became the fourth place.
“It was a great day because Valtter did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let go.
The team had an exceptional job to get the first two seats," said Hamilton.
Your body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because the senator insisted that she did not leak Christine Blasey's letter to accuse him of sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony of Ford made before the Senate Committee on Justice, but only noted that things in the Senate show that people are “problems, haters and liars”.
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days when people see anger when they see people are angry, ominous, hateful, and lying,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... Did you leak the document? – Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, let's stop for a second.
No, we didn't leak," he did, imitating the senator.
A letter detailing charges against Kavanaugh Ford sent Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked at the beginning of September. Feinstein, however, denied that the source of leaking was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and leak his story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to the report of The Hill.
"He asked me to handle it confidentially, and I also treated it confidentially in accordance with his request."
However, it seems that the president who noted at the Saturday evening meeting did not accept his refusal: “I will tell you what the situation was: his body speech was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to protect the candidate of the Supreme Court for sexual harassment accused of three women that the Democrats used alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They were determined to regain power by whatever means.
They can see disbelief, hatred, they don't care who they're hurting, who they have to run to to get power and control," quoted the President's words Mediaite.

According to the latest report from an air carrier operating in Micronesia, a person has disappeared, although it was previously claimed that the evacuation of both 47 passengers and crew was successful from the substation.
According to Air Niugini's press release, there's no record of a man in the afternoon situation.
According to the airline, they're working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.

The events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented the defendant to the man at his retrial, accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has been presenting information analysis experts for hours.
He met with the jury how he put together his cell phone records using the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellers and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the woman's death.
According to Rowlett, he received location data from multiple phones, which suggests that he was with Order Chambers the night of the woman's death, which contradicts the man's earlier claims, the Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford made his statement on Saturday, during which he said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellas was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was “sounded because Nashville had my truck”.
Another contradiction was that Tellers said that she knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
According to cell phone records, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers died, Tellers deleted her text messages, calls and contact details from her phone.
“He wiped her out of her life, ” said Hale.
Protection is scheduled to start a closing discussion on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be before the jury that day.

Another black one?
The New York nanny sued for the dismissal of a party after a "rassist" message
A New York nanny sued for the dismissal of a couple of discriminations after a wrong message sent to her, the mother complained that they were able to use a black herd again.
The couple deny that they're racist and that the case is like "scratching".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her disappointment when the new child care provider Giselle Maurice arrived in 2016 saw her black on the first working day.
"NIGHT, I WON'T WON'T BE A JOB," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of your husband, Ms. Maurice sent the message to twice.
According to the New York Post, after he woke up, Plasco-Flaxman himself fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the leaving nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was more like a filipine watch.
Ms. Maurice paid one day's work and then sent it home with a Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for the dismissal and asking for 350 dollars a day for the six-month job that was originally hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them to stop on the way, you can’t do this,” said the Post on Friday, adding: “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations against racism that it was reasonable to eliminate Maurice's application because they were afraid that they could not trust him after he was violated.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone who, by any chance, was being rude?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
According to Plasco, her wife was born two months ago and “was in a very difficult situation.”
"Can anyone attack that?
It is not really a good thing to do that," added the investment banker.
While the legal procedure is being carried out, the public court has already quickly condemned the party in the social media, their behaviour and logic.
According to a letter just found, the publisher of Paddington was afraid that readers would not be able to tie him to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “Look for yourself to be someone who reads before he published it.
This information is quite fun right now when we know how great success Paddington is."
According to his statement, his father, who worked as the cameraman of the BBC, before he was inspired to write a little book about a playbook, would not have been difficult if his work had been refused, and he added that his 60th anniversary of the book had succeeded in the summer of his father's death last year.
Paddington was called “a very important member of their family” and added, his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, and he wasn’t at all envisioned, ” he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who takes something: we are proud of it even if it is not really our merit.
I think that's how Paddington's success was seen.
Although he created it, and he was made out of his imagination, he always attributed himself to the credit of Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
At the time of landing, his daughter was dragged to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice where doctors fought futilely for his life.
“They regularly called me to tell you that he was in a very bad state and that they did not expect him to survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nad, saying that my daughter will die in the next two minutes, and I must thank her.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave him to keep beating his heart slowly ran out and left his body.
He died a long time ago, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait for everything to be over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a place surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, when she was grieving for her daughter's loss, she got into the plane with the others who didn't care about the trial she just went through.
“ Nobody knew, ” he said.
“I fell off my head, and my tears were all over me.
It's hard to explain, but I felt that compassion for them on that plane.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew she loved my daughter very much."
With grieving women for the prevention of suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent them from throwing away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put out inspirational postcards and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same thing I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and his smile was on everyone.
“He knew about everyone’s smile.
They always said his smile would throw up any place."
But before he died, he gave up his job because he was “very bad.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was then found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was worried that this would cause some sort of domino effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards with the purpose of “to let people know, there are people who can be contacted and talked to them, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit still – you have to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, who's been missing Ms. Davis' girlfriend for years, Mark, who's been a lifelong partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of the man's mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in your attitude.
He was all under his feet on Christmas Day: when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look in their eyes and they were like this."
He said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they must cope with it: “He left a great space in the family.
He broke our heart into small pieces.
But we must continue the fight."

Questioned Brett Kavanaugh's future, as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could achieve what he asked for, a limited, limited-time investigation – perhaps we can reach agreement” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee was “departmented” because of the party’s failure to decide.
Why were Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters opposed the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be known as timing.
The interim election is only five weeks, on 6 November, and if it is expected that the Republicans will not perform well, it will be much harder for them to bring their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby with Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and he also met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes your report?
The Senate has a vote in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow the Vice President, Mike Pence, to decide whether to enter Mr. Kavanaugh into the Supreme Court.
Number of dissidents in North Korea under the control of "lower" Kim
The number of dissidents in North Korea since Kim Jingongun came into power seven years ago, declared a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Bjongsok quoted the data of the Southern Interconnection Department and said that in the last year, 1127 were dissidents compared to 2011, when that number was 2706.
Park said that the closer border guard between North Korea and China and the higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
The majority of North dissidents finally get South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between Korea.
Dissidents are accepted as illegal immigrants in China, not as refugees, and are often returned by violence.
The practically still war-to-war relationship between North and South has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leader of the two countries met in Phenjan, and their discussions were at the heart of the blocked nuclear decommissioning negotiations.
This historic meeting in June was held between Mr. Donald Trump and President Kim Jingongun in Singapore, where they agreed on further cooperation with the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho has accused the United States of sanctions because of the lack of progress.
“In the absence of confidence in the Americans, there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible to imagine our unilateral removal of our weapons,” Ri said in his speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "historic", says he is unfit for the Supreme Court
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, appointed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, called it "historic" and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Texas Austin.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman behaved like this, I would call her “historic” – Pelosi’s reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh, which was made before the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested against rumors that he would have sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassey in their teens.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he was screaming and his voice was also closed when he talked about his family and his years spent in high school.
In addition, he specifically condemned the Democrats of the Committee, the charges against him, called "grotesk and coordinated character murder", organised angry liberals because of the defeat of Hillary Clinton in his presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi told me that Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was not qualified for work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I believe that he has excluded himself from his statements and the conduct he has shown against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to put Kavanaugh in charge, in case he filled the post, and if the Democrats acquired a majority in the House.
“I tell you that if you don’t tell Congress the truth or the FBI, you don’t just go to the Supreme Court, but you don’t go to the court where you are right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position in the capital appeal court.
Pelosi added that he was concerned about the possible decisions made by Kavanaugh as a democrat about the Law on Remuneration or the Roe vs. Wade case, because Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During the hearings of Kavanaugh, he excluded questions about whether to copy the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There is no time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to depart from joy,” stated Pelosi.
And women need to keep them in touch.
It's a legitimate run-out, and it's been over months and years, and you can't get rid of yourself without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is so rare, do you?"
“There was a woman who worked in a leadership position for me, ” she said to me that she was crying in rage, but she developed a technique that, when she started crying in rage, she told her talking partner: “You may think I’m sad because I cry.
But I am angry.”
And then he kept going.
And I thought that was a great idea."
In part, tears are viewed as a sign of anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most vibrant memories of an early job, an office dominated by men, where I once started crying in my angerlessness, that I was grabbed by an older woman – a cool manager, who I was always afraid of – and took me to the stairs house.
"Let them cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be satisfied because they managed to upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, Gary Harttal, worked on the presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with a non-marital affair on the bank called the Mokey Business, and therefore he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he thought there was no reason why he couldn't start for the presidency himself.
“There was no well-considered decision,” he said laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race and the new candidate was wanted at the center of their back.
Someone named him "Hówhite and the seven midgets".
Since the campaign has been running for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has been missing the money, so he's decided not to enter the competition unless he's picking up $2 million.
It was a battle for loss.
He realized that some of his supporters gave men 1,000 dollars, but he only got 250 dollars.
“ Did they think I would get a discount? ” he reasoned.
When he held a press conference that he would not launch an official campaign, emotions were so irritant about his thanks to the people who supported him, as well as the system of frustration and the rage of sexism, which directly affected voters.
“It was believed that I had a nervous breakdown,” said Ms. Schroeder, “how the press responded to it.
“It was believed that Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were gonna write on my gravestone?
“Sirt”?"
How can the US-China Trade War be good for Beijing?
The opening line of the US-China trade war was almost earring, and the same battle has not even ended yet, according to experts, the break between countries may benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, president of the US at the beginning of the year, launched the first warnings by taxing the key Chinese export products, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant innovation took place this week, as the new duties already affect a USD 200 billion product, practically taxing half of the goods from China to the USA.
In every case, Beijing cut back, the last time it took a customs duty of between five and ten per cent, to a US product worth USD 60 billion.
China has made a vow that it will strike back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you wanted to get Washington to back off, it would mean that you'd have to file a release in front of the demands, but public drive to the U.S. would be awkward for Hisi Chin-ping, president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is doing well, the US's trade pressure could be good for China in the long term because it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing that could lead to economic revolutions in any of the economies of the two countries is much more serious than the observers have previously recognised,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant in Asia at the brainstorm called New American Security.
Syria " is ready" to return refugees, claims the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to ask for help to rebuild the land that has died over seven years of war.
In his speech before the United Nations Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valed Moallam claimed that the state's conditions are improving.
"The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government will continue to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country whose lives and lives were affected by terrorism and economic measures taken by their own authority.
According to UN calculations, over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people living in this country need humanitarian help.
Moalem told me that the Syrian state welcomes all assistance in rebuilding the country.
But he stressed that there was no conditional assistance or cooperation from countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe acquired the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the U.S. team 16,5:1,05 per cent of Le Gold National was held outside Paris.
The U.S. has now fallen six times in Europe and hasn't won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has protected its champion's title because the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player, struggling all the way down the tower, put his hit in the water at the par-3 16, giving Francesco Molinari this victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari was brilliant among everything, so he became one of the 4 players who has ever achieved the 5,0 results since the tournament started in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth has received 5&4 from the lowest player in the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1, against Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder-cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, were the best European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t cry at night, but I couldn’t stop today.
It was a pretty tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy I got the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I am happy to be able to help," he said after the European victory of the emotionally struggling Garcia.
The staphtub is handed over to Jon Rahm, who won the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, alone on Sunday 2&1.
“I feel incredibly proud that I defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up listening to this man,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now he's got a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 titles and only Jack Nicklaus gets ahead of us.
The U.S. team's been fighting all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing outcome, the United States team captain, Jim Furyk, said: “Pick up at these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we were setting fire to Europe.
We fought.
Down with the hat in front of Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will group our team, work with the American DGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love this 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to raise your hats.
The opponent was better than us."
