A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a Sanfranciscoese mall.
Only a 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead at the local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to harm his brother. "He had finally got his business in order."
The body found in Westfield's mall on Wednesday morning was identified as Sanfranciscolic Frank Galicia, who was 28 years old, reports San Francisco Law Office.
San Francisco Police Department says death is being investigated as a homicide.
Brother Louis Galicia of the victim told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, previously working as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he got to San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant to be a chef six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family. We're sorry we're big," the representative says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells me that Frank first lived in Hostelles, but he finally got his business in order.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to the KGO Station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was nice and big-hearted.
His way of being together with the family was to put food on all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went through the river.
Despite all the injustice that occurred in the world, he was an unbroken diamond that was cast every day," he says.
All roads on this case will be asked to call San Francisco Police Department tip number 415-575-4444.
Juvenile junior doctors call for new measures to combat work
Representatives of British junior doctors (who are primarily responsible for specialist doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and have requested permission to take new work fights in the dispute on a new employment agreement.
The JDC Committee, represented by the British Medical Association (BMA), is calling for support from its whole government for further work fighting activities from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved contract problems.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in the July vote.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday night, Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, published a letter he sent to JDC members, where he says that the government "has been so self-sufficient" questions that McCourt said led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter says: "In light of this, the JDC Government has completely rejected the proposal for a new agreement and calls for new formal negotiations to be held on all our concerns.
In response to the government's difficulties, the Government of JDC has today submitted a formal request to the Government of the BMA asking for permission to take least advanced work fighting operations since the beginning of September."
It is because of the dispute that junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, which included the first perfect job stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Mr Malawana, head of the BMA junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms which BMA recommended.
At the meetings required by the vote of the BMA members, Malawi said that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will come into force and that it will apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: external alliance?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
On Tuesday, Russian and Turkish leaders met with the leaders of Russia in order to reach agreement and to conclude an official decision on the eight months term of word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I had a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
Yes, the parties served,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't get much heat at even with his own restraining standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyp Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin — five times according to a report.
I didn't keep the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, one of our country’s newspapers wrote Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing ever happened.
I myself understood his enthusiasm on the contrary.
But the constant violin of Putin showed that the Russian headman has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
The Moscow reaction at the time of the event was fierce.
Putin hit hard in the words against Ankara and accused him of stabling his back.
The accident was even bigger because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state's most controlled media was a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
But suddenly it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious accusations were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in regions controlled by Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has been emphatically denying the charges.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was arranged only for Putin to receive an apology from President Erdogan.
This allowed Russia to win some kind of victory.
The benefits of ankara’s declaration of the ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost out of control in the failed coup last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
It also has an economic impact.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter flight ban, as there are normally millions of Russian tourists travelling to the Turkish coast every year.
The amount has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be alert to facilitation when air transport can finally be continued.
They're putting their faith in the late season for a raid on the Mediterranean Sea.
And yet this week, state television has predicted that fruit and vegetables would fall as imports of agricultural products in Turkey are allowed again.
"The tourists there, the tomatoes back here", was formulated in the newspaper Vedemost article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, because it believes that the West responded to the coup attempt.
Not to forget the old plight of forward-looking Turkish accession negotiations and the lack of Putin in matters, which is eager to take advantage of cool spaces and to undermine Turkish ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankar when he expressed his support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, who has had his own concerns about the change of power.
Therefore, Russia and Turkey could, at their peak meeting at sea, pass on the image described by an analyst as a "outside alliance": two countries that experience their rejection and abuse of the West unite their forces.
Despite the public reconciliation, these two still have great differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It is much said that, after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, each president told us at a press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President was thinkingly refusing to answer the question of differences between countries, while Putin, in turn, stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete disaster caused by Turkey by NATO in the shooting of a Russian combat machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are back on the table.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the Governor of RBS, the Bank’s activities outside Scotland are reduced by providing only business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the Bank’s global objectives.
The bank had to withdraw from its objectives when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and was forced to save.
During that period, brandists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored with millions of pounds of international sport, for example Six Nations -rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to have more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used with a shorter RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWeste, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchange listings.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and personnel at Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS will turn into an investment brand and because of the fact that we are now becoming a much more diverse brand bank.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, they are local.
Each of these brands represents something very different in their own community, and our employees work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nationsrugby and has increased the profile of the different brands in sport sponsoring.
"Now is the time to turn into a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank a better client," says the President of the Bank.
"It would have been very nice three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and used the brand.
But our work and focus on the needs of our customers have changed a lot rather than our own needs.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory in Newmarket and won his 3 000.
The detector sprays champagne twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant to him 3,000.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3 000 victory in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
On this milestone he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice a night on the same night of his own location on the track. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
Italian Datori, 45, is the sixth jockey to achieve this level-playing race on the track.
He's got Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, Willie Carson.
Three-time master jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyaar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are down because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big competition event, not a Royal Ascot, but a very common Friday night and a 20 000 audience.
I'm relieved, and I feel great humility."
Ditor accepts cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached the official barricades competition, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20 times champion Sir Anthony McCoy who won in his record career more than 4 300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine times Derby winner, 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is not surprising that she has just reached this milestone, which only few have reached.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical advances are what separates him from others.
He is a fantastic representative for a race race, and his enthusiasm, and his furry, have brought supporters to the species for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6 000 contests if he hadn't competed only on weekends and only in big races!
In serious terms, Frankie's horse riding career in the UK has been a victory for nearly 30 years, which has been a great follow-up.
He is a living person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dentor fants are achieved in a typical way by flying down his horse back.
"From flying finishes to flying landings Frankie Dettori has been an example of the British racing race for two decades already.
There's been a lot of ups and downs on the way.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a flight accident and has been banned for abuse of medicines.
When the ban on competition three years ago ended, he had trouble starting up, but he showed a remarkable nature of strength, looked to suspects and returned to his best.
And he's not going to finish his career for a while yet – the Dator has recently said that he wants to continue to compete until at least 50 years old."
Putin was segregated by Head of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly resigned his Head of Administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's believed inner circuit for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to Kremlin's announcement, President Puti 's decision to release Ivanov as Head of the Russian presidential administration' was not made, but the reasons for the dismissal were not mentioned.
Anton Vaino, Deputy Head of Mission of Ivanov since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Pino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has worked previously at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's protocol department and the government's office, reports the Russian website of Kremlin.
In his appointment, Vaino thanked Putin, saying: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your efforts as Head of State, which means making legal drafts and controlling how the guidelines you have adopted are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are you smiling real?
This movement has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been around Vladimir Putin, and, like Putin, he has a KGB past.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on TV, the Russian state said that Ivanov would withdraw from the task at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations only convince very few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are you fired from some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been praised as President suddenly wishes to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me the responsibility for this very complex and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
"Now I've been president's manager for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB.
When Putin worked as Head of the KGB Security Service (FSB) for replacement of the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his Deputy Head of Mission in the late 1990s.
As he entered Putin, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was then thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after the second period, since the Constitution would prevent Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another Dmitri Medvedeville nearby Puttin.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI investigators series star Thomas Gibson got fired after he fired the producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the crime scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios companies producing series reported kicks in their joint announcements.
As Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, known in the series, had filed an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry it happened here", he says when he's in the paper.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, reported in ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in this series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in his release on Friday.
"I wanted to see it all the way to the end of the show, but it's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important ones: the best fans that a series could ever have hoped for."
Series 12 production season starts on September 28 in the United States.
The mysterious beaching of fish in the Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, living in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windmills that have landed on the face of a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published a screen of pictures in Periscope and hoped to find an answer to these five-centre fish.
The Queensferry bridge is now connected to Fife
The project of GBP 1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern deck and the land bridge of the Queensferry bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It is the first of the four parts between the "false threats" which are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 vinified resins.
The project of GBP 1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister of Economic Affairs, visited the country today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant advance in building a bridge, and more than 30,000 concretes and steel have been used exclusively to build this bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, building a bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a delicate operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete coin in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to be brought into place."
Michael Martin, the head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, says: "The completion of the first bridge is always an important urban waste in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water construction sector.
After the last section of the roadside was installed and attached to the road map of the North Tower, then we had to close the remaining section of the northern (i.e. the terrestrial) gap.
This was done by drawing 700 millimetres south of the northern side of the bridge.
This was a massive and at the same time a high degree of precision operation.
Massive, because of the length of the country of 222 metres and the weight of about 6 000 tonnes, it was to be drawn up at a slope angle of about 3%.
And a great deal of precision, since the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small — just a few millimetres.
I'm glad everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells me about the miracle of three men
Anglesey represented three men in their fishing boat who were saved by miracle.
Moelfre RNLI's marine rescue station made an alarm on Friday at 13.20 local time its crew detected an accident in Moelfre Bay Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued to pass a reckless journey without a pilot.
"We saw the boat orbit right next to them and imagined the worst", says Vince Jones, who runs Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By then, when we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately transported the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, 60 years old, was found exhausted in the trap and without lifeboats.
All of them were taken to the coastboat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men on water are still alive and in perfect condition.
There was an emergency extinguisher on the boat’s engine, but for some reason it had disengaged from the boat’s timed man when it crashed.
They really had luck on their way."
Pokémon Go was hunting for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but prefer to stay inside and stare at their screws.
Pokémon Go makes people rise on the couch and move.
Originally, it took only TV to watch, then video games and the latest smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and the field are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I am referring to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (of which later it was also a drawing series, playing cards and other accessories).
As with many popular cultural phenomena, this also stolen slightly before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Lanserius in other countries was delayed by a huge interest that overloaded servers.
In just a few days, the user number of Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players are going out looking for pokémons on their smartphones, which are monitored by GPS. When you find it, it can be "light" (with the help of the phone display) or "compatible".
The villing has played with it a video game that played a generation younger and raised the backs from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps to take in a day by the average person.
Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch Cardiogram app, which discovered within two days of the game launch that 30 minutes of the day the number of people moving suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35 000 users.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go game for users, it only sees the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to rise from the couch and move at least 30 minutes a day have echoed deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people seem unhappy.
However, the importance of mobility must not be reduced.
Regularly moving probability of being infected with cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps in weight control, decreases blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a high amount of other benefits.
The fine thing about Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic things that support health — sports, fresh air, and sun and joy.
It's even possible to make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, even this phenomenon has been affected by the ridiculers.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door when they're playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough is complete.
For though smart phone applications like Fitz may have followed your activity earlier, they did not give reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The alarm of the news disappears, and the use decreases in time.
The success of Pokémons will, however, be accompanied by more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, thus increasing the exercise of people leaving the yacht and improving their condition and health.

Simone Bales caught gold in women's artificial gymnastics complexion
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jumping.
Simone Bales is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jump.
I don't care about the boom.
The jaws are breaking up with the permano.
That's great.
And now finally the Olympic winner.
The American 19-year-old tennis gymnast won the Championship on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic light field.
His total score was clearly better than that of a silver teammate, Aly Raisman and Russian Prossimist Aliya Mustafina.
The United States Simone Bales is in the boom of the multi-stakeholder race for women at the Rio Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The party became the fourth successive, and the fifth American woman of all time who won the championship of the multitask, thus strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Bales bit me in tears when his final points came visible and his long way this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species to a whole new dimension and brings him to the same class as other superstars of sports, such as Michael Phelps:
Bales has been totally overwhelming in his species for the last three years. He has won 15 World Championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with so ambitious and accurate programs that the Olympic Winner Mary Lou Retton of 1984 said to him, "the greatest transgressor of all times".
There was yet one last competition in Brazil, mainly between the burden of Bales and himself and the excessive expectations, not so much between the Bales and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring Texas, less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
The United States Simone Bales (left) and Aly Raisman hug the gold and silver in the finals of the women's artificial gymnastics match at the Rio Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
The party won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point to Martha Karoly's homework, who is now retired.
Although Bales claimed that he had never thought of anything before when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Some of his permanto program, which includes a volt set known as his handcard, has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The mother of Aimee Boorman has become a powerful figure. Boorman found a girl when this was a day-career's home in the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multi-stakeholder competition since summer 2013, and the winning pipe is likely to continue as long as Bales wants it to continue.
Despite being led by Mustafina on two tours, it was like fabrication.
There was a boom and a permanence in which Bales is the champion of the world.
He got back to the station after he got 15.433 points from the boom, and he screwed up the final result by 15.933 points from the permanate.
Raisman readily challenged him while waiting for final points — which was just a formality — and tears began to appear around the red, white, and blue eyebrowing color of Bales when his dream written in his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small renunciation to a four-year-old contest when he first divided his third place, but then lost to Blackfina the bronze in the re-run.
This time a 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call the team "mum" clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent plane kisses to the public after his Permanto programme and thus became a winner of the loss position, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Bales is concerned, this 19-year-old earlier week, with a wide-ranging tweet, has a whole new meaning:
The police tell us three music in the car, listening to the victim of a serial killer who's been killed.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating massacre in Phoenix for ten years. Victims sat in the car talking and listened to music when they were shot, reports police announcements published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a parked car on the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled with another car, says the press.
The police suspect that the cause of the trial was not a robbery because the attacker didn't take the purses or the $2,900 found in the hearing of another adult victim.
Officer of Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard now says the police are investigating whether the death is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two wounded in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in the regions of Latin America within four months.
"It is common to the parties that they have been in residential areas at home," Howard told CBS’ subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan at the end of the 1990s, the black BMW at the end of the 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and that they are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken for her injuries to a hospital where she died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The witness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a release telling us that the open van was empty only half an hour before the triple death, and that the shooter was believed to be the same in either case.
The researchers found seals and took a bullet from the car seat and a bullet in the engine space.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microkefal: "The things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Piccito likes singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other age friends, Edmund has a microkefal, or born smallpox due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuto’s genetic disorder, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
"When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I wouldn't make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not committed to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never identify them and perhaps survive at all.
Some doctors went so far that they suggested that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any such practice anymore," says Picciu.
Edmund walks with the rollers.
Edmund got up to sit down and started holding until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving on to his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's invention with a sign that she means "list for me".
"We'll teach him sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean the usual sign language, but it also includes the links that Edmund himself invented.
Microkephalia may have a variety of diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund’s, or premature viral infections, such as mumps or zizavirus.
There is a wide range of symptoms and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those with the zicoviral virus.
Picciut is remembering the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
"I kept saying, "What happens to us,
"what happens to us."
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction in a while, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Piccito has hope - giving advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by zicovirus.
"The things are getting better.
It's the way things work out.
"You love your child, and your child loves you."
The heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana announced the heavy rainfall of emergency and the widespread floods, and hundreds are expected to come to the state on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers in south-eastern Louisina and South Mississippi flood over their springs and spread over a wide range as a result of heavy rainfalls.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards reports that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on their way to flood zones.
Mike Steele, the informant of the national security and emergency preparedness office, reports requests from the Agency for flood vehicles, boats and sandheads.
According to Steele, only the county of Tangipahoa has requested tens of thousands of sands.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the weather service, water may be added to the area 76-127 mm.
In southern Albania an flood warning was given on Friday when rain continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, each in Louisiana, is predicted to rise to record heights.
According to the weatherman Alek Krautmann, many of the buildings on the rivers may be subject to flood in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that floods in the county of Ascension pose a threat, for flooding rivers are slowly emptying Lake Maurepas.
In Louisiana Liverpool, the Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state of Mississippi, was already higher than ever on Friday 9 a.m.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amis and Wilkinson in South-Misssip.
Leroy Hansford, her wife and her boyfriend were previously near Glosster among the saved ones on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, normally over 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other half of the nearer had warned him.
"We rose up, and water came on a continuous feed," Hansford says.
"It spread to my waist."
Her wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high during the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he and his family have all the injuries, and he himself is the only swimmer.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military-style trucks and brought them to the fire station in Glosster, where they kept protection on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly when heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of the information received from an observer close to Livingston that nearly 350 mm had taken place between midnight and Friday morning.
According to Krautmann, soil accumulated strongly after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities say that because of the flooding of heavy rains and streets, the inhabitants of Tangipahoa county were forced to be saved from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council in Tangihoa had informed CBS’ subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
Regional Director Robby Miller tells us that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets who had remained prisoners of the flood.
Evacuated shelters have been opened up in the cities of Amis and Hammond.
"They'll be able to get back into their homes when the water starts to pull away," he says.
In the city of Hammond, nearly twenty streets in Tangipaho, had to be shut down because of the flood, and the inhabitants were offered sands to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"For the last time we had a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a city government member.
"This flood looks like it."
In Mississip, the rain continued as smooth on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Ruby Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday, there was a report of a house under a handful of floods, but on Friday, there had so far not been a single one.
The manager of the Shopper Value Foods store Keith Townson says he's been living in the Amite region for 40 years now.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
Several bullets into his body, 6 years old Majah Brown, survives the shooting incident in Philadelphia
According to the police, a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who's already been six years old, who's been shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told me that the boy on CBS Philadelphia channel was Majah Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds in his neck, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said his grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe it."
The boy's in critical condition at the hospital, and he's had multiple surgery.
The family tells the television company that they think the boy's gonna make it.
He was about to start first class at local level.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old men were also subject to the shooting.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the TV company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and now the police are investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between many armed men.
The scene was full of assault weapons-type seals, originating in various types of assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was the ongoing battle.
There were seals on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters and they have been actively involved in shooting", Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaaldi of the Philadelphia Police Department, told the TV station.
The bullets also hit houses and vehicles in many areas.
No arrests have been made, and I'm told the police are going through surveillance videos.
The second victim of the shooting this week was a six-year-old girl whose hand was struck by a mistrust while playing on Tuesday in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
In this name, I invite the Olympic team of women's artificial gymnastics, and there are more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everything proud.
At last, the team represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best woman-to-be fighter has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were on wing 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became a surprise winner, and America as a whole.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the amazing and mastery of artificial strength.
Simon became the fourth successive American on Thursday, who won gold in a women's race of individual competitions.
The teammate, Aly Raisman, won silver.
The views are at the top of the species, but the same does not seem to be the case with artificial gymnastics throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), because in the next Olympic team of tennis gymnastics there will be only four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that teline gymnastics is a expensive sport and gymnastics are mainly engaged in private telecommunications platforms, which are maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coachers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
Most of the premises of the Transnistrian Networks are located in prosperous residential areas which are able to support operations.
The teaching of the industrial forces takes place in these clubs, and it means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of the gymnastics.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haley have both trained species professionals since they began the gymnastics exercise.
We need to organise a more affordable and accessible training for many young girls whose enthusiasm has been raised by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own research project 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have provided free or affordable opportunities for over 15 000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin Americans), and these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown in Detroit, so that we can offer high quality artificial gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic race.
The physical strength develops strength, flexibility, coordination of the body, and teaches hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and work life.
This team has aroused enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start out with artificial gymnastics, and it's amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many different young girls from a background to start their way into well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strikes
Ministers wished to decide on changes to remuneration and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association), but 58% of those who participated in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt reported plans to make the agreement mandatory and said that the UK public health system (NHS) is "not in any country" and that all further delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that will include changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Mr McCourt, chairman of the Committee on Juniors, issued yesterday's opinion, saying: 'The senior physicians are still very careful about the proposed agreement, and it is particularly feared that it will speed up the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we need to move forward now because the time is running out.
The BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant to take up discussions and, at times, not even reacting in any way.
Even though I saw Jeremy Hunt making a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be prepared to take new measures to combat work."
The previous strike at the end of April delayed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consultants were requested to support the strike in support of law enforcement doctors.
Ministers wished to conclude the dispute on changes by concluding a renewed agreement with professionals from the British Federation.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors, which would be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS, appealed to junior doctors that they would not come to the new laws.
Mortimer says: "Employment measures achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at extreme limits and cause concern, anxiety and disturbances for patients, health care personnel and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the overseer and the disclosure of irregularities.
Workers were hoping to continue their positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, further training to return to careers, training costs, mutual recognition of the programme, study-free and gender pay gap – as a sign of the seriousness of workers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health, who want to stick to agreements concluded with the BMA in November, February and May."
In the day n.2,40 €, the cost of the medicine can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about € 2.40 per day when they recommended that it be given to more people and for longer periods of time.
The anti-erythropoietin ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinicalexcellence) has been advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinicalexcellence) who is a member of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and assessing new treatment methods has advised patients that ticagrelor should be given for four years in order to reduce further the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people get a heart attack every year, one in four of which reoccurs or have a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fat substance that generates posters in the wall of blood vessels.
If the patch is torn, it can give birth to a blood clot that prevents blood from getting into the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is released, it can go with the blood circulation and prevent the blood flow to the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca in Britain, sold by Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of floods.
The NICE draft guidelines published today recommend that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a 60 milligram reduction of the dose and aspirin given twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, assessing the introduction of treatment methods, says: "Even though effective treatment is available to prevent disease progression and the development of symptoms effectively, up to a quarter of patients with heart attacks receive a new scene or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of a return can have a very negative effect on the quality of life of man.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular with regard to bleeding risk, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period of time.
As a result of the electoral climate of political correctness, there was a boom in the Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year for corruption, and the government made a report.
The climate of political correctness led to the close of eyes from a widespread election village in Muslim communities, reveals today the Government's report.
The former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticised the police, election observers and city councils for breaking their eyes on the electoral scene "for the sake of presidency and over sensitivity to religion".
According to Pickles, previously known as the Regional State Minister and today as a force figure against corruption, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form security chains outside voting positions so that the feared voters could be protected.
He proposed that voters present a identity card in order to prove their identity when they came to vote.
At the moment, the voter should only state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be soaked in unexploited music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
I think we should protect more publishers," says Sir Eric.
He calls for journalists to be better able to access government documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
"It is not only about preventing elections, but also about fighting fraud against corruption and economic interests and their popularity in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report following the vote scandal in East London Tower Hamlet.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered that Mr. Lutfur Rahman should be distinguished from his duties in view of corruption and a number of illegal practices.
The court considered that Rahman 's 'discriminately' his Muslim community's religious sense and silenced his critic by accusing them of racism and Islam.
Rahman was said to "use his campaign as the basis for the religious obligation of every believer in Muslim to vote for him".
Up to 300 voices were questionable or misguided by the sound of a person acting as some other person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of the whistles all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the postal election, where senior members of the Muslim community were told that they pressured people to vote on the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric made a number of suggestions to clear the voting system, including the requirement of ID at the voting point.
The report states: "There is evidence that some members of the ethnic minority groups in vulnerable situations, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, and this was particularly the case in Pakistan and Bangladesh-backed communities."
"We were concerned about the fact that... the state institutions had blocked their eyes on such activities as "politically correct" because of ethnicism and over sensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to ensure that the system could be smooth, including banning the handling of postal tickets from political activists, so that "noise" can be prevented.
The review report on Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on the link between registrations in order to prevent the use of voting rights to immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider options where voters would be required to present a identity certificate before voting.
So that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Set the limit of three years for an automatic mail vote on requests.
Prohibition of the handling of votes sent by mail and mail envelopes from political activists.
The police have the right to form security chains around voting positions.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to increase the fear charge under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allow English in voting positions (except Wales).
Increased training to ensure that staff control rules allow only one person to go to the voting box at a time.
Sir Eric is emphasizing the London police, and he thinks it's "sufficient" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Election Court resigned from the task of Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and a number of illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty of no suspicion to warrant, and the criminal law display threshold exceeded many criteria."
He also criticised the inefficient "grassing checks" of the departments responsible for the election lists of the City Council.
"The decision given last year by the chair in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and hidden election whistle and its denial by some people."
The equality of the Olympic biker with the Duke Catherine and other twin creatures at the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games were wilded this week by a French biker named Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose attitude with the Queen of Cambridge is amazing.
But, according to discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete who is fighting the championship with a known person.
In honor of the well-known faces in our screen screens in Rio, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympics whose view of Hollywood publishers is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Catherine's dual existence on the bike tracks, many people have listed in social media how one of the bows could be an actor's double brother, Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his images, where he suddenly resembled the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted that he had heard from a child that he reminded DiCaprio.
"I don't see a match that big, maybe apart from beards and fives," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In London 2012 the British long-term jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were treated, which will undoubtedly show even more in these races.
The great and prominent Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the double existence of the Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been comparing Matthew Morrison, known as the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "atletic version" of an Inception movie actor.
Similarly, for a long time there has been a listed tennisist named Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who highlight both strong eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist, Yulia Efimova, Russia, reminds actor Annalynne McCord, and not just because of his beautiful skin and white hair, while Nathan Adrian, the United States team, according to his fans, is an "atletic version of Joseph Gorgon Leviv. "
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the Dexter series actor Jennifer Carpenter (i.e.), resemble each other from their face shapes and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was happy when others also saw a match.
This user wonders if there's a good reason for a couple's identity.
A Twitzer recently expressed his joy when "the rest of the Internet agree with Hope Solon and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the Dexter-series actor really resemble each other alarmably from their faces and eyes.
Many have also seen the match between Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's smiles and gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna will come back!
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for the Chinese swimmer's "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth instead of women's 4 x 200-metre release message stunned CBC's direct Olympic Report viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian public radio company CBC has been forced to apologize since one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer's "lost smell" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 meters release message.
MacDonaldi, who was admitted to CBC's clearing team to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
It was too excited, he left at speed, and he died like a pig.
"Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at the second part of the message 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck in Canada, making the Canadians catch up to China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly after being upset about the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane twiitta said, "Did the CBC explorer just say that a 14-year-old Chinese girl died like a pig?
"The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet."
In the final part of the 4 x 200 meters release message for women, Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as: "This small 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled Byron MacDonald with critical comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
The Twitiers didn't arrest their words when they heard how mindless Byron Macdonald was.
Twiittaja Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound racist.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC's broadcast, quickly regretted the comments made by MacDonald: "We apologize for the comments on the bathing mission.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that happened."
Finally, the CBC had to regret more than 90 times the people who had twitted as a reply to the comment.
A commentator colleague, Scott Russel, had to make excuses for MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued his apologies for more than 90 other twiitaja's comments on MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly submitted a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry, about these statements and about the fact that they were sent.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night, and we also apologized to our followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regret at the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it to be personal.
"I'd like to apologize for my comment that I gave last night after women's communication," said MacDonald at the Olympic Commission at the CBC.
"I've missed the swimmer's performance, not the person.
It is clear not to say that I did not mean by saying anything pathetic, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, prevented underwear in the middle of the trade made a woman shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to watch a woman get off in the middle of Primark to settle her underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his feet and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually experimented with four pair of underwear at the store at Bouverie Place.
The Primark chain at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping center, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the same time in the store, says that after testing underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says about what happened: "The people had no faith in their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the deal, took her underpants off the shelf, took her own stripes and underwear off and put them on.
He did not try to do it without any notice, but he did it with total shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took his underpants off his feet, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided that he didn't like them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks — and he didn't think about the person who would finally buy the underwear he had worked on."
Kent, 33-year-old Davidson, living in town, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone takes home the underwear that someone else used and hasn't washed."
It happened Tuesday afternoon.
“I have understood that the trading staff tried to remove these items from the sale after she had left — what is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and notice that someone else has had them without having them washed after," add Davidson.
Primark's informant commented: 'Primark is aware on Tuesday 9 August of the situation in Folkestone's movement.
All these products have been removed from the sale."
This is how you defend the armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the great master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Union in New York and asked him how to cope with a gun attack on a nearby robbery or abuser.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker according to whether the attacker approaches you for or behind you.
If the attacker approaches backwards, first you have to turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrach.
After this, hold the gun in such a way that it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and strike the attacker into your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker in the knee, and when he goes to pain double the factor, lean him on his face with a gun’s pipe and retreat by holding a gun on him.
The technology is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches from the front. You need to move away from the line of fire, grab the weapon and rotate it so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time put your weight in the gun, and the impact will attack the fist into the chest. Turn the weapon away from the attacker, back off and keep the weapon targeted at the attacker.
Does that sound awkward?
Look at the video how Mizrach does it.
However, remember that the safest way to get rid of the kidnapper is by giving away your cash — if you are not Krav Maga.
World Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and disaster reflexes on a hard test by licking Europe's dirtiest and most hostile places.
Ian Wright, 51, the Suffolki runner and travel guide author, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking the euro banknote, the handheld Piccadilly Circle, the train toilet washer and the Russian general telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a snowmeter to see himself and to show the viewers what was banned by pushing.
The experiment was made by documentary film Ian Wright — on the trail of internal power, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the bathroom’s washing machine may be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals in the gut to establish good bacteria and his or her own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused nothing but a bad-flavored mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his bowels by traveling around the world and by eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt the licking of railway stations' handrails and toilet wash-offs caused Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the paper, "I've been rather careless about my health since I was a child, and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth, like dirt, worms and fucking water."
In his film, he really showed his reputation as a tax collector.
The track was only received in a broken public bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
As a result of the comparison, it should be noted that the number is usually less than 60 in the newly sealed hands.
The track came against the Russian public bathroom where Wright refused to lick when the snowmimeter measured 4000 units — in newly burned hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright explains together in Valio's documentary film, Ian Wright – After internal power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the paper: "This is almost the smell of a terrible thing I've smelled in a bathroom.
4000 units, nothing is more dirty than that!
The place must be so disgusting that I'm really not licking anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film called Ian Wright — in cooperation with Valio following the internal force.
From Wright, Valio Gefilus, containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, was selected to help strengthen the intestinal good bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the category of snack, juice and novelty products in Valio, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time tell us about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally, we decided to ask Ia to join us."
Sulisto’s health has become a global trend.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
Sulisto’s health has become a global trend, and with the help of the document, we can provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, directed by the film, adds: "Let's say that I'd lost my respect for Ian if he'd licked certain items that we'd asked for, such as disgusting Russian water, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, the licking of certain objects was easier for Ian, while the portion was pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
In a survey conducted in 2015, 84% of respondents included lactic acid bacteria, in particular for the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58% reported that they used at least occasionally products with lactic acid bacteria.
The bully family destroyed the town-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
The bully family left behind 50 000 pounds of damage to the town's rental house after they had received a wedding due to the terrorism of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldo and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from his apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, following complaints against numerous couples.
After the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, the representatives of the rental company found that the dwelling was in a repair business.
The walls had horrid holes, floor boards were torn off, the trash was spread to the floors, and the walls were wrapped with graffiti.
The couple have now moved, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency (Cornwall Houston), says she is afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: "This has been a complete nightmare for people living here, no one should have to stand up for this.
There is much to weigh on because the property is likely to be known as not so pleasant as a part of Cornwall.
"The family is evil-like, as is its name."
According to the police, there were three boys who lived in the apartment at times. According to the police, the family was involved in street fighting on baseball grounds, intimidation of loved ones, drug use and communication, as well as loud screaming, fighting and cursing.
Skeldon, 47 years old, signed by the rental agreement, received a non-social code of conduct in June.
A house under the threat found old wastes in several rooms.
The house had previously been sold with drugs, and the floor boards had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought in the street and the police had to be called regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency evicted the couple by coercion this week after giving them an additional 11 weeks to move away voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the wedding — they said that their lives were from the earth to hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and that whole time has been hard.
Police have been here many times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we haven't used to it!
It's gonna be wonderful now that they're finally exhausted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, says that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited.
The trash and old toys had been thrown into the wilded wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a shame that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own and family conduct, as the weighting is always the last measure that Cornwall's housing agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the community who took part in the work and were courageous in providing us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of the neighbours and send out a message that non-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick tells us that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already in twenty.
The house was found in one bedroom after the wedding.
The housing workers now need to clean up the garbage bags around the house.
Police made a ride to the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis in addition to foams and other items, as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined when he was found guilty of holding class B drugs to sell it.
He claimed the money was in his car accident in 2013 for his dead son Lee Skeldon's gravestone.
After being homeless, Skkeldon and his husband have been heard to have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of a lot of rooms had been muffled with graffiti.
The police say they're calling for an adjustment to the tenants who break the rules on leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say this wedding is a clear warning to tenants who continue to threaten rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they want without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such conduct," says Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and non-social behaviour and continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying military jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced a shock in Portugal’s Aveiro.
The P-3C Orion aircraft from the Portuguese Air Force crashed into a frenzy low level.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were forced to flee when a low-air jet crashed over the full beach.
The dramatic images show how an army plane becomes almost exposed to the sandy nature of the tourists taking the sun in the North of Portugal Aveiro.
The vacationers got up in their feet when they were concerned, understandably, about the jet of the jets that began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The case happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the images and videos of a dramatic passing on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash on the ground."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing, and I was sure the machine would fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Aveiro experienced shock when the plane suddenly came and flew into the plowing low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels, which led to the fact that the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly slightly lower than normal because smoke caused by nearby forest fires damaged visibility, but according to the Air Force, it did not threaten anyone's safety.
The forest fires have destroyed the continent-Portugal parts and killed four people on Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility of the sand and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was equipped with a training flight in which the pilot was requested to identify fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the exam better than expected
The social and health district of Southern Karelia (Exote) did a better job in January - June of EUR 3.4 million than planned.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to decompose institutional care.
The care guarantee was carried out in all operations.
This year, Exote is trying to shorten the lines of action.
Exote will cover the deficit that has been created in the past by the surplus.
The remainder may be used to shorten the lines and to buy measures in patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exoten government will discuss the mid-term review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Guards swear on military light in Imvola
70 crew members of the Border and Coast Guard School took military vows on Friday.
The military elections of the Border and Coast Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
The Ten Special Borders Course lighting was organised at the sports field of the equipment.
There were 70 armed men who took the military vows.
Special border guards will be trained for demanding border safety, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied for a special limit.
They were called 250 for their choice.
Special border ice creams have been trained in Immola since 2007.
There were five veterans of the border forces during the war in connection with the outbreak.
The average age of those present is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A limited number of bandits ahead - criminal intelligence helps to investigate and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police agencies in Finland has been a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit is outside invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna belong to the Hämeen Castle.
It's pulled by a sergeant placed in Lahti.
He's a lead man. He's working for Lieutenant Lahde.
In addition, the strength of the unit belongs to a civilian person dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian suits.
The department has demonstrated its suitability and necessity, looks at Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides different investigations to other police.
It has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
Newest reform of working methods
The establishment of an analysis unit is the reform of the latest police working practices.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, that the police are increasingly less and less likely to leave the wars only when they get the alarm.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will target daily police activities where they are most needed.
The reform of the police administration led to the establishment of a criminal intelligence centre, under three national units, and each police station its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa in the context of the Central Crime Police will run its operations nationally.
PTR units are known to work for the police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, for their part, work with police departments in shared areas and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national units.
This information extends beyond its own territory.
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because it does so.
Those working in the RTA unit have better expertise in basic policies.
The unit seeks to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminals, or crimes similar to each other, through registers, alarm database and observations.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of this act, the factor is made up of a certain kind of image.
It can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Errors
The employees of the RTA unit do not run the streets in the city upright, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both criminals are not mentioned, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention companies.
The police are publicly reporting procedures if they are expected to pose a threat.
This case, for example, was a first - summer news, a way to record empty dwellings in housing accidents.
In that case, the factors put the house outside of the door a stick, a button pin or a tape board to try if the residents were really on their way.
The examination material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most clever ones order a protocol of law, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
The next time you steal gloves, you go hand in hand.
For this matter, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppus has been interviewed from the Hämä police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the police in Eastern Finland, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu police station and Detective Inspector Arto Tumela from Central Crime Police.
Police are collecting and analysing information that will help to plan practical activities.
In the context of a reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last amendment was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation gathers information from outside the boundaries of the organization and Finland.
A schoolgirl from London who joined Daddy was killed in Syria
News reports that one of the three British schools associated with Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer Tasime Akunjee tells her family that Sultana died in Syria Raqqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike in Raqqqa, a base for Isis in Syria, told the ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and her family said that she was just planning to run away from war and return to Britain.
"It can only be hoped that this will act as a warning example and will so that people can understand this is a real risk when they go to a war zone - and that will give up their decision to leave," says Akujee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other Eastern schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that sultana had been married to Isis fighter in Syria and had remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he's elected.
The Senate's Democratic President Harry Reid says he's convinced that the presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, is appointed as the Supreme Court of Merrick Garland, if elected President.
The Senate Republicans have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority leader Mitch McConnell, the next president is to elect a person who is to fulfil the seat of Judge Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court.
At the telephone conference on Thursday, Reid said that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with great certainty".
The editor of Reid later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton whether this was going to be Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "draw the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the American Court of Appeal in the Columbian District Court.
Reid says that Republicans that prevent Garland's appointment are presidential candidate Donald Trump's "hands" and "pre-deductors".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to the Treats magazine, the calendars are as well for women as for men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market a calendar made in the 1970s style and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of modeling, they want to find the top models of their NU Muse calendar next generation.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, told me earlier this year that his nakedness paper differs from the Playboy magazine of the old school, because he says, "Playboy is for men.
I'll do this to women."
Apparently, he thinks about the calendar the same way.
"We must bring back the timeless and classical nakedness, where women, as well as men, can easily enjoy and inspire these praiseful images of the female body," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
As a model, they want to send their photos online or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: Who buys records?
Lone men, middle-aged men, they like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a comment on the title of your angry protest, EiväKaikkiMisty-old Men, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to youGov research firm, the boom of millennial-sucking is not behind the new arrival of many spoken vinyl plates, while millennials want to feel the physical object in their hands, but rather the background of the middle-aged nostalgic.
The most likely age of a person who has recently bought a vinyl album is between 45 and 54.
In fact, age groups 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just a desire for hobbyists to miss records, but the importance is emotional: older vinyl disc buyers are more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% v. 53%) and enjoy their singleness (66% v. 66%).
But do you think youGov's results are true?
If this blog were a television broadcast, the camera would follow me walking along the flashy Soho Street, wearing a gray jacket. I would flash out, bend my hand into a cup and say something about traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rusty, while hotels, the Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there is still a handful of special record stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I am looking very close to men visiting these shops and trying to assess their age and character.
The Glasgowan Stuart, 55, followed by a Sister Ray movement (at that time by two young women, three middle-aged men) at the Reckless Records (at that point, eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-five women) is on a meeting trip in London during the afternoon and spends an extra time on the provision of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have some 3,000 to 4,000 albums."
These records fill the wall of his living room, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me the picture by e-mail, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so much albums and singles is partly in his available income. He now has the ability to buy discs that he could not afford when they first appeared and to re-purchase things that he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"There are a lot of stories in the late '60s and the early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get 'em," he says.
He agrees that the purchase of vinyl plates is more likely to be introverts that enjoy their company and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my bad."
Wez, who works at Sister Ray's 25th, also believes that many of their clients are suitable for YouGov's profile.
However, he has found a new kind of human flow that has been affected by media arrest, and these people have heard of the return of vinyl plates and now feel forced to buy their old records back.
"In my discussions, people had usually abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain the boom of certain age-old vinyl peas.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the sound records?
Only in a few seconds at a movement like Phonica realizes that they offer comfort to similar types of community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have suffered particularly from the contactless payment system.
The digital world may hack into parts of vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar disk boxes means permanence and reminds of the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills some hole or material property into some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe that so many others too.
It's an easy way to get your mind off."
"We're like social workers!" goes after Wez's co-workers.
The ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of those who bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The survey also reported that 41% have a record player, which they never use, and 7% of people buying a vinyl disc do not have their own CD player at all.
At this point, I'd probably look like a serious face to the news broadcast while I'm looking at a bunch of quilts that kind of pious boss novas.
The new arrival of vinyl discs is also accompanied by a "pocal phenomenon", which is found by Jonny, a salesman of the Sounds of the Universe, who is now three middle-aged men.
"One customer recently came in and said he didn't have a disk player, but he wants to buy a radiohead so he can put it on his shelf", Jonny says.
"The share of these customers is not great, but they do.
To them, materialism is more important than music.
Some of our clients tell me they don't have a record player yet.
They're younger, no parents, mostly teenagers, who're just starting a hobby."
The customer is much more varied in Fopi, where I arrive next. The movement has dedicated a whole layer of vinyl plates.
There are 70-year-old couples, photos of tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The difference between customers will be happy, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: loudspeaks instead of swinging jazz, the new sex of Wild Beats is a rising synthesist pop.
None of the clients look so lonely, but it's hard to detect a calculating psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopia for a few minutes and looking at various discount discs.
He's more like watching shopping.
He says his income is small, so it's not possible for him to collect the records.
"They cost a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the coolness of the violin is...", he lets a lovely hiccup and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I can see a bunch of teenage girls who would think they'd jump out of jeans, but instead, gather around the Polaroid cameras, and I see a father and daughter who'd think about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a stairway filled with walls of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any middle collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they're just an interior element and part so high that they don't even get promoted.
They're a clean "art vinyl" act.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the search trip in Sohoo, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population, most likely to have more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl.
Although my research shows that youGov's results are true, at least in Soho's records, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans who actually exist in both record stores and web forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
At least they don't spend Thursday mornings at the record stores at Berwick Street, browsing records and avoiding a 30-year-old who stares scaredly and blinks at unsuspected middle-aged men.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest live spine – video report
According to researchers, the world’s longest living vertebrae is an ice shark.
According to the shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest icehouse ever came from study 272 to 512 years, which was a five-metre female of length.
The French court rejected the application for the landing of the goods in the jungle camp
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities calling for the landing of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants through the settlement of thousands of refugees in the jungle camp.
In this week's trial, the Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to break down 72 temporary shops for the refugee camp, which sell different goods for the refugee camp's residents from tobacco to energy drinks and offer hair clips, and the local restaurants can buy tea with 50 cents or basic meals by a few euros.
According to the authorities of Calais, these goods and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and they involve fire and hygiene.
The humanitarian aid groups told the Court that trades and restaurants are essential for the camp, as the free meals offered by the State-supported organisation and other entities are not sufficient for the ever-growing population of the camp.
They often call for protection and free food for those who need it.
The Lille Court decided that there was no legal basis for deporting 72 temporary traders, but held Calais' prefect's concern as "completely understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, camp grocery stores, cafés and restaurants are much more important than simply providing food to people who "live under extremely unstable conditions".
He says they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteer workers can meet each other.
One of the places under the threat of decomposition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids cafe, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice to the hundreds of the camp without guardian of minors with the most vulnerable status.
Over 170,000 people have signed an address where children's café is required to remain.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, it would be "a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp growth of the summer’s fires, the population of the jungle camp has risen to more than 9 000 persons.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than on average in the EU
In Finland, food is severely reduced to the satisfaction of consumers and the harm of producers.
In Finland, food prices have fallen by almost 5% in three years, with an average fall of 0.9% in EU countries.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has increased by 1%.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from those EU countries where there is a similar level of pay as in Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the article published in the Tieto & Trendit blog, Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of Statistics Finland’s development.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage of EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the translation, after which the food has become cheaper for a year.
Russia's food import bans are now under pressure, which have stifled food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Puntin's policy has helped Finnish consumers with a short perspective", says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition for industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The high trade chains S-group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not the types of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country with a wage level similar to Finland.
According to the press, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on value added tax.
He found that if analogue countries had the same rate of VAT, they would sell the cheapest food in Finland from countries similar to the same level of wages.
The magazine compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If VAT rates were seven in the analogue countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell better food than Finns would.
"If we want to reach EU levels at food prices in the old EU countries, we must halve VAT to the EU's average level and continue the price competition", Lehtinen writes.
The paper points out that the VAT rate he has calculated is indicative.
School's not exactly the same anymore.
Those returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the academic year in all secondary schools.
It is a guide for all schools in Finland to operate.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of beauty is given up, and schools instead begin to practice codem.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social learning is already being read in four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
In the past, it was considered that the teacher teaches students, but now everyone must be active and learn from one another.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest spine found an ice shark can live for up to 400 years.
To the ice-fish known as Greenlandian shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at 150 years of age.
It can live after 250 years, report a new investigation.
The figures make the species the longest backbone of today’s world.
In the animal population it is only passed by an Icelandic girl whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to age 507.
The Greenlandic sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Women stretch for longer, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Since the growth rate is slow, the congregations say that only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues found out.
He defined the age of the adults from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbonisation of eye lenses.
The average age of the shark studied was 272 years or more.
Two of the biggest fish in the sample, 493 and 502-cent Amazonians, were found at approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that the ice sharks reach sexual maturity only over 4 metres, researchers have calculated that they are approximately 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann is fired from almost 300, not the sellers.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company that made trouble ended at the beginning of August.
"The outcome of the negotiations is to reduce about 300 jobs, the majority of which will be carried out in the form of dismissals", says Stockmann.
It states that the number of sellers in the goods industry is not reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, around 80 workers in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
The Stockmann yt negotiations concerned around 3 000 workers.
At their start, the need for a reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction in the amount of this reduction is aimed at the annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to be achieved next year.
Stockmann has already launched a efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is the difficulty of making Stockmann profitable.
Although the adjusted operating result of the Group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, the trade in goods is still losing.
See Stockmann. According to Lauri Veijalainen, CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales premises have not met the company's objectives.
"The reduction of staff is unfortunately necessary in order to ensure a positive operating result on Stockmann Retail in 2018", Veijalainen states in the communication.
The result improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved his net sales and profit for the second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year’s Group’s net sales will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
On Friday, it's rainiest in the north, temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure center on the north side of Finland keeps the weather on a rainy Friday, tells the meteorologist Ilona Láng.
In the middle of the country too, rain cubes come, but the south is southward.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country remains below 20 degrees.
In northern rainy areas, 10-15 are left behind.
Kenya’s General Sports Team shakes out a special explanation for dopingsandal coach’s campaign
Kenian sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it became apparent that Anzrah was present in the national team as a athlete in doping test.
The News Office AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to appear is a 800 m star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team management, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina.
Doping officials came to the authorities in Anzra.
According to Soi, Anzhah was sent home because he "made a crime against Kenya's country team".
He was a athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the papers.
We cannot accept this use," Kip Keino, Chairman of the European Olympic Committee in Kenya, would, in turn, rock the news office for Reuters.
Olympics’ general sport begins on Friday, and Roth is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was placed last year in the World Championships on the way to the fourth level and has pre-empted Rio’s winning contributions.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya’s sports team claimed that Anzrah was passing the sportsman’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to officials because he was afraid he'd show up," the source told me.
Where is everybody?
Rio's sports stadium is dripping out
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least, they don't watch sports.
In Rio, a fight started on Friday on the medals of public sports, but the world’s top artists were able to present their skills to a confusing empty view.
Rio’s organiser said on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first morning tickets and 65 per cent of the evening tickets have been sold.
It was another four years ago in London, where the stadium pulsed for a cheery crowd.
The tickets to the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics’ loss of sight has attracted attention even before general sports.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the views of rugby, melon and horse riding.
When Brazil’s medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach balloons in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian twins, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 audiences were filled.
Bad behaviour is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, struggling in economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian competitions, and many Olympics are strange for Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even Brazil’s football team’s first match did not allow the football stadium to be drawn to its full.
On the weekend, editor Mario Andrada reported that 82 per cent of tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
"There is still 1.1 million left for sale," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
In London, 8,5 million tickets were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half more than in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the Summer Olympics in London, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, as organisers need money and try to get tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, though, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less well-known types of school in the country, such as golf and rugby.
The Rio Stadium had empty seats this morning.
Even beach balloons in the Copacabana sand have not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Centralsalo competed in London in 2012.
There's plenty of people in the papers.
New way of protecting nature - Get the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, set up last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
It will then be possible for private, business and communities to redeem rights to the land by money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The area is virtually divided into blocks that are willing to acquire rights against payment of the right of holder.
The administrator receives 187 square blocks of veto law, which in practice means that each holder does not need approval if the use of the land is to be changed.
It is also possible to acquire rights in several areas.
The acquisition of a right of control is something concrete that can be left with your heritage or given as a gift.
There is no need to go down to banderoles or chain themselves somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Leviäkanu, who acquired control of his company.
Those who have acquired the right to manage receive accurate location information from their block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
The names of the recipients of the rights of the holder are available on the website of the Foundation in the same map as the area's block data.
The only risk that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea is to protect its nature.
The Helsinki Foundation is a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting environmental and natural protection.
It is a risk that the Foundation would act in some form of an ethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is the protection of natural areas so that they can be inviolable and peaceful.
The Foundation will acquire land, either by buying or by making donations.
It is mainly financed by the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to obtain additional protection countries.
It is also aimed outside the borders of Finland and plans to land in Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities at the pop up forest at the Helsinki Shopping Hall on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves torture Turku from the great cities - look at the situation in your municipality
The bicycle thieves torture Turku, the largest cities in Finland.
This year, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, there has been more rounding than in nine other largest cities.
Based on reported wheelchair thefts by the Helsinki Times, the number of bicycles stolen in ten largest cities in January to August of this year and parts of them per thousand inhabitants was determined.
In addition to Turku, the top rose to Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti.
According to the police, four out of five wheelchairs per thousand inhabitants took place.
Instead, only about two wheels per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double thefts are carried out in proportion to the number of inhabitants compared to others," described Tommi Reen, police inspector at the police administration.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
"The extent to which things are common can be influenced by how much the city is moving around and how many wheels there are at the top of it", is considered by Sergeant Teemu Auteus.
According to Tommi Reen, the police administration is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and a lot of spins available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a different city in which urban centres are at a distance and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport", Reen says.
In January to August, there have been slightly fewer wheelchair thefts throughout Finland than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, there is no cause for great joy.
Despite recent years' decline, there will be a little more than 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 fillaries every day and only in Helsinki is about 4 000 wheels a year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, for only part of the victims report to the police in theft.
Reen calls on people to report crime on wheelchair theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to the police will survive.
A typical cleared wheelchair thief is one where the police receive information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"There are also other cases in the investigation when, for example, you can find stolen wheels in a drug case", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly by themselves or in connection with a police investigation, says older Officer Timo Leppämämämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen, for example, from the wheelchairs, interiors, warehouses and wheelchairs of commercial centres, i.e. practically everywhere they are stored.
One of the most individual bike models is stolen in the past years like Jopos.
The U-lock provides better protection for the wheel than for many other types of lock.
Some thieves take a bike, for example, for their short-term use, but much of the wheels stolen end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They're on the domestic market.
"At least it's never come to the police to know that stolen wheels would go nowhere," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
I'm sure part of it will buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the wheel used must be careful, as he may commit a covert crime or violation.
"The alarm clocks should be ringing if a good fit of wheels are sold in their clear areas," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, special library official, carries the colourful Nopsa for the favors of Kallio's library in Helsinki at all times during its working day.
He's had five pieces of bikes, but none of them's been stolen, Hirvi says, "No one's ever been taken, so there's been a good monk."
"Though this may not be so attractive to thieves, this may not necessarily be the hipster value", the Helsinki Hirvi wonders.
In the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siuri Valve quickly locked its bike with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike hit the wall, but the Watch usually locks its bike into something solid, like a wheelchair.
"There will be quite a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own", says the Helsinki student of his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time they hear from their friends they've taken rounds."
"Most bad wheels, such dirty-ass-ass."
A bike was stolen from the guard himself from the inside of the building company a year ago.
The wheel had been locked, though, so the Watch could wait to give it up.
Under 15 years of responsibility for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer flight crews familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, we are experimenting with a so-called peer-to-peer crew to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment is applicable to people under 15 who are now under criminal liability.
We don't have the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that a peer-to-peer will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and determine the penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator can join a peer-to-peer crew to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may be a letter written to the family, explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Executive Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not tight.
We also have other forms of conciliation that are used in parallel.
"All are guided in a more responsible direction by a young person, so that not everything will go wrong with the first mistake," says Laitio.
In the United States, a model has been taken for a peer-to-peer crew, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person will not face an adult panel but reflexe what happened to the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The service design agency Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio reports that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first offences of people under 15 have not necessarily been dealt with before.
"It's been a message to keep going on the road you've chosen," Lovio says.
The reference flight crew is part of the Helsinki project for immigrant young people, followed by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio points out that new ways of working are being offered to all those who need it, not just for immigrants.
More than 70 Republican actors want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
Politico, U.S.A., reported in the letter, received a draft from it.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money directed to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his lack of respect, incompetence and record dissatisfaction threaten to be brought to the Democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only the direct orientation of all possible funds in Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in Trump's decorative anchor's neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election will be reduced by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
These include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons organized by the letter is obviously the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who resists Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "humans who want a party to protect the majority in Congress" and that it is not anybody's support.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump, which are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous autoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families
In the United States, President-in-Office Hillary Clinton reported details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the US economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends", Clinton said in his speech.
Clinton’s plan focuses on a massive, $275 billion five-year programme to improve the U.S. infrastructure road, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a hand-holding for the American duunares, who suffer from the transfer of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in decent jobs after World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to construction!
Clinton told me.
Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, emphasising that rich people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be tax-free, it has to pay for the source tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"I am against all trade agreements that operate against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
According to speculations published before Clinton's speech, the Washington Post was going to judge the Republican Donald Trump's financial programme, which was released on Monday, that it "only favours millions like this".
Trump's proposal for a reduction in corporate tax has previously been called 'Trump Porsche'.
Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump manufactures himself in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America a big one again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton squealed.
These are Rio's viewers: The rails have not glued Finnish Roses, but the mobile app is interested
Usually sports competitions appear in TV viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympics in Rio have so far not achieved any number of viewers.
At the same time, competitions have glued to the top 12% of the population, with 615 000 viewers from Yle Olympic Channel on Tuesday evenings.
For the purposes of comparison: EM competitions of a month ago received almost 800 000 viewers at a time by TV2 and a well-known second million football EM competitions.
The Olympics have so far been interested in cycling on Sunday night and in opening the fifth day of competition, both of which reached the Olympic Channel almost half a million viewers at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Chief of Sports, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that the viewers will be divided into several different instruments for the first time in the Olympics in Rio.
In addition to TV, Finns will follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers at all choose the Olympic Games.
Even on TV, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympics in Rio are the first sports competition Yle has dedicated a whole channel to.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are always from 20,000 to 500 000, it's a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than in London 2012 or in Beijing 2008 but the difference in time is partly explained by the difference in time - much of Rio's competitions become in Finland during the nighttime.
Another reason for a loose interest - if it is now considered to be mild - is certainly a traditional Finnish cause: if Finland had taken from the initial competition some surprise medal, the interest would have pompsahed up with it.
In addition, sport is only about to start, as is the case with other Finnish interested species: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When general sports begins, the viewers will explode.
Yle launched a mobile application for the competitions Yle Rio 2016 which rose during the first days of the races at Apple App Store, Finland’s most downloadable free application.
By Monday, the application had been downloaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're already on 200,000 downloads.
"We can only get the Verkko viewers later", Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not been desirable for all users.
Pokkinen says there's been feedback and the bugs have been repaired.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by a delay and other small technical problems in the early stages.
An updated version of the applications has been obtained, which should correct errors.
The Olympics in Rio will appear on Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sports event ever.
The Yle Fem can follow some species, and on the radio Yle Phone communicates races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborers for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only follow from Yle's channels.
From 2018 the Olympic Games will be observed both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deep lake of Finland?
According to official statistics, the deep lake of Finland is your sun, which has a depth of 95,3 meters on Ristinselä.
It might be even deeper.
The techmilling instructor Matti Kannela found a weight of about 20 square meters from Crossisel, the bottom of which was shown to be a depth of 104 meters.
In summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre sought to confirm the observation by excavating.
The method may not be able to find a slight deepening of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95,3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvas water (90 meters).
Over 80 metres are Saimaa, Toisvesi and Lake Main.
They haven't been studied as closely as your sun.
Especially the bottom of the Inari Lake has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Lake Jukkajärvi, 23 meters.
So looking at your sun, you can't get into the top ten, and Suvasvesi is further away from the top.
August 12 at 14.29: Corrected last piece, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Ihalainen from the tax point of view: Pensioners' tax is still more stringent
Pensioners' tax is still tighter than employees.
The Ihalainen says that the gap came under Parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to equalise employees.
This is not included in the Government's presentation.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises that have been made should be followed after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income reductions which reduced taxation.
In the Parliament, the case was heated by the opposition representatives who were embroiled by the mandates of the Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbia (Kok).
The purchasing power is secured, it won't grow.
According to Ihalainen, the line presented by Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (Kok) is mainly about securing and increasing purchasing power, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax reductions will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
The Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (cent.) and Orpo, who are eager to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached.
He says that holding up this agreement is important for credibility.
It is the main economic and employment policy activity of the government.
It is done with the power of the social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It becomes necessary because the economy is so much in favour of domestic demand and people's own future.
Impairment of long-term unemployment
The Irish call on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of increasing the employment rate to 72% is to escape.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims at the attacks in Thailand
At least four people died in bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy calls on Finns in Finland to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
After all, it is not appropriate for Finnish tourists in Thailand to cancel their journey because of explosives, but it is advisable to follow the instructions of the embassy for caution, says Westphalen.
In Thailand very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai period of travel is scheduled for one year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has sought, in particular, the Finns in Hua Hini to find out about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts at Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, we don't have any information on the subject of the attacks yet.
The Ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political unrest of the Thai divided society and to the referendum last week by the military train.
The law was adopted by a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, in turn, there is an ethnic conflict with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local party in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city is celebrating the queen's birthday and her mother's day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks affect the day so that the authorities are very precise about safety.
Thailand Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, says Thailand Police News Office, according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as those popular by tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at night, reports Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, there were no deaths.
Two bombs exploded according to the magazine at the Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ngas, where according to the magazine one person was wounded.
According to the local authorities, a total of four bombs have been bombed in the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
In either of the double-bomb shots, at least one died.
In addition, in the village of Surat Than, South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in each city of Trang.
In both attacks, at least one person died.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, for it is carried to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday island.
Not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thai military train, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are a attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don't have to make people panic any more, he told the journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Secretary for Security, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in Finland to be careful and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
After all, it is not appropriate for Thai Finns to cancel their journey because of explosives, but it is worth taking care, says Westphalen.
In the affected Europeans
There is very little known about attacks during the Finnish night and their victims.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been a little more time to get information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian among those injured.
In the second attack of Hua Hin, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the clock tower known as the sighting.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated the Hua Hin area from which it believes it has found another bomb.
According to the governor of the county, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bench.
A municipal worker died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The police chief interviewed by CNN says that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded every about half an hour.
Bangkok Post says the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the Women's Boxing
The United States Alexandra Raisman was second point 60.098 and Russia Alija Mustafina's third score of 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for television fairs in Rio with perman, jump and boom.
The party has been holding women's gymnastics for a long time in recent years.
He has had eight individual world championships for the past three years.
He has won the four-balling and permanine championships three times in a row as well as in the last and second years of the boom.
At the U.S. team, Bales has reached the World Championship in two teams.
It's a little bit darker, but it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The person has no influence on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a children's play club in Thailand Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bomb attacks on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think that this will follow anything more amazing, evaluate Huovila, who worked in Asia for about 20 years.
A experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many Thai tried tragedy.
There's always something here.
At first there was a tsunami, then a bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these past tourists haven't escaped, I don't think this is it.
The Huovla company office is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
Huovla heard about the attack from his own employee.
At about nine o'clock, the employee called the office and said that it would be best not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the coastside and the main mine Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work this morning in the same way as usual.
They thought that roadblocks had been laid for the queen's birthday, says Huovila, and refers to Friday's holidays in Thailand.
The Pathon atmosphere was calm and the main cover movements were allowed to open at about 10 p.m. local time.
Many on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At about three days, Thailand’s time in the Patong had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila.
Later this car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholminti.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
Partio found two men fit for a sense mark hidden in a nearby hexagon.
Another man got caught right away.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage of a motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear move aside
On Friday, a high-value change of leadership took place in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-scientific. He was Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for separating Ivanov can be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from gathering too much power around him.
He adds that recycling of leadership is one of the ways of power.
This is a way to prevent people from levying independent power on themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been mutilated with other managers or mutilated.
Arms drop to Ivanoville
Ivanov, within the inside of the Putin, is moving to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
By means of a tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed to replace Vaino, told Russia Today.
The Kangaspuro says that, from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear shut-down.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian regime.
Furthermore, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnönniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin will change his neighborhood younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield as they retreated to Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape into the city of Jarabulus, so that we could not aim at them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were exported to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdite fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which was important to Fathers.
However, it is estimated that ten jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Revised news at 7:30 p.m.: In the past, we incorrectly told that civilians were about to flee the city, in fact, the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians while they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior document publication policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutist tells STT that the public can't be based on the Authority's own policies, but is based on law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to issue a list of participants to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by instructions from the Government's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Ministry's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Minister's Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
Like in recent years, Bolt has been running against time under precious races.
From the early season, he violated his back and had to skip the Jamaican Olympic Games.
This has not been perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included little samba dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt is surrounded by the fact that the Japanese star has risen in the age of time when sports has been struggling with doping scandalals and persevering interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he escaped in the early 200 meters of time 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and loose position of your training.
Four years later, his reign in Beijing began at a hundred meters, where he crushed the world record and the confidence of the competitors despite the final ceremony of 9,69.
It's harder than that.
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached his career at a point in law.
World records in Berlin are still valid at 9,58 hundreds of meters and 19,19 two centuries.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his pursuit of a 200-foot world record and a 19-second discount, but no one believes that it is born except Bolt himself.
In the rain, Bolt’s most challenging is Justin Gatlin, winner of the 2004 100th Olympic Games in Athens.
Last year in Beijing's MM-final Bolt defeated the American with only one hundredth century secondary.
Bolt has not been lost in the finals of prizes during his reign in Beijing for once if he has only been able to travel.
In Daegu 2011, the MM-final of 100 remained unrunned from Bolt because of the flash start.
Bolt will fill in a lot in a week after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The final finish line for the Ura, Bolt, has set the Next year World Championships in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Disputes from Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, the Chinese newspaper Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Olympics in Rio.
There were traces of prohibited substances found in the sample of the Chinese giant Chen Xiny.
Bulgarian beverages Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenian sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of eu-hormonic.
He was in Rio fourth in women's 100 meters of butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Etadao, the Chinese Supreme Court has brought its case of doping to the proceedings of the International Court of Appeal of Sport.
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have found evidence of hydrochlorothiazide diuretics.
Rio has also revealed other doping pills.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female drinkers Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of eu-hormon.
Kenya has, for its part, moved from Rio to the home of the sports coach because of the doping exercise.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenian coach had acted as a athlete in the test and had given a doping sample to this effect.
According to the media, it is the Kenian fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich’s race of 800 meters in a situation.
The Phelps aren't stopping at all... the historic gold came in the show-style.
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics, the United States of America Michael Phelps swim 200 meters in a mixture of 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps reached the first bathing area of the same species from the Olympic Games of the same species in the fourth consecutive races.
The winning time for the Phelps was 1.54.66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was mixed up in the second time before the Chinese Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have some fun, Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympic Compartmenter, laughs at the evening page for a quick interview.
The case from Helen Skkelton (a.k.a.) on Monday is one of the most popular websites of this week's evening magazine.
I'm visiting a commentator named Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not very stressed if there is a small noise in the sound or British press about his exposed and unusual costumes.
The TV's a visual media, he's pressing.
Skelton's dressed in high-rate shoes and short-sleeved dress, with at least sufficient exposedness, at least in the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there is no guarantee.
It's important to look good, and small things are just a funny thing.
Well, I'm sure Skelton wants to scare you and maybe bother you, but he'll stress that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I dress up.
Can you imagine that the womb has reached Finland?
I can't, but all that's paying attention to how hard these swimmers do their job and how big sacrifices they make is fine for me, Skelto's agitated.
You know what?
It'll be out of nowhere if it comes from dressing up (a runner).
I'm just a little curious if someone's been hit by one of them.
Rio's police did two arrests for terrorist possession.
On Thursday, Rio's police reported that it's arrested two people for counter-terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the security oversight of the races.
The police did five other arrests at the same time and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 News site, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as the police already arrested in July.
Arrested persons are believed to have contacts with the Isis Organisation.
The arresters had reportedly exposed violence in social media.
Messages that were called upon to violence had been distributed, among other things, in the recommended WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's races is equivalent to 85,000 police officers.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their Rio basketball tournament in an empty-gold game on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place out of the audience.
The police let the public in after they blew up the package in a controlled manner.
This was the third time in Rio's Olympics since the police have performed a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package.
The audience got in after the police had safely blew up the package.
The audience did not see it by the beginning of the match because the police closed the arena toll because of a suspicious package.
The police blew up the package and let the audience rule until after that.
The drink woke the races to a sleepy start for the Spanish team.
With two losses, Spain started with Nigeria score 96-87.
In the two previous races, Spain reached silver.
The police have already performed a controlled explosion mission for the third time during the Rio summer contest.
Last time, the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the site of road cycling last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty audiences.
Argentine's lady dressed up as the Petator-Siren - a Finnish woman thought about the protest
The wind of the Petjo-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind of Petjari-Siren was a tough one on Thursday.
Argentine lady dressed Tuuli Pettaja-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the day of women's surfing.
There was a clear breach of the wind.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He got stuck because of the accident, and others ran away; Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
A athlete had a long time to consider protest.
Then it was not worth doing because it would have been futile according to the Olympic rules.
I should've dropped in the water so I could get a refund," said Pettaja-Siren.
The Finnish hanged on the ferry until the last time, because she didn't want to go to Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish person left behind 27 with the car crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The accident didn't seem to have much effect.
It's a big day on Friday when we have to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Pettä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 specific issues which, according to science, increase age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years into the life of a person.
Some of the things are customs that affect person’s health directly or indirectly so that his life lasts longer.
Sometimes, on other occasions, things that a person himself cannot influence can bring to him extra years.
These include the tendency to moderately or to a social position.
Regular shopping may extend the age.
You don't even have to do that. All you have to do is get a milk can.
The secret of a long time has been sought by many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drink of fish and coffee
Coffee drinks have been shown to be protected from cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease.
Harvard University's research noted that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "lower risk of death", particularly as regards neurological or heart disease.
On behalf of the alcohol, once again there are studies that the use of justice - one of the three daily doses - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
The regular use of a toothpaste can extend the life of a person even for more than six years, one study tells.
The claim is that this prevents infection.
On the other hand, they can help the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in man’s body.
The survey in Norway revealed how laughing had affected man’s life.
The seven-year project observed more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the test.
Sex, when gender protection has been taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
To gain extra years of life, a person should also receive orgasm.
I mean, it's not like it's going to be a problem. It's not gonna be a problem.
However, achieving a long life does not require absolute solidarity.
One study of Oxford University found that women with a large rear side had lower cholesterol levels.
Their body also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study combined these aspects with lower mortality.
Whether it's a athlete or an actor who won Oscar at the Olympic medals, he's more likely to live longer than a regular bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings more years of his life.
Some researchers, for example, suspect that age is due to a person's social status, which, on its own, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the behaviour of people over 65 years of age found that a person who was shopping daily, or likely to become a parent who was less likely to make purchases.
This is due to the fact that circulation in specific shops reduces loneliness.
It has once again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
So count your credit card with your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
The owl-dicker's ride went down the truck.
On Friday night, a heavy truck and a passenger car were hit by Koske.
The accident occurred in Koske, between the Koskents and Sorvastont on Friday at 9 a.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the passenger car received was driving along the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck went up, but it started to burn.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car went down to the stream, and from there, over the fence to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 who transported a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University Hospital of Turku.
The result of the female breath test was 2.02 promina.
He's suspected of a gross DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket's bulk selection was incomplete because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
On Thursday, Teija Haltia, who lives in the estate, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit my eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
If not, then, in the lawn cut, the sign reads it.
The ticking sign of a merchant is linked to the fact that the Posti extended its last spring services to also grass chops.
The grass cut is offered by Post until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly fun and decided to share it with social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a snooze.
Even media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this issue is amazing, but Haltia is wondering.
On Friday night, Haltia updated over 700 sections on Facebook.
Haltia got her favorites caught in a breeches bag, even though a few camps were empty.
Postin Kaideso, responsible for the business of transportation services of companies, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were misled yesterday in the wrong place (the Wall River) and we no longer left to do part-time (Salon) at three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first thing that's been news of the evening-Sanoma.
Teija Halti didn't get sore about the sign, because she found all her own breeches in the selection.
Humidiness! 30 kilos of light Lotta Backlund published a picture of his change
The Finnish producer has taken care of 10 kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost ten pounds as a result of change in life.
On Friday, Lotta shared a photo pair of her changes on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta had a gym and meant normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Kooman, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss career already in 2009.
He's a total change in life and he's been down a little bit by thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund published his flute performance on film pair Instagram.
The picture shows how huge Lotta has changed her appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after the film couple has collected a number of praiseful comments from the shopkeepers.
You're great, aren't you?
At the same time we're on our way, motivation is hard!
Pia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project now.
I get the strength and the zeal of your images when I'm on the same journey, the other one tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the project now.
At that time, he told the evening magazine that he wanted to reach a normal weight of 10 kg at that time.
During the three-month gym, kilos fell eventually.
Wish of a woman's family who was murdered in a horse: The victims' memories of police dogs
A week ago, the 42-year-old woman's family in Lovisa hopes that the victim would be remembered by donation instead of flowers and addresses for police work.
Sipoo Animal Health Station has published an Facebook update which conveys the wish of the victim's family for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked at Sipo's veterinary centre as well as had done his nurse's training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls women's touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and job intimidating.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds go to police dogs in their entirety, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old lady was murdered in her own yard of Lovisa in Koskenkylä.
She's been told by neighbors that the victim was very poor at night.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, and a flower.
A man who was 27 years old suspected of murder didn't know a woman, and they had nothing to do with it.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog named Börje, who was life-threatening in the arrest.
But the stock market survived and is recovering.
The law passed a judgment on infringements of the equality law to Post.
The Post did not have the right to arrest the employee who refused access to the staff member's salary, according to Kanta-Häme's judgment.
The rights of workers were ordered by Post to pay the worker the majority of the paid salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the staffer’s salary, which accounted for the share of the practice throughout the day’s work.
According to the law of law, the worker was set up in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the equality law.
The worker had followed the decision of the Union in the field of Post and Logistics (PAU) on the prohibition of access.
In November last year's Post Act, the PAU decided that Post's employees would not be familiar with the infringement of temporary workers.
The case was first discussed by the National News.
Turkey's return to a road that respects human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and respect for human rights development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipil (cent.) and by Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree with the situation of human rights in Turkey.
In his letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipil and Sonia to express their concern for freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putin fired the chief of his administration to replace the Estonian Nano
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned Mr Sergei Ivanov, the Head of President's Administration, reports the Kremlin.
Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will be present.
A former diplomat, 44 years old, has worked as Vice-President of the President’s Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax news office.
Vladimir Putin fired his head of administration.
According to the Kreml's information, Ivanov, which belongs to the close inside of the Putin, is moving to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed to replace Vaino, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union during the KGB spying.
Many considered Ivanov as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President before Putin re-election in 2012.
BBC: Manu's giant purchase for a game ban - is not seen in the opening of the Valioliiga
A world record man for football transfers will not be seen in the field when the English Valioli is kicked out this weekend.
Paul Pogba's playout followed him to England.
The Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the website of ManU's opening its league against Bournemouthi on Sunday, told the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society of Pogba paid EUR 105 million.
However, the British football union FA keeps him out of the game, for Pogba was left under a ban on gambling.
He received two warnings at the Italian cup last season, and it will become one game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England. FA told BBC.
The next seam of Pogba to play is the league in the second round of August 19, when Manu meets Southampton.
The Flow's got a lot of great madness.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established the Flow Festival position as an internationally respected event, which is being stared by world-class artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festar miners have typically expressed themselves by dressing up in their own way.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stowed with artificial grass and art installations.
We have never been enough to have a main boat and a beer, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Helsinki Suvilahti this weekend has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind this success: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go?
It's pretty different in the inactions to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of 700,000 visitors in the past year by 5,000 persons.
Even this year, there are a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because things to do must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd that is directed on vast roads.
That's not what we want.
Throughout 13 years of success, ideologicalism has been pinned down with 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area covered by artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller platforms, this year, 15 000 people are in the tent.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented even more easily.
Maybe I'm a bit of a big deal, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done today is that even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operation was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of approximately EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can lead to "creisquest cases", such as the construction of that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves by dressing up in their own way.
In addition to the music event, it is possible to talk about the trendy adult community.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled into particular fashion.
We want to separate ourselves above all with content.
Still, fashion phenomena fit Flow's world of values: curiosity and the desire to change with the environment, says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have the most typical performers on a pop-music, rapper and soul-combined festival.
According to Kallio, Iggy was called up because now is probably the last time this is seen at the show in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's done some damn good jobs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist parade bombs were hidden in flower bags - tourists fled in their horrors
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded at the local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs had apparently been hidden in a flower bag and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreign customers.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists started to leave the bars and return to their hotels, told Officer Samoer Yoosumra, according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wild animal protector, lived in Asia, made a picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show properly, you can look at it from here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin had foreign tourists.
The people were running away from me and saying that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest baraways, told the Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonblad.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of injured persons is not known yet.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one knew he was dead.
At the same time, there was another double-bomb strike in Hua Hini.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin, which had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the action of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been involved in the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This is part of the new rescue troops leaving in a war situation first to fight
In an acute war situation, emergency personnel are only ordered for battle duties after several months of taking military oath, says Central Finland.
According to the Chief of Defence Training, General Jukka Sonninen, who is interviewed by Lehden, for example, in a military situation of 5.5 months in service, only those who are at the end of their education are capable of fighting.
According to the Head of Education, the service will first be provided by reserve staff.
No backup or reserve staff shall be assigned to a post which has not been assigned the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces will begin training the emergency personnel for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used for military activities already during emergency training.
Pamela Tola got the big payments from the home house.
The actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, Pauli Waroma, has won a serious dispute about the apartment they purchased from Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of a two-storey separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house, which led to a dangerous growth of microbibs for health.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a break-in in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court, and then they asked the seller for a discount.
The salesman contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the court and the court.
The court judgment was given on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the district court in which the seller was ordered to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344.
The right justified the price reduction a little, as some repair needs had already been made known to the purchasers when making the dwelling sale.
However, according to court law, the mistakes in construction were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a decent home
Tola told us in court that the couple had specifically sought good homes because they did not want to go to repairs.
He was born with an idea that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the rehabilitation report were not affected.
The fitness check report mentioned as risks and inconsistency in ventilation and the lack of adequate management of flooding and melting water.
However, the discussions did not show that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma remained aware that the rainwater from the rock might need to be guided a little within a few years.
Goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the dwelling were much more thought to be more serious.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed microbiculture in the building, which the Witnesses believe was due to both the rock rainfall and capillary soil contamination.
On the west side, the air contaminated by the microbials could, according to the inspector’s assessment, also access to indoor spaces through the cylinder.
Healthy risk, above the limit values, were found in a plastic sample of home care rooms, basement stairs, living room windows and basement washrooms.
Steels were built without permits
The law also challenged the fact that the apartment was enlarged against a building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision taken by the City of Espoo prior to the trade, according to which changes had been made to the housing permit.
For example, steels had been built, although there were no suitable permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
On the basis of the information received from the seller prior to the sale, the right of court was to assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for measuring repairs in the near future.
Tola and Warom had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The purchasers have not failed their obligation to report, and the court has ruled in its judgment.
The harsh archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to their children in the Nazi register - also Finnish
Editor Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article in Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives of Maryland in the United States contains documents on microfilms for a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women as well as 31 Swedish women wanted Nazimorsiam.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-Germany racial agency.
The racial agency was acting under the responsibility of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
None of the SS men in Nazi Germany were allowed to have children before they had been examined by a SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to bear more than 10 children.
Andersson said that gynaecological investigations were conducted in women to find out.
The racial agency examined women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Agency a hand-written lifeline, as well as good recommendations from close relatives.
The racial agency wanted guarantees that women were "children lovers", "sustainable", and "good national socialists" who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of the SS men.
The case does not mention how 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents were found.
The SS leaders created a state supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme provided for, among other things, that every SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside of it.
Lebensborn homes provide for children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not promoted very actively, the website of the American holocaust.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The honorist of the German mother was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "aryans" and "non-Aryans" were legally prohibited, found on the pages of the museum.
On the sixth floor, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed in third sailing at Finnjoll's first departures at the Olympic Games in Rio, but remained on the tails of the day at the second leaving.
Nirkko rose in total circumstances after the eighth five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
The wind of Pettaja-Siren fought for RS:X class day departures in 17 and three places.
In the overall situation, Petaja-Siren is sixth.
Jonah and Niklas Lindgren, 470, remained in place at the opening of the day 23.
In the overall situation, Lindgrans are in place 19.
Jari Sillanpään Satunna was recorded at night for a few hours: "I was so in a canoe"
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
The Sillanpea, who has been the best selling soloist in Finland, and who has been the star of dance boards and festivals in 1995, continues to embezzle and is currently in a pecky lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, told about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää describes his life and career as good as bad.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total rise in his victory on the Wallo River Tango market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang dances, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamä had written to Sillanpää, at the request of a man, a tango piece, which Kassu Halonen agreed in a slightly different form.
The saturna song became one of the most popular songs in the history of music in Finland.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpea sang it on a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so in the canoe!
The man's head is in the book.
You don't think that it's been sang in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically best, the trail was good.
I learned that all the time, I don't have to ask myself to be perfect and high.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of the man, mentioned in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner and the case finally ended with the texts of the gold piece that was published as single in 2014.
The book states that the songs ordered from Sarah Tõmä were not like Sillanpää would have liked.
His head had imagined himself making a record telling the truth about his own life, but the words of the separate song were not true, but written on the news of 7 days.
In the news of the magazine, the reason for the divorce between Jar and the ex-loved one was reported to be Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jar said it was a full butt, and it was not true.
According to the book, she called the record company in rage and refused to sing the song, but eventually she ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting out of the EU for their kingdom.
At the end of the day, 52% of the voters were in favour and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the poll polling of the voting week predicted the opposite result.
The British Economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in the EU's position.
No recognised research institute or university did sign up for a divorce, even though a few individual researchers were allowed to disagree with their profession’s power stream.
The theme "It's the economy, the stupends" of the former President of the United States in the Brexit vote in Britain.
The Economists were shocked when their voices didn't belong.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the main policy issue.
Economic Kiharaki
The Centre for Macroeconomics tiva in its latest monthly survey of professionalities answers to the Brexit disaster.
The answer is that the economists were not listened because this time voters decided on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of the economic loss of the economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the right British.
Many people also have the idea that the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist Committee, the voters did not believe the economic arguments because there was insufficient consensus between the Economists.
In particular, they were drawn by the BBC's equity, which provided as much space for only a couple of percent of economic scientists representing the EU's eco-economic community as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hostile press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE would think about the consequences of the difference.
These far-reaching combinations of letters spoke face to face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both heard and understood, they were not cared about because economists represent an elite with whom the voters, in their own view, do not share common interests.
The academics like the Economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigrantism is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, immigrants congeste your hospital, immigrants use you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In every waiting room at the health center, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical hours if they weren't there?
Every school has children, too, of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get to school if they got rid of them?
Foreigners live in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they went away?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists did not succeed and, if they did, they did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the British public finances and their consumption generate jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund made up for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by the Finnish Pertti Vanane.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory for the EU-wide camp, started to be prepared in greater detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a lie.
The problem was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
In normal terms, real estate funds do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Aberdeen's only open daily listings of the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15% and 20%.
At that time, the value of the fund was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is around £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanane of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest cash rate in these funds was 10% or even below it.
In other words, real estate funds made provision for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the deal
When the EU-wide camp won, Europe went nuts.
However, less than two weeks of voting on the real estate market were quite calm, says Vanane.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, real estate funds, the first, Standard Life, frozen their trade.
Together these robberyed the situation and brought the issue to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, says the Old One.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and after that, the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it had to be frozen for six days too.
According to old people, they did not actually close the deal, but they changed prices downwards.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it because it would cost you.
It calmed the situation, and most of it canceled the announcement.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says the Old One.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such damage in the Aberdeen Manner European funds.
But there was a lot of questions.
Inadequate attention to real estate funds
According to the old man, the closures of real estate funds were too much.
The open funds for closures account for about four per cent of British real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still stuck.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds to half of 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been cut down, but the situation does not seem "more" to Aberdeen.
The main issues now relate to the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, the Old One points out.
The price per pound and dollar is at its lowest for 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the period before the Brexit vote.
The dollar player can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, says the old man.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
Two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem so much.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanane, in charge of real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, came up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, and Vanane says in her second home in Helsinki.
He was headed right for work.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office supported the news, and people usually silently listened when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell us about his separation.
When the market opened, the screens flashed just red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live, Old One says.
Not because, despite myllerry, Aberdee, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate stores on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of peaceful, says the Old One.
The Brexit vote started the repair shop
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pun collapsed, the British leader broke up.
The market was expected to anticipate a sharp fall in the British real estate market, especially London.
Up to 20% of mines were anticipated in offices in London in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days, too.
Now the mulch has broken down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer vacation days this week on the face of the Old Age in Helsinki.
He thinks it's far too early to say a lot about what Brexit follows.
So much is still open: how the difference takes place and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been the first ever.
The CBRE data of the real estate service company on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, London's prices for all properties decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the negative was 6.1 per cent, read by the Old One.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only in five months there have been fewer figures, says the Old One.
All similar drop occurred in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared quite quickly with the global economic crisis that started on Lehman’s property market and the US real estate market.
In the old opinion, the parable is not very good, because it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another tunnel, too.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that, but is willing to sell to improve liquidity, says Old One.
You can also find the financial jacket in a normal way.
The repairs could have been in the front anyway.
As a matter of fact, he's not a miracle in the price correction business, which could have been in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of properties in London and other world cities in the first century have been too high.
We've been saying for two years that City, and in particular the offices, are overrated, Old One says.
So the fall began very high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has London's population.
Another big trend is that properties are the last category of ownership that globalises, Old One says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have become available, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target known as the city.
In addition, prices have fed low interest rates, which, for example, pension companies have had to look for revenue from new destinations.
There has been an easy access to this loan - although the debt gap has been used by Old Man now clearly less than during the boom preceding the crisis in 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price rises were set up last summer, says Old One.
Aberdeen too began to reduce his holdings in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of translation that was expected, and now it came.
What's it gonna be?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the Old One.
There's a lot he's afraid he'll be willing to assess, but he's saying that I don't think there's anything uplifting going on.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a descending or smooth going ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down because he has been in the real estate since 1988.
And he's still optimistic, and he thinks the holes are going to work.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're better off.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in a single market, there's too much of a victim.
If you've broken up, the risks are also decentralized, says the old man.
The S-group will start to register shopping details more precisely
The S-group knows what you eat, because today the Group of Commerce has told us that it will start gathering more accurate information about their customers' purchases.
As information has so far been collected from the final amount of the receipt, the group will start to miss the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-group comes after Kesko here, because the information on the goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riital, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has mainly been positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and is used for marketing purposes on an authorised basis.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
Time and time the customer has denied the use of product information, Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S-group registration change.
Kesko already classifys its client according to the mere purchases of meals into ten groups.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
The data are used for the marketing targeted to the customer.
Product-specific shopping information is collected only from the K-group's own chains.
The partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer program and does not have one of these plans.
In the immediate trade in Finland, Finland has its own Onesbonus customer program, which can be associated with in Valienta, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group-level data, we will remain at the balance level of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made in the store, and on the day and the final amount of the client's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level of K-group or S-group, says commercial manager Anu Ora.
In the future, he said that it would be a good idea to reform the customer's programme, but the Middle East will be later discussed.
However, Ora does not allow the registration of product information.
Initial trial
To date, SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively large.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information includes occupation, education, housing and the birth years of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase of S-Date cards has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, place, balance of purchases and method of payment.
In addition, data from S-bonus partners have been obtained from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level shopping data will be recorded in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have had a longer chance to focus more on marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of customer owner and partner activities of SOK.
The S-group says they'll be informed about the change they've made to their customers.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in cats, whether it was wanted or not.
You can check your stored data on the S-group website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila pup is Customs's latest dog confirmation - the penny becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador’s puppy is entrenched at the Helsinki Airport with the same five boxes placed in the same land.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
The Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
In the box next to Heila was sitting next to it, there was a jar of scented seals that smelled like grid gas.
Ruuti gas is the first smell that Heila and has now been trained, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online trade
Heila is the first specialised dog in the search for weapons and explosives in Customs and is placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
Work may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossings and ports as well.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
Following the attacks in Paris and Brussels, measures have been strengthened in Customs and controls have been confirmed, says chief inspector Mikko Grönberg of Customs.
The second is access to training for weapons and explosives dogs Customs' duties are mailing through Helsinki Airport.
With an increasing internet trade, up to 40 million mail is sent annually through the airport, including arms and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, Customs has made purchases of Internet commerce, baggage of passenger machinery and cargo of approximately 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source materials.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be looking into recorded baggage and mail.
In ports there will be great benefits in future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on his performance, Customs estimates whether more weapons and explosives will be trained in the future.
Grönberg looks forward to thinking.
School at the church
Heila puppy education is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonum.
Suntio also visits Heila to train with police and defense experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and in the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs and money and drug dogs in Customs, Massi.
Labrador extractor Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog that is to be selected for the airport include a rip-off and hunting spell, as well as calmness because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the Suntion home, is a close friend of work for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing gets home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from the disposable box.
The night cameraman loses the camera’s mic shield for a quick dog, but Heila returns the soft toy immediately from the "irti" command.
Hard competition from working dogs
The initial training of Heila will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, which assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can see work at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, passengers can't come to smooth the working vests on the dog, reminds us of Suntio.
The costs of one working dog are around EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they will retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active participations can only last from 10 minutes to two hours.
Work dogs are owned by hard competition in Customs.
Heila's owner sought about 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntion, who has never had a work dog before, but has years of experience in dogs as well as in supervisory duties in Customs.
The Mini State got its first Olympic medal - the people get their day off

Drama in Rio - a Finnishman fainted after the performance of the wild
The printing team Milko Tokola succeeded in his last venture after a hard battle of 175 kilos.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has several times passed out.
No one really could say why.
Tokola got 175 pounds of work and 145 kg of press work in Rio.
He had a total impact of 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get her job in the last five hundred and fifty-five pounds, as well.
By the third attempt, the weights rose in a fear of screaming.
The box was scratched by weight until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish overseer was afraid of the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has been acquired by Estonian hunter Prosan - Veiksikaliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ballo Society in the football league of men has made a lasting agreement with the Estonian-smoker Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We're looking for our team's top tracker with power and a threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
More than ten players and I went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
The release of the small silence began as a good alternative to Prosa, Coach Juha Malinen, who was coached by RoPS.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, taller than Flora, where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Wall River, where the Rovaniemen meet the ruling Finnish master SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, the rural king of last season, moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family Star is once again matching: Teen Star shorts reveal almost everything
A modern Family comedy, dear Alex Dunphyna, has become familiar with Ariel Winter again by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week at mini-hors, who won't leave much for imagination.
Shorts exposed not only the actors' legs but the back of this.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and use much more courageous.
The star has been poking in his social media images in very little clothes and taking numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to dress in very tight costumes.
The Winter at the hands of eternity has recently published several images of itself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image of publicity so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was in the process of "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
He's been on TV for almost his entire life and grew up in the age of the Cardashians.
He has learned that the more he shows the surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen with countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family Series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has pissed off part of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he is in ten years' time, when the sublime is already about hard, states a woman on Winter Instagram.
On the other hand, some of the women's fans defend the actor and call on him not to care for criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what everyone else says.
You're inspiration for a lot of women. You're exhilarating a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordics to Finland - tourists are attracted to the revon fire: In autumn it is possible to see a random monster aurora.
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the renunciation journeys from the beginning, according to Visit Finland.
Inari and Levi are the main destination of the Japanese renunciation.
Reton lights are the art cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly connected to the heart winter and lush landscapes.
In the winters of Lapland there is a great deal of demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
Few people know that the retreat season begins early in the autumn and continues far to spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see so-called monster aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revue lights making a vision of two times random, reports Visit Finland see. marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland's main destination group is wealthy 25-35, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and University of Turku and Tokyo researchers, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese needed clearer unique sights from Finland, and according to Lind, there is huge potential here.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown more than others in the Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double their nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to be satisfied with a silver rugby-7 contest when Fidz's master team won gold.
The UK’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby competitions was shattered when Fidzi won it on Thursday at the final played at Rio Deodoro Stadium 43-7.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball handling, transfer, side interviews, support, running and rough force and thus won gold – if there was a first Olympic medal in all its history.
The killing meant silver, which was a little more generous for Britain, because it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They could be proud of their success in the Rugby-7 tournament, which was the first time in the Olympic Games, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A strong victory from South African Boxes in numbers 7-5 on the same day may have had a negative impact on the team in finals.
Despite this, the Fidz team, in this form, would have won the British, even if the 15th-person team had been in full power.
The United Kingdom may find it comforting to have at least one British neck on the gold medal tomorrow: Ben Ryan, Fidz's chief coach, Ben Ryan, former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
It hurts, but progress is alarming.
Fidzi was excellent in setting out his labels for the UK as a result of interest.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had run into mobile buses, and world champions were 5-0 in command when Osea Kolinisau made the run.
When there were four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal in the right hand from the goal - to the right.
The situation between 12 and 0 and the United Kingdom had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent tactics prevented Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it didn't slow Fidz down for long.
When the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made a goal in the right corner, followed by a loss of 17-0 in Britain.
Nakarawa made another goal for furthering, with more than one minute left to play for the first half of the game time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed into the British team through the more powerless coats and crashed over the goalline.
After the paint kickoff, the opening period ended between 29 and 0.
It seemed that the Fidzians were born to play seven players in rugby, while the British are still in the role of the apprentice.
Which is largely true.
During the half-time, the United Kingdom made large-scale changes and managed to arrest the Fidzians for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team role of the Fidzians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down to 36-7 by making Britain the left corner of the goal, but the game had long since been lost to islanders in the South Sea, whose fans were singing in the audience, fading flags and dancing.
It was difficult not to admire the pure joyous attitude of Fidz.
Mata Viliame finished the visit to the Fidzian cake by making the goal at the last few moments.
The pill rings, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fidzi had won Japan's semi-final number 20-5 and the United Kingdom had moved past South Africa in a tight semi-final where the balance would solve the British goal.
Kyle Brown took South African Boxes in charge in the first half of the year, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goal poles in the second half of the season.
Marcus Watson, a brother of the English 15 players rugby team, Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's battle against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This more emotional could not be gold in these races.
Of the first bet the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning went away with 220 winning bets in history and found an additional golden moment in Estacio da Lago.
Even though they were two in the air, the third coach, Robin Williams, in the boat, heard a voice that encouraged them to take over their second consecutive Olympic cult in the women's twins, making them the first women in the history of British sports, who have reached the same conclusion.
Their superiority was undisputed, and their victory was already 39th consecutive and once more high.
What we see, two great athletes attaching water to the surface as swans of age, does not fully reflect the nature of success.
There are a great number of helpful hands behind each row, each of which has contributed to two points of achievement. However, the most important of the assistants is a coach who was diagnosed 30 months ago with cancer, who did not know if he would see today.
According to Williams, the situation at that time was tight.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
and it would've been pretty bad.
It's a little change of mind."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky that Williams was able to start treatment outside the season period of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused the least damage if, in such circumstances, it can even be said.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
The war itself is a long way away, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after victory, the two thoughts were at Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in trying to overcome his unrest.
Captain Stanning of the Royal British Police Army, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "I have been ruins this week, which may be a little extreme, but that means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years at Helen's and Robin's have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thanking him insanely great, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person with whom to train or better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The twins have found an overwhelming rhythm, to which their competitors have failed to draw blood.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very attached in a moment.
Helen's been playing "Keep up, stay with me."
It's very important not to drive off the road."
"We were happy to leave well, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything wonderful.
We didn't want the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good war and win the race we did."
The twins will think about a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will be celebrating her wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with the TV nature programs.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would've brought too much pressure."
"After the accident, it took me about six months to realize I was a Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to understand.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland replaces the government that has been robbed by the Panama leaks
In October Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections, which are already called for by protesters who have been furious with Panama's data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panamanian papers revealed a number of tax havens that have been circumvented by Irish politicians.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold a new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the latest rage of the people will affect the election result of the autumn.
In June, criticism of the rulings was clearly evident in the presidential elections, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected president from outside the policy area, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
United States Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled his latest speeches.
He said he was being sarcastic, claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate for the establishment of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was mad at what it said and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink down about your own Clinton receipt.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a bourbon-sucking dress with swimming beaches, including the British newspaper Guardian.
Mayor David Lisnard's decision states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a good way and a self-respective swimsuit.
The decision also states that swimming costumes, which greatly express religious links, can increase the risk of order disturbance in France, which has been targeted by terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men associated with Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the swimming water in the Oulu Region passed through the seul - the blue seams in the lake of Pykösköstö
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue seams have been observed on the riverside of Põykösärv.
During Tuesday and the middle week, the environmental action in the Oulu Region took samples of water from nine EU and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and gastropod enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were lower than the operating limits given in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal coke in the sea basin were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The water is not yet undisturbed, but in favourable circumstances the situation may quickly change with the presence of blue-green slabs on the surface of the water.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through enhanced inspections.
In case of changes in zinc exposure, this shall also be reported separately on the bathing track notification table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples from here.
MKT's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: more than 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest supply is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a reduction in taxes on the basis of the gift tax on the exchange of generation of forest space.
In the presentation by the Ministry of Finance, the reduction in forest supply has four objectives: promoting generation exchange of forest farms, increasing the age structure of forest owners, increasing forest size and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the net capital income of forestry.
Above all, the idea of a tool such as to promote generation exchange of forest farms is good, commented on the Central Association of Agriculture and Forestry Producers (MTK) Director Juha Hajarainen.
However, it is likely that there will be criticism of the tax change.
The reduction in forest presents a task of pure income on forest owners' capital.
It is a return on capital that has been reduced by all other reductions.
According to MKT and Haksrainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be higher if a reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The VM's proposal leaves behind by reducing the net income on forestry to prevent the loss of forest income which should be reduced by other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from tax even if there were no trees.
The model of calculation is too complex.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model applies only to small parts of forest owners.
The limit on the tax reduction linked to the forest yield is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's drawn too high for Hakkarais to think it's too high.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were excluded from the reduction line.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the objective of increasing the holding.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been carried out according to Hakkarainen for decades.
Its background is the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MKT, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful sleigh surprised the carmen at Himanga, two cars smuggled into the stream and ran into each other.
The fish river Himanga experienced a special chase on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two consecutive times the car went down into the stream, after which it came into contact with the driver.
According to Harri, the sun mate's fireman, the river's narrowing is suspected to be a powerful raid.
There were two people in the back of the car who were both transported to the hospital.
There's nothing more specific about their injuries.
The driver didn't get hurt.
The accident occurred on highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from Turku University researchers can help develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
Professor of Academy Johanna Ivaska's research team shows that the hardness of cancer increases the level of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells, as usual, grow in this environment.
According to Ivaska, growth of cancer was prevented in laboratory conditions by returning the surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer therapy may be improved by focusing on cancer cells as well as interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study have been published in the Nature Communications published on 4 August in the field of cell biology.
The suit of family death in Muhos continues in court, the prosecution demands a murder sentence for another person.
The ticking of the family death of the muhos continues in court for both of those sentenced to death.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home death in Muhoks.
For eight years, the second one received four months of killing and gross robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also sentenced to a serious threat to road safety as a young person and to the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The prosecution, the lawyers and the man who received the tougher sentence complained about the trial.
The prosecution requires a less guilty man to be sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for murder as a young person.
At the time of the act, they were fully understood
According to law, 17 - year - olds killed a man who worked as director of a school home for child welfare services last July.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the director who was sitting behind the living room couch, according to the grounds of the judgment.
The director had got rid of the sample and tolerated a young person to his room, when another young man hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten, and kicked into the head, among other things.
According to a mental study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from home at least since the day before.
The ice shark is the world's longest vertebrae, only growing at 156 years old
The world's longest live vertebrae is an frozen shark, reports the research published in the Science paper.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, the vault can live up to 400 years old.
The female is only growing when she's 156.
The fact that it only grows a centimetre a year adds to the life span of the ice shark.
Only one species is known for longer than living ice sharks.
The investigators found their age by radio carbon drive.
Due to the 1950s nuclear tests, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
For the oldest time, 392 years were estimated, though a throw in the direction or one can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Visa - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all tax revenue from the State would not be received if Donald Trump’s change in corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular as a result of the most profitable tax relief.
Trump described it as a revolution in his tax programme on Monday at Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
If we didn't collect it, we'd have a huge sum of $1,000 a year.
The upper income tax rate is now 39,6 after the reduction presented by Trump 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax completely.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation of business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The end-of-life environmental standards must be renewed and the energy regulation must be broken down.
The reform of Barack Obama's health care needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed as "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to the Trump, "above" trade policy is one of the major causes of the problems of the United States.
Free trade agreements would be shut down.
Imports from China were subject to a 45% penalty tax and 35% penalty tax from Mexico.
We'll offer you a new future.
America's event, not globalism, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the oceans, American steel will lift new skylighters all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully read the speech written by assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see the Trump program taking the US into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released his own program early on Friday in Finland time.
Attacks from the past - People's News
The sea is devastatingly mingling, but the actual wave of attack is hitting the middle of Madrid's street - the accounting with the past can begin.
It summed up the essence of the story of Pedro Almodovar's novelty.
The previous guidance work of Almodovar Travelers (2013) was a little fun and a rhino satirical comedy, before which I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish career.
Juliet (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a consistent, systematic love, human relationship and family drama with mother and daughter in the centre.
It's a simple story and it's a long way back.
Life seems to be modelled on the middle age titler (Emma Suarez), but then everything is threatened to fail.
In the later years of the random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of the Takaum and a long letter, Juliet once became her adult daughter.
He begins from the time before his daughter was born, the moment when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta will rise to the second part as a young teacher Adraina Ugarte, a TV familiar series between Ommeltte (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been handled in a way that she can think of as a cough, but I would say that time is sane and literally disposable.
For Almodóvar movies there is often a fair distance to such a characteristic shimmering.
It is a flatly exhibited, calmed, place in places with good music and a rather sad film with such ingredients for entertainment.
Instead, the Spanish director has a typical visual colouring effect and begins to put little quiet in his eye in a more pure shape than acting as a dramatic effect.
Diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains as high.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a nominee, you will change from scene to scene, and the same will apply to visible ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main issue, i.e. the viruses of the scene, is not more specific.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is external and little spiritual.
Almodóvar has produced a manuscript of literature in Nobel 2013 on the basis of three novels of Canadian Alice Munro.
Novellit has been published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat flat-rate written literature filming.
The substances would have been emotionally more intense than any drama, that much of the big things - especially the grueling guilt - about the topic of the movie.
Director and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Main sections: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film's first night at 12.8.
The government is trying to make an election - People's News
No new cuts are made, and the ministers are saying so that the basic Finns do not fall apart completely.
In the spring, however, the cut-offs are made.
No new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (cent.) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (Kok.) are under the budget line.
That is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's presentation, as social security cuts have already been decided in the spring framework.
Children's pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits associated with the National Pension Index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training operations continue.
The gymnasties haunt
Why are ministers so eager to stress that no further cuts are made on these?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipals will be held in April and will be the main heat meter in the parliamentary term, not the gallups.
It has previously been seen that the municipal result that takes the various sides of the government will ruin the government's atmosphere for a long time.
Gallupits, however, say that the government party's basic Finns are waiting for a rarity kill, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new delegates, many of them will be realised next spring at the cost of influence in the right-wing government.
The thread of life of the three political parties is about as large as that of the basic Finns.
It has not endured now, but more than half of those who voted for the vote had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs have also come to the surface of the Party's Parliamentary Group's visit.
First of all, no new cuts will come from the rhetoric, but the fact that next year they will be made fiercely and secondly, will be tried to soften the waiting attack on the basic Finns.
Major surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different... if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set a target for debt-responsibility in this parliamentary term, but next year, the Petter Orpo budget proposal will owe EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the gymnasties, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own agenda: indebtedness does not bend or even slow down.
One of them is to stick to the program.
This means new, even harder cuts on the former in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be based on a close balance during 2018 and then, in the spring, will be adopted in the Parliamentary elections as to what will happen.
The debt of these measures does not differ.
It is quite clear that indebtedness in today’s activities does not prevail, even though Juha Sipilä how to try a mild positive atmosphere.
Martti Hetemäen, State Secretary, at an information conference in Hetemäe's budget, is unanswered by the curves presented:
World economy growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. no aid for the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now cost three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
With government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, reported weekly government debt will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt relief proposed by the left-wing industry was rejected as it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs approximately EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by a whole new debt.
This is the central concept of assembly and basic Finnish perception of what is responsible.
Question: There is much to be done for the municipalities
Three out of four feel that the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise of children is the responsibility of the municipality, as illustrated by the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also assume responsibility for individual municipalities for libraries, culture, citizenship, building control, high school education and waste management.
The municipality's responsibility is sought more clearly by the county plan, specialist health care, vocational training, higher education institutions and institutional care for the disabled.
None of the municipalities' duties under the order of order is to be transferred to the State.
The underage cyclist ran after the race and ran away from the police.
The 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu ran away from the police party on the Ilomantsinti on Friday night at half the time.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorbike without light, but the young man left to drive the police running from a fair speed.
The rear drive went on to the Sonkajarannant, from which to Sorronahotie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the way.
Even after this, a young man ran away, but a faster - leg police caught the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0,75 promina.
He also did not have a driving licence, which would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
This case will be investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell in the stream
The truck in the rock cargo crashed in the river on the Polvijärve on Kavinti Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had driven to the left in a curve out of the way and fell on its side of the river.
The rescue facility brought the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above the door, along with the rescue cell helicopter personnel and first nurses.
The lifting of the vehicle was left to the owner of the car.
The fallen truck poured hydraulic oil into the road, which was absorbed by the rescue facility.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in the Air River.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtikylä, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres long, tall, and handsome, with white hair under the jaw.
Findings and clues of lost movements are requested to call Põhjamaa State Centre's tip number 02954400513.
The ingredients of the big accident in the air - look at the gallery of Parafest's destruction
The impact flow of parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
The President of the Joensuu Parafestivistry, Arto Puppuri, estimates that the festival can be made economically and can also be organised next year.
The final performers of the Parafeste Kalle Salonen appeared on the market at the end of the Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the presentations held at the city theatre premises beginning at 13 a.m.
The Art Center at Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is planned to be held.
The flow rate is generated in a thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
The changes in the shape of the cloud water bind heat, so the descending air cools and its pace towards the earth rises.
The Institute of Air Science reports that there are multiple leaks in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route to access currents.
The sinking flow hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum at Parafest's location on Friday afternoon before the fifth.
Three tents fell off, about 200 people were in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly injured.
There was one child in the group who was transported with a slight injury to further treatment.
Air pollution ageing in London
Research has shown that the skin of the Londoners is getting older faster than usual.
The reason for skin ageing is air pollution.
The British research is about Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Cac analyses London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired people in London is two and a half years older than an elderly person living in rural areas.
The skin-deprived small particles are a very fine dust pollution, which is the source of transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, are almost 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who are walking on their business trip in the vicinity of congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example by various masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended for a more practical solution.
The tractor brakes betrayed the man standing in front of your ass.
The man had moved rocks in his yard by a tractor.
When he had risen from the tractor and went to see it, the brakes on the tractor were deceived, and the tractor passed on to the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to find a man who was seriously injured in the further investigations at the Central Hospital.
The tractor didn't get any further than that, because it ran into stones in front of him.
Riento with the latest strength for the coming season
The League-Riento, who is playing in the Airball Championship, leaves a series of better starting points in October than a man's memory.
The team's been together for three weeks already.
The joint song is found in certainty better than in previous years, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
As the head coach of the conflict, Jani Säisa continues to congratulate the new team on their attempts and unity.
In the foreign triangle, the middle storm Fred Muson begins his second term in Rietus.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who was in Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent hacker.
Garchet is a passari, a Brazilian has 198 cents.
Through the Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost in all the salibandy World Competitions since 2003.
Now the sixth race is going in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North America's Cars.
I was in Turku working and playing with women in this country when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a salibandy country team.
I'm interested, and here we are, Jumpmanen, 48, says.
The band was born in 1967 near New York in Elizabeth’s city.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen graduated from the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species was not yet played at the SM level as salibdy did.
They played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later I played hockey in Jokipoj on the marker series, Jumppane remembers.
During the year 1991-92, the jury played the salibandy’s SM series with the university, and the following three went to Josba.
When he played, he trained the company's A girls to the championship.
The women's SM series went up in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumpernen played through the 10 women's marker series, with a balance of 169 matches of 51+34=85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
The son of a bitch, Puska and Tatu Väänäen, was named on the national team.
The Josban of Joensuun Salibandy Society was raised by Perttu Puska and the Enolainen-based Tatu Vänänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team playing in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Ere, Helsinki, Pertu Puska, a 25-year-old, attacking Ere, has played this before six men's land fights, where he has gathered a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defenseman of Wiler-Ersigen, Switzerland, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the travel trail and is part of the standard equipment of the national team with 117 ground fights.
The national team was also named the Pancari player Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt at the MMs last December.
The head coach of the Salibandymaa team is Petri Kettune, a Contiolahtilainen.
Beach Volley Artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
Esti Hasu is about to end the beach volley player at least after a temporary season.
Beach volley Finnish Championships will be resolved during the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days medals are played in series for both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola, six of the best couples in each series will be eligible for the SM-final tournament.
The local color of the tournament represents Elimäe NMKY raised by Essi Hasu, who has belonged to Finnish beach volley for several years.
The Hasu, now living in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to see you this weekend.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for the nested stadium.
I haven't played very often in the series of adults in Kouvola, so it's great to play at the finals in the home corners, Hasu sensed.
The Kouvola region lit Hasu’s spark into sports and gave good meals to a fine hobby.
There are very memories of a child.
I started the volleyball when I was nine at Elimäe's NMKY's E-girls.
The top is too big toy shirts in mind, knee protections on the ankles, as well as huge chutes and coreographs after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small area, the sports club was a community where everyone knew each other.
The group's collective spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved... with the father of the teammate coaching us, and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasule beach volley was already a natural selection of species during the junior season as the counterweight of the indoor balloon.
There's been a bit of a song on the navigator's beach since the 1990s.
It's always been active.
I also went to follow the SM tour, thinking that someday I'd be there.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays with the pajamasman Anniina Parkkinen in the SM Financials.
After the tournament in Rikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second heavy twin is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still missing SM gold in the prize cabinet, but Hasu throws a mystery.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasu's familiar audiences.
At the beginning of September, new challenges will be expected in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, but Hasu is planning.
In the event of disabled people in Joensuu, the major accident was close.
The sink current poured three tents at the Parafest Festival of disabled people in Joensuu.

Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 17 a.m.
A friend interviewed by the Karelian, fireman Markus Viitaniemi, tells the newspaper that the situation had ingredients for a major accident.
According to the paper, the next event is at stake.

Solomon’s Koli went out to be a brave farmer.
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Solomon’s Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
The Koli began shortly two years ago, together with her little brother, Valtteri Kol, as a successor to their home space.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural operator meant indebtedness and an increase in order to allow bread to come in hand from agriculture.
It's been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy with the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think it has to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a yardwreck, and at first the bank was not excited.
However, I went to the project myself, and I have been fully involved, and Solomon’s Koli tells and adds that he would not have done it if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out well.
Solomon’s Kol’s goal is to invest even bigger cattle.
The work has produced results because Solomon’s Koli has been elected to the ten best groups in the competition for a young farmer of the Earth’s Future.
He's competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the website until 21.8.
Bulgaria will report inflation for the first time for eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.

The annual average annual inflation rate measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (retirement from July 2015 to July 2016) was –0.8 % for the preceding 12 months (retirement to July 2015).
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation at 1.0%.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (from July 2016 to December 2015) has been –0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0.2%.

Prices decreased in clothes and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and in health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Sanchat anime effect is criticised as Asian caricature
Snachat says it was an anime inspired by this filter, but some observers believe it to be racist.
With the Snachat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an anax, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The birds are beautiful, distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced self-files per day.
All illusions quickly come to the public.
Snapchat lenses have been a part of the review of where it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty edge.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into voodles, twistedly teeth, and made cheek bubbles, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts would indicate a greater problem that the company has with differences.
The news and rage spread throughout Wednesday and among other things the newsletters The Verge and the Motherboard day after they removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant for honor to anime characters, not to be a caricature of Asian people.
But observers who have experienced racism were reminded of offensive stereotypes.
Some were good at an anime comparison.
In his e-mail, Grace Sparapani, an American student from Korea, who was widely distributed from the pictures, said that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to challenge the very tasteless Asian caricature to parallel the filter to the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not just "yellowface" but that it was taken to despicable extremes."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment that we carry along with them.
The general audience of Snachat consists of young people who are more diverse than their parents’ answers in their ethnic background. This may mean that they are likely to expect more sensibility.
"When one of the Snachat lenses creates a picture that insults the user, things like this no longer easily miss the attention, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who worked as the Product Manager and designer at the Medium Publicity Platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snachat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and telephone interview, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in the Snachati recruitment practices.
Zhu criticised the company for the majority of the white and exclusively male leaders and decided to write with his hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either so that there are no colored people in their unilateral staff that they can make such decisions, or that they also have colourful employees, but their position is not that they dare to express their views directly and easily" says Zhu, a Chinese American.
The other observers agree with him, but Snachat has largely failed to reply to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, relying on its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snachat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but according to his informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and the promotion of inclusion within the company.
Zhu says in his own role that he keeps his Snachat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to Congress's expert group, military officials have distorted his intelligence on Daddy.
On Thursday, the Congress's expert group published a report that officials on the U.S. armed forces, Central Command, changed intelligence campaigns in such a way that they would provide a more optimistic picture of the war against Jesse in Iraq and Syria than what events on the ground gave cause for understanding.
According to the analysts of the Committee of the United States of America (House Armed Services Committee), the Republican Presidents of the Sub-Committee responsible for defence appropriations set up a task force which reports the 'general dissatisfaction' of armed intelligence analysts.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is a US military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence reports approved by the Supreme Directors of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism than the facts shown on the field and were exceptionally more positive than the analysis of other units in the intelligence community", reports the press release on the report.
“Centcom’s events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when false analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers,” says California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"The mistakes of Centcom's management core go to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report gives details of the continuing problems in 2014 and 2015, which the Central Commandi's descriptions and analyses of American activities to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obaman administrative authorities have been forged, it provides an analytical picture of the threat posed by the Centcom leaders.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and statements to Congress were significantly more positive than the events were in reality", says the report.
"For example, the Centcom official gave a public statement that a major military attack on Mosu could take place in April or May 2015. "
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
"After months of research this is very clear," says the Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top-ranking intelligence leaders in the United States are manipulating the received intelligence to reduce Isis's threat to Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after having learned of the doubts raised by analysts regarding the manipulation of intelligence on Islam.
The report published on Thursday follows more detailed results as the studies continue.
In addition, the chief inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
On Thursday, the democratic members of the Committee responsible for intelligence in the House of Representatives published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Group.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process in which intelligence on the security forces of Isis and Iraq was assessed", says Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking democratic representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "has delayed the publication of intelligence results, "injureed the morals of analysts", and "sufficiently diverse views".
According to Schiff and Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to the "pre-defined or political official policy".
The News site Daily Beat reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the survey carried out by Congress.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the study of the Chief Inspector of Pentagon, which was initiated following the actions made by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon's informant, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says when he announces that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on Congress's report as long as the chief inspector's investigation is under way.
However, he says: "The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation also has other consequences, not only for its efforts to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (almost a claim made by several defence authorities).
However, the arguments put forward last year may have questioned how much President Obama can count on the Central Command and the fact that it gives a fair assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of male intelligence corresponds to differences over a decade ago, when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that, despite the protests of many analysts, President George W. Bush, supported only small troops in Iraq, and used just a little time to reflect on what would happen as a result of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Isis intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Task Force concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, the air strikes in the processors controlled by Isis had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, since it had built temporary processing and could thus sell oil in the dark market.
However, the result of the study was not passed on outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
The Centcom then commander General Lloyd J. Austin III became critical last year after many legislators assessed the statements given to the Senate as being too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he replaced General Joseph L. Votel as commander of Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth duel in women's groundhockey and strengthens its position in the arbitration with Britain
After making three goals in victory, the 6-1 match against Japan Katie Bam made two first goals for the U.S. women's country team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of the paintings they've been doing."
However, he knows: in his Olympic tournament, the Americans have won four games and lost zero games and will first share their group with Britain, which continued to win its victory line on Thursday with Japan from 2 to 0.
Britain and the United States will be playing the first round in the last game on Saturday.
Both teams survived the final match, which will determine which of them will be the first and second of the six teams.
The first person to avoid a longer encounter with the tough Dutch team who won the second block.
Despite what happens in Saturday's game, the Americans have already raised their concern for their surprising success in these competitions, four years after it remained the last 12 teams at the Summer Olympics in London.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and took his country hockey country for the first time only when he was 3 years old (his parents played the species in Drexel).
The Olympics in 2008 missed him when he failed to make his final list of players.
Next came the 2012 competitions where he and his team were not very successful.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"The reform was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our work in London wasn't what it is now.
We've done a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the paint counter during the first half-time by hitting the ball near the toast.
India had come to the game without any tournament gain, but it proved to be a surprising opposition and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam transported the ball long along the left side of the field, rolled on the middle field, hit the ball on the finish line, and thus led the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez did the last goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first event in which the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the Americans had sunk each one hit.
Briggs is now alive in his success.
Same as Bam.
"Our entry is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The Olympic lobby in the middle of the trampoline brings Zeni
Regardless of location and time, the Olympics will inevitably run into each other.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next intense communication constantly and everywhere.
Like the Olympic light itself would be a flaming communication hall that moves from a bow to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open a television, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop line without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad Le Closes' argument.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympics' first-time Dooley charm with a smile and might well be the name on all the lips that would appear and be part of the best viewing and listening time, would be popular with sponsors and would appear in good mind TV ads if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordman.
But Dooley, 28 from California Lake Forest, competes for an Olympic gold trampoline.
The Olympic light does not equally illustrate all competitions.
The distance from the center, in part the shadows are less well-known sports such as air-pistoliam, spring bomb, feather ball and taekwondo.
We'll always have bras, and we'll have our championship for a long time.
But if I have permission to write a modest story about my own special recommendation, I would like to draw attention to the slow charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since the 2000 Sydney races, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic species.
Ignorance can be a region-specific one.
Of course, the United States has participated athletes in the Olympicstrampoliin, but the country has never reached medals and has not moved to finals before 2012.
In men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russian people, and women's sides are two Canadians.
China Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLenna defend gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the substantiator, partly because of the uncivilized replacement it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(In this connection, I acknowledge that I am no expert, just a common fan.)
The species have a combination of its potential, which has been used in the drawings in endlessly continuous moments of populace of characters, but it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming pools, i.e. species that are integrally associated with trampoliin.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "sponsible board".
The ambitious champions jump with a huge trampoline, which seals them up to a height of almost 10 metres. Before landing, the jumpers of their feet must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as tours, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, the jumps are criticised on the basis of performance, difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the championship of trampoline gymnast, 16 of whom are men and 16 are women.
The trend of the most common Olympics is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, the medals have to go further, faster, faster, up and over, sometimes beyond the goal line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to a paint line or a departure wall, they also have another goal to which they are working in television-based arms, namely World or Olympics.
This determined pursuit is superior, admired, even fanatical — and even enough to get the viewer to tears.
But this is also something that I find a little shy of just watching the races.
This trampoline offers a breathlessness.
Trampoliin's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast climbs up with weightless as an astronaut, falls down and makes trouble back up.
The species, of course, also include a competitive clause, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush to paint or jump far, only a dream-like and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympics can get away.
Women's fur fights and finals take place Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men's corresponding races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends finals as part of the afternoon broadcast, starting on the day of the Kumpunak at 14.00 local time.
In the middle of the Olympics, a peaceful and wonderful moment, which, in the midst of the general humor, might be missed.
And if awareness can only be increased by providing attractive male athletes and by playing them on the subject – as the US male conquerors, Wall Street Journal recently suggested – in that case Logan Dooley is expecting only a dazzling new team of fans.
A whole generation protested at Ethiopia, a long - standing ally of the United States.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have broken down protests calling for political change across Ethiopia.
According to the witnesses, several protestors have been shot to death in concentrations with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable West ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the last few months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to larger regions.
Just last week, thousands of people attacked the streets, demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government's reaction was pathetic.
According to the witnesses, the police shot and killed a number of unarmoured protestors.
In the video described at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, we can see how the security forces are hitting young people who are forced to stand against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for thorough research.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and it is even more difficult to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, Research Manager of the International Crisis Group on the Horn of Africa.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by Western countries.
The United States Army and Intelligence Service are closely supporting the Ethiopians in fighting terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and only a few African countries, if nothing, will get so much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new wastehouse.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the democracy model country, and human rights organisations have constantly reported government repression policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and the dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far away from the wilderness.
But it could be changing.
"If the people are suppressed, and there is no alternative but to show their mind, it will come out," says Seyoum Teshome, who works as a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"All young people express their views.
"The whole generation protested."
There are many causes of dissatisfaction, from land use to government discipline.
The ruling party and its allies, after the widely criticised elections last year, were given the last position of the opposition in the past, which is the result of which they now rule the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the Eritrea border, where the heightened situation in the struggle in June required hundreds of deaths.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less destroyed separatists, such as the Orion Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Freedom Front, may try to exploit confusion and re-arm them.
There are many reasons for the bitter mood that has been coming under the surface for years now.
The first is obvious innocent: smartphones.
Only for the past few years have the Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media when the more affordable smartphones became common and internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many are able to access the Internet via brokers who hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they called people into demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, the Oromas and the Amhars.
Oromats and amhars are not natural allies.
The Amhars from above Christians in Ethiopia have long ruled the country’s politics and business and robbed the Oromas, a large part of which is Muslim and live in areas of the industry.
But it's also changing.
"Cohesion is getting deeper and we're getting under the same umbrella," says O.R. Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have just been in the Oroma and Amhara regions.
Many Amhars and Oroms experience that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population and, however, controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
The former rebel leader Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius capable of seeing behind the corner.
According to the analysts, he was particularly good at discovering the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors who agreed to avoid the opposite.
"This essential instinct is lacking in the open government," says conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemaram Desaleg, entered the Meles boots from almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemaram comes from the south.
According to the analysts, he does not have the confidence of the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
For the last time, similar riots were experienced in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands showed their minds against elections that, according to the government analysts, first took up and then stole.
In post-election unrest, many Protestants were killed, although the dead were less than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for the long-range infrastructure design, such as the new tajamajavan, and for significant progress in combating poverty.
But an inner grudge toward the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented the gymnastics.
And the grudge is about to take a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Gondari, Amharaváros, attacked by Tigre-owned companies, and the anti-tigre hate speech is becoming more widespread in social media.
According to the analysts, protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a state of tobacco.
The US Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring Somalia-observed aircraft, but according to the US, the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wishes to support democracy, it does not want its allies already in an unstable area to collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he's being sarcastic when he claims to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, tried to draw his words back in his last campaign in dispute, claiming that he was not serious when he said several times this week, that he was a terrorist group of President Obama and Hillary Clinton Isis.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican Party about the ability of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to defend themselves, will also find themselves in a difficult situation in these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made the argument at the election conference on Wednesday night and repeated during various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that he had created Isis as President and Hillary Clinton.
However, early Friday morning Trump twitted and said that he had sarcasm.
Trump passed out in the twitter all his talk the day before, when he said that he was guilty of several interviews.
When the radio driver and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by finding that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw his claim.
The last storm of criticism rose when Trump tried to concentrate his campaign back on the economy as the numbers of support fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy line in Michigan this week.
On Friday Trump tried to get back to the subject again.
On Twitter, he warned me that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and that Clinton's speech would be boring.
Trump's been defending himself with sarcasms before.
At the end of July he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's email. Later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretches the limits of political speech and pulls his words back, if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that are responding to his supporters. He sees how supporters react to messages, and "to clarify" then depending on one way or another's reactions," says Communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidents.
"But I also believe that he understands his argument and knows that they are surrounded enough to pass through the various walls."
Rather than softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even more than ever in recent days when his support figures have continued to decrease.
A new opinion poll published on Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist said that Trump's support is considerably lower in Northern Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is tight.
While Trump usually tries not to apologize for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics that they misread his words or do not understand his sense of humor.
But, having been subject to ever more accurate observation, during the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have placed his loyal supporters in a awkward position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments, no matter how provosive they are.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, defended the presidential candidate with a strong effort to interview CNN on Thursday.
"I consider his words justified by political speech," answered Giuliani when he was asked whether Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton had established Isis.
"It is true in the sense that, before Obama Isis, he was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama called a completely incorrectly "a team of the lower series" and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops away from Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to continue its efforts when it did not carry out the situation with determination in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s elections in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack media on Twitter, where he accused them of his speech’s depraving and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked "unfortunate and pathetic" television commentators who try to find out about him, but he said they couldn't do it.
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump's explanation, and they just said that it would show even more clearly that he was not the president.
Due to an excessive increase in rent, the coffee shop will open in Greenpot
Verb Cafe was a bit bloated coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash was used as a payment instrument, with no Wi-Fi, but who offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the coffee shop had to be priced out of its street shelter on Bedford Avenue when the rental went unreasonably.
Verb Cabe in the summer of 2014 became Soap Cherie sells cup-shaped soaps.
The locals consider this to be a waste of a lost café under mid-classing.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe there's no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York is no longer the same, it's also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new coffee shop in Greenpoint, only a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still inexplicable.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old coffee shop.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb order bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espressocone model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon chicken egg cheese-sandwiches available and for filling in capers and browned onion rings.
The list also has dark IDs.
There is no more beer from the coffee shop, but instead, juices made from fresh fruit.
After holding a coffee shop for nine months, Rodriguez says that he noticed that the standard customers of the old began to run a steady flow in Verb.
"In fact, many of our old customers had to be priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited the cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after his conversion to Greenpot, he made a walk to Verb, then located in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he tells me he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took his usual ice coffee instead of a chai act, which is also a list.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same thing for an exception.
"I entered the cafe every day over seven, like a machine, and there they already prepared my sandwich with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today Rosenthal still has its standard product, but sometimes he varies from bagel to bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says there's no grudge for the soap store to take the old place.
Soap Cherien’s owners even offered to produce a special soap used to produce Verb’s own cold coffee.
"We can still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
The Polish people who were traditionally living in Greenpot have also accepted the café with joy.
One of the new clients turned the menu aside, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place for it to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle up and sell the coffee shop's cold coffee.
The coffeevila may also expand into the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough for them to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says that his heart was broken when the coffee shop was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like she was home, says Whitt.
"I smelled the coffee shop."
A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after being president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office room in the White House.
As a culinaryist, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxurious feeding of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the Hanhemamaapiasteja and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: the devil’s egg (deviled egos) in tomato sauce, potato eggs and dessert from the bone mussel.
"It was an indication of culinary solidarity for people suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds: "It was also a message to the Americans, how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights works as food historians.
Coe's latest book, known as Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Zigelman's latest book, says 97 Orchard, tells the story of the floor house in Lower East Side.
Their new work is the A Square Metal, published by Harper on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
The Paris Party showed its own culinary solidarity when agreeing to meet with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and was opened in the same year as the big stock exchange break happened in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a creamy cheese and olive full of sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, on the other hand, turkey, potato juice and mixed gravy.
When the journalist ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was appropriate for a very large discussion on the eating of the recession.
"The furs were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"The people ate peanut mulberries, liver murks, and paphomores.
They were made of substances that were cheap and inadequate.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they will be enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe's gonna be all right.
"It must have been hit in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great recession, the American table of food, especially in rural areas, worked on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want".
Women cooked for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, newly-painted pies were served.
The Americans had sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Metal is a chronograph of ways in which the people survived when suddenly they had to give up luxury.
"This was the time when food became an essential and disturbing subject for the Americans" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One of the anxietys was a new favourable diet: according to Ziegelman, mystery foods such as wreaths and paprikas became the main food, and paprika was called "a powerful way to use food stars" because the chefs could cover not so attractive manufacturing preparations with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been one of the most important parts of American food, became economically used luxury.
There were strange blends where the most important was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values and not even the taste or even the healthy kitchen larvae.
When conducting a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared peanut butter-filled ovens used as a food for pula time.
"It didn't get any popularity at dinner," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
peanut butter and peanut onions don't match at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Home Economy Agency in 1923-1943, directed the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budget holders and to meet the challenge of making dusty dishes such as carrots-kermaspaget.
The A Square Deal book is a celebration of historical flavored trees.
Specially tasty are the reports of the reaction of the government leadership to its hungry citizens, such as your "Give me to eat cake" position by President Herbert Hoover.
While he publicly praised his childhood for a simple meal on an old farm, he himself ate, such as a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become of him.
"He liked continental kitchens, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate nearly in a golden-coated dining room, a tuxedo on him.
"He was completely attracted to reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged her to set an example in her stomach.
As is said in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in the flavor, the food offered in the White House was not only the most boring food in Washington, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the food from the recession was abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be seen in how we pay attention to calories and nutrients and how science has been applied to cooking.
In writing the book, Paris reports that it was better to understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, such as why she couldn’t throw away food.
"He really feared food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
"The people even began to feel bad about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For the first time, wind hats."
When the main food tables were empty at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the food they made at home, the same food that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called a plum foam," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a clear name to the modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We're going to swim across the thick brown muck.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
The second time, and the third time.
"The German nuts would do better than this," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Full compensation for the costs of the C anti-hepatitisitis medicine with Merck
The judge of the United States Court of Justice decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a full compensation for the costs of legal proceedings for the patent of hepatitis C medicinal products with Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from the damages of $200 million imposed on it by the infringement of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the successful medicines of Gilead Sovaldi and Haron.
In a complaint registered on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the U.S. Regional Court states that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees for the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenge each other's right to private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead's medicines.
United States-supported forces have taken over the city of Manbij from Isis
The U.S. troops have been taken over by the city of Manjib, near the border of Turkey, where the last extremist Isis fighters left the city, reports the crowds.
The Syrian democratic forces (SDF) are now taking the city to find the last Islamic fighters hidden in the city.
The representative of the Manbij Military Council of SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages captured by Isis' fighters have been released.
"We're in full custody now, but we're still running search operations," said Darwish.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax
President Hillary Clinton published his tax return on Friday 2015, which shows that his and his husband's income was $10.75 million at that time and their real federal tax rate 34,2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to the charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly 5.3 million dollars in speech prizes, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's book, which covered his term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton released ten years of tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to look like a model for economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier in her release.
The perfect contrast is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
The US presidential candidates have always published their tax records, even though the law does not require them.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have appealed to the tax administration's audit for the reason that Trump has not published his income data.
"Sirto is yours" twitted Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the tax records of the Democratic People's Party.
On Thursday Michael Cohen, Special Justice Assistant to Trump, told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax records until the controls were completed.
Trump’s critics, including the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members in 2012, have said that his refusal to publish information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his grants to charity, his business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this question and published a video online on Friday, where he brings out the prominent Republicans who are looking to Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the matter in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every candidate for president has been doing for decades, and not to make public tax returns," said Clinton to the people.
According to the Politico web magazine Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid only a small amount of two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times Businessescolumni quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be similar.
Federal tax rates have raised the central question of the presidential election.
According to Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor Clinton has supported a provision that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clickon election held in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the main office of the Berkshire Hathaway company, has challenged Trump's meeting, where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to an audit of the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has made tax declarations public up to 2007.
The Clintons now living in the city of Chappaqua, New York, paid a real federal tax of 32% on average between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40,5%.
According to Clinton's tax return for 2015, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was wage-related.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported their dividends and interest income at USD 109 000.

Chili powder-filled ferrets in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Natural defenders in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep the elephants away from the human settlement — elephants are alarmed by throwing chilly powder filled condoms towards them.
Keino has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation has, together with the American Nature Conservancy organisation, launched a campaign to teach volunteers from the villages of northern Denmark how to protect their homes and farming elephants without harming their homes.
A while ago, spears were used for the distress of the elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen the attitudes changed in these villages, because now the villagers can trust that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damien Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation, when he announced.
First, an intrusive elephant is alarmed by showing a flashlight and calling a horn.
If this doesn't work, let's throw a so-called chilli cloud.
The compounded chilly powder of the soil is placed in the condensed condensed with a velvet, and then the head of the condom is closed so that only the ignition thread is excluded.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine chilli powder cloud into the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last way is by throwing a fire that is known as a Roman candle into the air and creating a loud and clear explosion.
The Jewish film director criticised the Berlinian hotel for removing Israel's directional number from the Arab "host" – RT News
A French film director, a Jewish film director, born the media track, revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel does not mention Israel’s directional number in its land code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the holocaust, broke his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
At his recent visit, Lanzmann attempted to find a hotel in the direction number list provided by Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as it does not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate call center.
The director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes the reply of the reception officer upset him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the management of Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the measure was a further shock on the director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "The vast portion of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for Israel's directional number to be removed."
President Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, the German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great shame".
"The kill will stun us all.
It's a great shame.
And it is more shameful to note that we are in Germany and that this is precisely the hotel chain.
No further explanation is necessary.
We're waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The case caused quite a reaction online in which it was called scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the claims of the alleged Arab customers.
In a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue in Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes the hotel's protests quickly, called an error and apologized to Lanzmann.
"There was never a direct order to leave Israel out of the code list," writes the representative of the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the heading number has been added to the list since then.
Police used tear gas and rubber optics for the demonstration of Brazilian students
The students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to express their opinion on the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber holes against the protestors.
Mellaque began when law enforcement officials tried to break down the student force, which led to police using rubber holes and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to show their strictness to the government’s plans took part in the debate.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of the state of Sao Paulo has made a proposal for a savings measure in which nearly 100 public schools are closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the protestors made graffiti for the walls against Michel Temer, who was temporarily held by the President.
The protest of students took place only a few days after the disappearance of the sedentary protestors in favour of President Dilmo Roussef voted in the Senate on this matter.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased 71% – RT Business
Since the packages left, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Russian Iranian Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in the business in Iran has increased since the international sanctions against Iran were repealed.
"Family companies continue their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further growth of trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," says Dzhagarya.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to USD 158 million.
The trade was driven by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says Ambassador.
Dzhagarya also expects a record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran issued about 35 000 visas for Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was also, for the first time, among the 20 first countries to travel to Russia.
And it is not too bold to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia is broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Skotti Callum Skinner praised the British as he won the cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner, in his team print on Rio's Velodrom last night, when the British trio defended the championship earned in London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Skinner was in the role of an anchor who he inherited from a Scottish Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud to thank for the goal and win the victory from a New Zealand team.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won his fifth six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had only been placed in the sixth World Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had left his race career since then.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, specializing in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out just at the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race also left a hole that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scotlandn Skinner was the man to whom the British Coaches believed and where they saw the potential that he now earned.
Hindes, Hoy with the championship four years ago won by Kenny and Skinner made the Olympics in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won gold in a duel.
Hindes was on the loose after his rounds, but Kenny worked on the team's leadership, which Skinner maintained.
A large part of the change was that the strategy was modified so that Hindes was able to slow down speed at a higher rate, thanks to which Kenny and, in particular, Skinner were able to keep pace.
Hoy followed the BBC as a commentator and reached the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the award coupon.
The 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered about the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We did the Olympics at the finals and won the world champions.
I can't believe it.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning London 2012 Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on the track deliberately because of a bad departure.
Later, he canceled his word, and British competitors did not have a complaint.
This time the sovereign victory did not involve such problems.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like in London, all the British flags went off in the audience.
Our team was united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten railways in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, it is a successful five days ahead.
As Kenny has demonstrated in his ability, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy's achievements and wins three Olympic Games in one Olympic Games.
This would mean mapping an account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
In this case, medals would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes with a sprint that starts today and settles in three days.
Boltonian 28-year-old Kenny says, "In this moment, I can only be happy about this.
The team race is always the best.
You'll enjoy your victory with your friends.
To win alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he'll have to get the knight's value."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and the Oak Doull were the fastest four men on the team race.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, which was made in London 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (klo 22.42) are being competed today on the second day of competition, and the attention will certainly be focused on Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition agents before the time-limits when they invited him to measure his length.
In the same women's race that goes on and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald, from Milgavie, reached world record time 4:1.3.60.
The United Kingdom team can now rely on its awesome cycling team to assume responsibility for the middle Olympics and bring a series of medals to the country.
After the actual evidence received in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of claims about sex and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, competitions in velodrom on the first night show that the legendary reputation of the United Kingdom is once again taking place at the perfect moment.
The future of the Portland melting plant at stake due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium alloy plant in the state of Victoria and, therefore, thousands of workers’ jobs are at stake when the power company for the melting plant told us that one of the owners of the plant is about to break down the supply contract and it is expected that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victoria Government not to continue with the support that the factory is operating.
The fixed 20-year grant will cease in November.
The Alcoan Portland plant is at risk of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result of the closures, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The effects of snowballs may continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry’s melting plant, which led to the closure of Anglesea’s power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland alloy loses money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to speculations about the future of the factory for years, first caused by Australia's strong dollar and recently the cost of manufacturing the factory.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium alloy plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it is expected that the other three plant owners will also cease their contracts.
The majority owner of the factory is a joint venture between Alcoa and Aluminium. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority participations.
AGL says that it expects the permanent operation of the Portland production plant, which means that physical electricity demand from the meltdown will continue.
AGL reports that the agreements were to enter into force in November 2016.
The period of termination of contracts shall be 12 months and shall end in 2017.
"So AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the accounting year 2017," says the power plant.
The possible return effects on AGL from the accounting year 2018 are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounting for $187 million in 'prevention of termination'.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the agreements does not affect Alcoa's capacity to maintain a melting plant or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant.
The American company reported that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
As a result of the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their assessments of both the melting plant in the state of Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, an operational director of AGL, said earlier in his speech to analysts that at annual level, Portland uses some 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, this means a significant drop in demand on the (electricity) market.
For us as a producer, it would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Cardashians TV stars Kendall as the cover girl in the Vogue September
The model of Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of his mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, posera in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's commercial growth and has played in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"Looking at me in a room full of my dearest ones got me into tears", Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover picture was followed by a strange video (or perhaps only by Kardashianit-series style?), handwritten by all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (Bargamik Rob and Caitlyn and all the favorite ones, the Kardashianit programme producer Ryan Seacrest), forgetting that they had forgotten their sister's cover photo. The video ends in a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliche, and it is used in almost every birthday period of the ace program (Seacrest says the words: "Did you know that we've forgotten you?" just as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon, but Kris had to get other daughters in some way into this audience.
For the presence in Vogue’s September issue is without doubt a new era of Kardashian.
Kendal’s Isosko Kim may have arrived before the action of Vogue (now appeared on Vogue’s cover together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is exactly his own class.
The September issue is Vogue's most sold publication every year.
More of its thickness than a fashion magazine-like number attracts a large number of promoters (the fashion site from Fashion decreased that the 832 page op last year had 615 pages of advertising).
The publication of the September issue is so highly expected that, in the past two years, the images of the magazine have leaked into the public even before the official notification.
Previously, the cover designs were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been celebrities on the work of the model rather than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior advertising plant Jennifer Lawrence was in the cover picture in 2013, and one year later, Lady Gaga received the honor.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he is more likely to read among the celebrities that work for the model, he is still in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, true-TV stars or modern children who know how to make a goodnapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry over others.
The Beyonce in the cover photo last year has one of the strongest years of his career when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of his true-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a sport.
In June Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "breeds".
These feelings have returned to the surface when the news of Jenner's presence on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, the continuing decline in discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking in Marc Jacobs' fashion studios.
He's the commercial growth of Estee Lauder.
He and all his sisters sell images of themselves through paid applications.
He sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she photographed on the LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on reality TV, maybe just a way to meet her sister and her kids.
Legal aid centres turn 160 000 people away a year
The most vulnerable person in more than 160 000 countries each year will be turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector will be prepared for the effects that additional cuts in appropriations will have on centres already operating at extreme limits.
In the Queensland state, three out of five people who are applying for legal aid and asylum services have already been turned away — the majority of them are old, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violence and unfounded decisions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, which have already been overloaded already, are preparing for additional cuts in appropriations.
Since June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing 30% more of federal funding.
James Farrell, head of Queensland Public Aid Centre, says that according to the latest calculation report drawn up by the National Organisation for Legal Assistance Centres, thousands of people are already turned away from centres annually.
If the federal government doesn't pass its decision, Farrell says it's only gonna get worse.
"Queensland Public Aid Centres are constantly under-funded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away when they seek the services they need," says Farrell.
"The people who come out of the relationship, the people who fall under the uncontrollable and maiming debt burden, the families who are divorced, the workers who have been unduly dismissed – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the poorest in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland's Senator George Brands to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to national average level.
It is now time to take account of the needs of the public legal aid centres and their customers, and the Government of Palaszczzz has to invest in this important work."
Against Donald Trump's campaign, a complaint against the worker's threat was raised with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued when no action was supposed to be taken after its leader was told that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened the worker with a gun while driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in a complaint made by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini, on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte.
Bordini says that she had waited months for the campaign to be dealt with internally before she realized, according to her own words, that this would not happen.
According to Bordini, campaign manager Earl Phillip took the pistol out, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe into Vincent's knee slot.
According to the complaint, after a complaint campaign was made to local and regional leaders, Bordini was informed that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"While the weapon doesn't fire, it's causing damage," says Bordin in his suit.
The action will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused public rage when he said to the people in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second extra term" – which are held as gun owners and armamentists – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets elected judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media removed his word in context and Trump did not encourage violence.
As regards the campaign, Bordini claims compensation and Phillip compensation for assault, assault and mental suffering.
Hope Hicks, the informant of Trump, did not respond immediately to the message that asked him for a comment.
They didn't want Phillip anyway.
Charlotte's local news office in WCB told me about Phillip's campaign recently left.
No immediate response was received to Phillip's consulting service.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been engaged in a controversial campaign.
Court case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
The United Kingdom must use the Olympic Spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also restores the economy and creates prosperity — not only in local communities and London — but in the whole country.
For myself, this was one of the most interesting things to do in Heathrow. As we did at the Summer Olympics in London in 2012, we invested enormously in the fact that our whole nation and all our regions will benefit from them.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, thereby removing youth unemployment in the nearby areas of the airport.
As at the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who believe that the expansion of Heathrow is too great a challenge.
As far as the Olympics were concerned, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in a awkward position in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and will also be wrong about Heathrow.
The winning obstacles will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many instead of small ones.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to raise the economy by £211 billion, bringing skills and employment both to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great task force at Heathrow, which has carried out in time and by keeping in the budget an infrastructure investment programme of GBP 11 billion, which included the T5 terminal, which has been voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two most congested runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway with a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to extend Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Government and former Minister of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook promotional exhibition in cat mouse play
The attempts of companies that earn money from online advertising to mislead advertising software have become a cat mouse game, says one of the companies producing blocking programmes.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it would block advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog writing, where it said that users could update their blocking software filters and thus again prevent social service advertising.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would be more difficult to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
Now, however, Adblock tells us that he's found out the new codes.
Ben Williams, Adblock's informant, wrote in a blog, that "this kind of ball-up between the open source advertising community and the delusioners has been running since the adstation was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon do its own repair shop again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has participated in the fight is a strong indication of the concern that advertising promoters have become involved.
It is estimated that 200 million people worldwide are using advertising collection programmes, reports the survey carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users daily on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to contribute to the misleading of advertising programmes in its Desktop application, as according to the notifier, mobile advertising blocking programmes do not operate on Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram.
The income from Desktop advertising remains high enough, which is why Facebook considered it to be profitable to invest.
Tuesday Facebook also reported that it would update the user settings advertising tool to allow users to more control how to target ads in them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticised Adblock's new filters, as they also prevent the appearance of some ordinary Facebook scripts.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said the Facebook editor in his e-mail release.
"The advertising prevention programmes are unscrupulous and inefficient, and that is why we have instead invested in developing user regulations such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving a car under the Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for assistance from witnesses on the highway on Thursday for the first hours of an accident in which a woman deliberately fell under more than one car.
The accident occurred on the A1 engine road near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her desperate work by lying on the dark road, and she was hit by more cars, says Vadi police.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his attempt was clearly to commit suicide.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have yet to be identified, and the police are asking them or other witnesses of the accident to report.
The lawyer, Gilles Hofstetter, reports in Le Tribune de Geneva that criminal investigation has been launched, a logical step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the charges are being charged with the drivers involved in the accident.
"Is it impossible to avoid a collision?
It'll stay for the D.A.," says Hofstetter.
Two similar cases have taken place in the last five years, which are not considered to be responsible for drivers.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person walked on a dark highway and the court decided that drivers could not expect to run into a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year the police authority was released from the charge that had been charged with the death penalty after he was attacked by a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one of August night 2014.
The judge heard that the 22-year-old victim had enjoyed a lot of alcohol and went off the road.
The court considered that the police – which was responding to an emergency call – were justified and the way in which the man lying on the road was “the exceptional and unforeseen situation”.
All roads about the accident near Morges are invited to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44 on Thursday.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus’ past with the same tools and algorithms as climate researchers use.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes have been similar to those on earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its gas frame is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to researchers' previous presentations, the slow speed of circulation of Venus is explained by its thick gas frame.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to the earth, and has still been running slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early Venus surface formation.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid devastation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent darker.
"In GISS's model, Venus spins slowly, and its half per sun is almost two months at a time," says the GIS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This heats up the surface and generates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like a umbrella and protects the surface from much heat of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model created the story of Venus, which corresponds to past assumptions from planetary researchers about its development cost.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and UV light for several billion years.
Its oceans disappeared, and the UV light burned the steamed water.
As Vedy escaped into space, only the thick carbonic gas supply and the lethal effects of the greenhouse — that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus weather model in the Geophysical Research Letterers magazine.
Patrick Roy will give up his place as Avalanchen coach.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and Deputy Head of the Association’s hockey operations, relying on a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Vice President/Chairman of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the company would immediately begin to seek out a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have carried out my mission as Chief Commander of the Colorado Avalanche Team and Vice President of the Association's Ice-Eight Action, with a strong, passionate and determined attitude," says Roy in his 50-year-old communication.
"I've been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level during the summer.
In order to achieve this, the Deputy Director-General of Coach and Society’s hockey activities shall be fully associated with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that influence the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league year for his first season as Avalanchen's lead coach in 2013-2014.
Under his leadership, the company reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not been able to continue for the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the period 2015-2016 and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild when he played from the second place of Wild Card at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cupia in his career – two in Montreal Canadiens and two in Avalanchen rows.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators tell us that the North Sea oil workers will be interrupted as I argue with all the parties involved in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oilfield services, has been held in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties "Wood Group and Trade Unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have reopened the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will have to hold several summer meetings throughout the coming weeks, where we will deal with new issues.
Trade unions justified their recent activities, which they claim to be the first for more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group is cutting around 9% of its contractors in the North Sea this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows the calculation of prices of contractors working in countries by 10 % in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts provide it with the mobile space necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of workers out of the pay list and announced its plans to leave oil and gas extraction activities in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to step up its operations with the British energy company BG Group after its megafusion.
The lower crude oil prices and the economic situation, as a result of the UK June decision to leave the European Union, create pressure for energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, from Scotland, met with the head of staff earlier this week in order to discuss one of the largest accidents in the North Sea, experienced in the entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not just few," says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be under USD 1.4 billion in 2016, after some EUR 7 billion have been used over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the star range of Plejajas
The latest task of the Kepler Spacescope has been to measure the speed of the stars, which has helped the astronomers to gather the most comprehensive list of the speeds of rotation of the stars in the Plejad's range so far.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same range are spinning at different speeds and how orbits are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that, by comparing the results to the rest of the group, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even the history of the solar system," says the researcher at the University of Pasadena, Luisa Rebull, an infra-red processing and analysis centre.
The star range of the Plejads is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They're running faster than ever at the moment.
With the speed of rolling at the top of the growing stars, large amounts of stars are released from the stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the stars' magnetic fields.
When the star is older, its speed of rotation is slowing down.
Kepler will measure the speed of rotation for each occasion by following the time between the emergence of the identifiable star spots (corresponding to sunlight).
The latest listed speed data indicate that larger stars are running slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — larger cyclists are slower than smaller ones.
"We'll see the Plejad 's dance' that slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spiners are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the star range of Plejadi is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the star properties in relation to the speeds of rotation.
"The star range of the stars offers a support pillar for theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars", says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information on how, when and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and end their dance.
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speeds of the Plejads in their three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
