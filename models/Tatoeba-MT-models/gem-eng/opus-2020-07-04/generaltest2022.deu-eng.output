The goods have cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods...
I'm #PRS_ORG# big business, so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be traced by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Frankly, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
I also think, in principle, that children should not be allowed to play a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I also find it good for large siblings to take care of the little ones in measure.
Let's take a look, help briefly, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help and are involved in the family.
As long as they can be enough child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can determine for yourself whether this is appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's going to roll K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
It's probably a questionable legal matter.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes as well.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Krimi / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole action, but the title partout doesn't want to bother me anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was of fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by spilling his food and walking into his predators.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation of his therapists, runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There will be more suicides and there will be another protagonist - a photographer who is sent anonymously before each suicide to go to the site of the suicide and document the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides to death)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this act is known to someone or someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, je je, I don't have the password for the Wlan available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that may take some time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back ?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumb nail
Child, four years, has over the entire length of wood splitter under the thumb nail (outside).
Tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost every locomotive of H0 and 0 track gauges.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large sugar cube speaker plus sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving levels are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register at an appropriate digital centre fully automatic.
It dominates all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with appropriate stations.
For Centrals that can only program the CVs of 1-255, there exist utility registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving levels at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses enable the resolution of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx®-compatible stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, he also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pedestal train machine enables automatic commuting between two railway stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC tracks.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to drive recovery vaccination
Always new Omikron cases bring politics and science to the UK.
All qualified adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer until the New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster than has been the case so far in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a previously recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.
One faced an emergency in view of the Omikron variant, which is why the protection of the vaccine needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose.
"Let's get up," Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, with which the total number rose to 3137.
Compared to the previous day this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
is the full amount refunded by the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favour of everyone pretending to be pronouns.
I sent off an application.
Today the invitation came by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Somebody help me, please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want any officials to step over my feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronouns.
I've got a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today can't
Obviously, the chair had an unobtrusive lack of sales.
How can such a upholstery occur after 9 months otherwise ?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working for about a year.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and I wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to my order and invoice that.
[CW] The feeling that I can't help.
Content-Warning: I'm going to write here a little bit more detail about domestic violence.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) get in contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A theme that really nudes at me and unfortunately is too common that many victims are not able to help or think we can't help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and listening, I cannot reach all.
I don't know what's the reason, maybe it's fear of revenge, of leaving the usual social environment, of getting the kids out of this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is, in part, very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so unimaginably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series add to "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg bei den Merlins Crailsheim
At least at Youngster Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Again nothing: for the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said to the Hakro Merlin's Crailsheim, "We still have a bit of anger in our stomach, looking back at the Cupal defeat at the beginning of October".
He did not lie after the game but rose again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
Even more than the naked result, the way of appearance disappointed.
The vice-president mentioned a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The trio ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young John Patrick) on saying and writing 31 attempts - even more questions?
John Patrick gave the answer: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were simply not focused enough, and have not implemented what we have trained".
It's like moving the ball.
His response to Sebastian Gleim was quite different: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky Coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their expense.
Last but not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained" still praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team itself the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already settled 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Thankfully, a lot of time for hating is not going to last.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have another address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I called in a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims have been rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore called on them again.
Originally, we've been in touch six months ago.
Always plucked out of the egg: Max Raabe gets 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of drummers from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the move with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to occur.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not going to do anything.
The planned concert was staged in May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the Corona virus.
Other appearances planned during the Advent period must also be seen first, as the singer's website, which today becomes 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de) says.
From January, the artists will then take up their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung much and gladly as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with Kommuntonen.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "For Women That's Not a Problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and thought about labels, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music landscape is no longer to think away.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small pattern piece of furniture wood in advance?
It is complemented with existing furniture and so we could check before whether it fits colour
It still does not work I can only tend the cover but do not leaf.
Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has expressed its opposition to the expropriation of large housing companies, as requested in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation no new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private tenants, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopolistic formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation was not relaxed, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market is not relaxed, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.
Hi, I wanted to order something and I noticed after a few days that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be available again ?
Or whether it'll even come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NAMEBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I solve it myself during the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is sent in March, how long will the shipment take?
I've already cut my finger.
That's an absolute fright
At least 100 deaths by Tornados in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be lamented.
The pictures from there remind you of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused severe devastation and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind a snowfall of about 320 kilometres, especially in Kentucky.
His Governor Andy Beshear said that everything was gone after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was swept through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred dead in Kentucky alone, the official figures are increasing every hour.
Hello, I've just seen that she's sold out display cabinet #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been removed entirely from the assortment?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
Until when do you log in?
If delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or gave up a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this was arrived or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums.
They are therefore on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to receive Corona vaccinations.
He changed to a company he was blasphemous about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he did not get stuck in his old position and looked for something else.
You may, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, I don't care.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the pot!
I'm currently directing for a group of 4 friends the adventure Over the gripping pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a specially written campaign for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains written and their motivations, the single file designed and now I am in the process of writing the entrance adventure and already stumble on my own feet at the first encounter.
The premium is that the heroes are to bring a ferry with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There the further action is to develop.
Some miles away from the village, the heroes are supposed to build up a group of Goblins and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: persuasion, action, threats, early detection of the danger, whatever happens to players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and saddles
If the Goblins do not notice, the heroes will lie up in a hollow path and flank to each of three left and right bows arming the drive, while two with spears stop the drive.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject to, I have two approaches to the solution
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, half a man.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-dollar with two of his servants, and come to the aid of the mighty in the battle.
The cart is still there, all great.
How fitting do you keep Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter as an entry into the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I hadn't counted on so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I am guaranteed to master many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can then make the return tickets, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am genericd by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more so that I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was cancelled in order to start on time with the F1 pre-reporting.
Although the late start and start of the schedule was far behind the planning, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been demonstrated.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and therefore has to limit itself to everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Even so stupid, especially since Sky UK has sent the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the severe accident.
Then in the F1 there was a rule ignorance again with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that one should change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that steppes can change the tires when there were corresponding radio statements on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this option was available to the staff.
I think you should know such elementary rules when commenting on the F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle-rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally, with the artificial comment style of Roos does not like it, but admit that the taste thing is.
But I really even like Heiko Water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant ambiguities that make both simply seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at (also unmistakable) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment that he apparently does not take this seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to F1TV since only the German track has to come out without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two channels in the trainings make less advertising than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone doesn't make me overlook the disadvantages.
The other program of Sky Sport F1 is also very thirsty and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter that transmits the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job at the four races that they are still allowed to transfer to advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolor glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will review and send an email and she has never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for help.
Fan pumps are ideally suited to supply an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifts.
This series is offered in 3 variations from us.
Look in the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect more outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the fan pump model, but also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure rest, a shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an Auströmer 4/6 mm by means of an air hose and so on... and it can start already.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than, the water level and fitted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a deceleration valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards, running the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the air pump is fitted outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up here every day.
Running well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent anyone from getting upset, just because it took a little longer.
It would be, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding system... of course here doesn't make a Corona stop.
Please do not judge equally badly, just because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively due to the parcel services.
One likes to talk about these services, even if we say at the moment, they've got it damn hard
This is also regionally very different.
Be no one evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you also order your legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the Blue Origin company of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of Texas.
Under radiant blue skies, Bezos personally received the newly selected astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa astronauts flying into space (1923-1998), after which Blue Origin's missile system was named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not announce.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard with his efforts and do everything himself.
She was just like that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometres above the earth, temporarily with no gravity, before the reusable object braked off by large parachutes again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above the Earth as a frontier to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-excursion of Blue Origin: At the first time in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second time in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy boss of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics propose Bezos and Blue Origin to pursue the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of mankind and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
I have, of course, already informed myself before studying about career prospects, but also at the time that I would definitely like to study and become a doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the professional prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) one hears again and again super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand one hears again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid places.
That's why I'd be really interested in it.
1) As what do you currently work?
2) Are you satisfied with your work / salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and think about ending my studies and making an education as a specialist informant in 2022.
If you have experiences, they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now a post.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are those also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week, Maria Assumption, which is called "Auffahrt" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday most of the people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what went on last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lauter e-mails, which had to get out before the ride, order here, all *indistinct* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to do all the serious things in a shorter week as much as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I also had a lot to do with it.
What's this self-gathering supposed to do about holidays?
What more holidays do we have if we are not allowed to treat them properly?!
The stress did not come well from above, the colleagues were all quite independent of it.
My question is: Are we the only ones like this, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed Evangelical way?
Or do you know the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringia home - but still has no gifts.
"The beautiful one, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
They will agree to the feast by baking and bastling with their son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
Up to the days of her mind, however, she has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any presents yet, I have to start at last."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the mouse and the feather renewal.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
Most of the periphery damage caused by birds is due exclusively to food defects.
Since the feather is made up of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the bird is required for the formation of an impeccable feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed products is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin medicinal product should be used during use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON Bio is water soluble and can simply be administered via the drinking water or via the soft food.
Thank you. I found it.
Unfortunately still doesn't work
DDR craft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive is probably derived from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with track tracks and missing parts see photos, function good, the series E 95 is a heavy freight train locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal rail trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are able to operate
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to present proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry on this track 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains at 45 km/h of travel speed.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined on delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a tattoo bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives received operating numbers E 95 01–06 were delivered.
All survived World War II and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as repair equipment.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnerungswerk Dessau, the quality of construction of all six locomotives was established.
[4] When the progressive re-electrification of the medium German network resulted in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight trains, in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed, and the other machines served as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 existing in larger units were first built up preferably.
Only when the E 94 showed that the number of reprocessing operations could not be increased further did the E 95 come into the perspective of the reprocessing process.
[4]In the beginning, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the train station Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own orbital plan in front of coal trains from the Geisel Valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, complicated control of locomotives proved problematic.
So it was more often that shooters remained stuck in control shops.
Then the beeman who was always on this locomotive had to release the shooter with hammer and wooden wedge again during the ride.
Damage to the motors occurred more often and resulted in months of failure at the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new building locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to give up on old locomotives and most split holes, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn electric locomotives only wanted to occupy one-manly, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions of the cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid 1969, they followed the E 95 01, which terminated the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future E 77 10 museum locomotive on the main station Halle.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external development of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since been part of the Transport Museum Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986 the inner completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale) the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational development of locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time as an exhibition at Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external painting, with the transformers being checked and five motors operating.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the off-road sideways, where they were proven due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines to Leipzig were relocated to the medium German network.
Main application area was first Silesia
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, optical finishing at the locomotive is necessary in its own work, dusted in, with track tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcraft model, very small edition- possible the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may contain labels and traces of storage.
Yes the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some.
The center bar is held by two feet.. Unfortunately these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately faulty produced.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I'm gonna get a new one.
So when are they going to be sent off?
No flats.
That's, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones of the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Mainly they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me
Can I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
House fire with two light-damaged and high damage
Two people have been easily injured during a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to two residents, the information was sent to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not proceed from a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over further investigations.
But it's coming a lot later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To disengage Fake-News - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021
Biontech-Chair Uğur Şahin had not yet made a public statement about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him, and she told him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives vaccination against the Corona virus.
In the social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often frowned upon by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German Wave is circulated, in which Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am currently not allowed by law to receive the vaccine itself," said Şahin back then.
There is a prioritisation in Germany in the vaccination of varicose veins.
In the meantime, the prioritisation is long overdue - and the Biontech boss has been three times impounded according to appropriate information.
Fire in transversal system: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity anymore and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralysed a transversal station.
After a fire with severe damage in a reversing station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to escape without electricity for about 24 hours.
Through the fire, the lights went out to 41,000 people affected on Friday evening in several municipalities.
The supplier Westnet reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units were in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers supported the municipalities.
The authorities offered places of care in schools and called for neighboring assistance.
The supplier thanked the concerned for their patience and for their efforts with the helpers.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts," said the Head of Primary Technology, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the West Netz Monteurs were able to take back into operation only on a provisional basis, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire following company statements.
Power flows again
The fire broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m. has greatly damaged parts of the 10,000-volt shell system according to Westnet's information in the Neunkirchen-Selscheid reseller station.
There is a need for elaborate cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a link to a 30,000 volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6:00 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 21.30 a.m. on.
Since 23.15 o'clock also had the last electricity affected by the failure.
More than 80 west network and partner companies were in operation.
Following the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighbourhood take care of elderly or single people and communicate with the local fire brigades when assistance is needed," stated Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the construction and operation of emergency power units, the residents of Altenheimen were particularly focused.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary school-care facilities have been established for those who were unable to provide themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or who need medical attention.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy those from you and pay in euros?
This is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy .
But I can't put the underlay on the table top.
This is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we have 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it into each other and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I'd appreciate a feedback
Yeah, that's really easier!
Then let's do it!
Will you send me the return card by e-mail?
the repair is now complete.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do this now?
I find such low credit to be almost unashamed.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Combine Riiber wins

When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes we have made both s new and use the version 4.5...
Could be that they've heard of problems many times.
Had directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.

I have to work in between!
To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Pull the brush evenly stitch next to Strich.
A slight overlap of the layers of color later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick wipes with the brush.
This creates unrealistically active areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones may otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unsightly metal loops when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you destroy them.
Original faithful appearance reaches the models through the Decals or decanting images.
From high-ranking signs to airplanes to ship names to ornamental moulds and car models, the Decals give the model the last cut.
Apply the Decals in the correct order as long as the components are still well accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be mounted or more easily before it is incorporated into the hull.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks, are the time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slide pictures, because you briefly moisturize their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the seams.
Then you slide the picture just a small piece from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moisturized before).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you pull off the carrier paper sideways.
Caution: Always check if the picture is sitting correctly before you completely shift it from the paper so that it doesn't stick to the finger, crushes or even scratches.
Soak excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and search for the place until where I have read it.
AM Saturday I've already communicated with you.
Do I get this by e-mail?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you so much anyway!
Then I'll buy somewhere else once the money's back.
Do I get this back easily?
Child benefit in PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello, together.
we were in child-wreck treatment for some time, now that it's about billing with the car, it's suddenly going around.
The series by:
We had applied for the child's request in advance at the PKV and got the promise of 3 attempts.
The tests were restricted in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they did not yet calculate with the car.
We again applied for the cost acquisition at the PKV and received another 3 further tests.
After some further tests (we have done more tests than promised, logically calculate the most expensive with the car) we submitted the bills to the car and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the car wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second child request is a new insurance case.
According to General Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends if treatment needs no longer exist."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to replace the PKV (only 3 attempts are made) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the car have had to point out to us in the commitments that with a birth the further attempts were to be made?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed egg ladders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts were to give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best achieve them again
All right.
We're not going to order anything from them anymore.
When they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customer.
They are happy to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was made and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything to cause the dress to get completely disturbed.
Please see what the colleague has written in the screenshot
It is clear that the refund has been made and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can align their manager that they have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must maintain normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as a chair.
Regardless, the 24 month warranty applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to remove the closet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be advertised with additional stools to purchase, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly is a low-budget film, there is no general definition with precise budget boundaries.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low budget film** or **low budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major movie studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's the big deal?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Halfer Sieg" versus Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' borders with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU had not successfully resolved the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This condition of silence - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
The handling of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Obviously there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not take decisive action against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This trend at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It appears that it cannot be enforced when a Member State puts itself in the head to make its thing", as currently Poland, which does not even allow access to the border by the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy would be made more difficult, as the "border protection, border protection and border protection" line had been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross-border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have tried again to reach the Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday at night and brought back to the border, said a public spokesperson on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been stoned in the incident near the town of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the evidence, a soldier was met on the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border locks.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have or have tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU calls on Alexander Lukashenko as the leader of power in Minsk to have attracted her with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania issued press reports according to border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has then thrown its market power into the balances and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough banners and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal policy costs.
Belarusian society is probably not adjusted to the fact that the security apparatus regularly drags thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen believes that Mercedes committed two regular breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 final, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver arrows assume two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in Red Bull in the last security car phase, when he is supposed to have overtaken regularly.
A second opposition was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not complied with.
On the last round of Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes, his first Formula One title had been overtaken by the team.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overtaken driving cars ahead of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
In the course of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read the sold out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitive to the nightly sounds at her door.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but I did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question has been answered.
It doesn't everyone have the time for your clumsy chat and improperly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not all of our household.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemit means nothing.
It's like a fan says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of you will not admit it.
But Colleagues constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it complete.
Yeah, then you're just as serious as Colleague.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
For my sake, a God has made it all work.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science only zapped nonsense.
And with that, you're a science enemy and not to take any more seriously like Colleagues.
In order to obtain an optimal visual field, the magnification should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatically acromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnification and colour error-free to the edge zone.
Often loops are marked with magnifying indications.
However, these indications only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely comply with the conditions of use.
To make optimal use of your magnifying glass, please note the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also in the case of impact valves - light reflexes arise.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection coating.
When complying with the optimal conditions of use - magnification close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannensel in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced such a curious situation when selling tanning.
Once, even without his partner, a man is supposed to have gone home because both couldn't agree.
Every year he plants well 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a number of curious situations.
It's always making fun of the pre-Christmas season, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm away as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled at a spinning spear.
So both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "driver", which by far does not sound so delicious.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connector and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbits without any failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the Wifi, does not reach the full 500 anymore, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently used a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why glass fiber is "losing" so much Internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely hard to put LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Who would have thought that now would be peace with the giro cons, can see himself deceived.
While many banks have used autumn to get their customers to confirm the increase in fees in the past with all kinds of tricks, the free-at-charges for negative interest rates continue to decline.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quailed for the day's money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts and 25 .000 euros for daily money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free money in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of EUR 25,000 or less, according to the numbers of the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sarda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centrals, who, in the first instance, have been given the right in front of the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now, it is already being discussed in the banks whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper bodies also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and that many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your lives are like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her who made 2021 with the "Friends" Reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they treat themselves to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a ONE chip out of the bag).
The fact that the heart of the female and male fans is still flying in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just having bad luck - and she's still looking for the great love.
And the baby wish was removed from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even slower than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and wiped the sweat off the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight band touch, Räikkönen had to leave his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates for farewell.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the winning of the 2007 Ferrari World Championship.
He made 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich fetches 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte wins in Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobpilot.
"I figured this out, I had to go nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it until Cortina 2026," said the BSC Oberbärenburg double Olympic winner, who booked two successes at the Winterberg races in two days.
Only on Saturday did he defend the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something about the material setting and made a bigger advantage on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he worked in front of Briton Brad Hall.
==References====External links==
"We have taken a greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came second to fifth place this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he'd do differently, I'd do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
On her way home, Laura Nolte won the third season in the doubles.
After it was only for the fourth place the day before in the Monobob, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday with German three-time success with Anschieber Deborah Levi.
Two Bob Olympian Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first podium this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super good at development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were okay," Burghardt said, stressing: "It's not only pushing, but there's also a lot to do about it."
Jamanka annoyed a little about the not quite flawless journeys, but said, "It's in the right direction".
I had the blanket already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get him, and therefore I can't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Through Corona last year I had quite different problems and never had time for them.
And now it was said that he ran out of what was very angry with me.
Look into the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was no such long delivery time on your website
No only when I tip on it comes an extra field with the message
Has been taken away from your colleague yesterday.
Why is that a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the misdelivered would.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I've got something I just want to write, and maybe it's the one or others that...
I'm 24, got kPTBS, full-time student and dogema - sometimes apart from my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has taken a burn 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also had emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we had a lot of chatter and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the dressing wg burning).
He is cooled upstairs and we currently see less (1-2x week) what makes me very much to create with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just had a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he's in his cockroach and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it's just gone for a month.
Now, too, housework is on our way, which we naturally divide.
But cooking itself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and managed.
Not good, but I'm fine and I'm almost symptom free.
My university just demanded a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after that I should prepare Anatomy hours for which I should at least do something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes then is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place left.
So my week goes like this, only until the day after tomorrow, then it's a weekend.
But after that all goes on?
Just till the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just till weekend.
Just till...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just just so stressed out that I need these mental clues because otherwise I'll pack it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that what you're doing?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful I don't have to work.
I really cannot thank you for that.
I don't know if I'd otherwise have survived my kptbs.
I think this has a lot to do with Mental Load of women, too, and that's why I thought I'd find sufferers here...
I certainly wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery, the colour was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to change the table, I'll get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times.
But she was not confirmed.
I found in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is only another subject for them, such as math or geography.
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and so always believed.
How do you like it?
You may also be able to tell colleagues about different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
Gives a curriculum, etc.
But simply find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity theory.
If you don't believe it, what will lead you to want to teach religion?
True culture or something?
Hope you have a question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write like English I understand that well
It's been a long time, I'd miss it.
It's all right, thanks.
I expect a feedback by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search Help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a film for young people.
There are two eras (or parallel worlds) in the film.
For one thing, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it any more in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform like that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The Antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live himself I mean.
I think the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that says anything to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept only on the abdomen from week one.
Fast forward: still living :D
Relax.
A child like that lasts a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything's right, not cuddly animals, often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it stand up from the belly from something?
Or is it with the face facing directly in the mattress?
That's why you can tell me if everything's okay.
We've all grown up, too, and when my husband came into the world, it was like a walk, and it was that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
Besides, we are already "stammering" with you and have already bought many products
But then why are you offering me only EUR 20?
Hello, I already wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is not currently to be used.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
Just so it's just that the policy of this transmitter is now under control.
Almost every format is sponsored (oc), but then at the same time go on a big beggar tour.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Quotation Arno: You want to be "no running litness column".
What are you doing?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They can, of course, continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How are you supposed to feel about all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a roll call, as my delivered wooden table has been broken.
Corpus break through damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in stomach pain or just for cuddling – my little warmth friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Kirschkern cushions are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, as cherry seeds can absorb heat very well and return dosed.
The removable inner cushion can easily be heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel secure even if they don't feel so well.
The cherry core cushion with reference is suitable as a heat coating exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odour, stick or fire stains and immediately dispose of them when present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's specifications!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion in the cover.
During the first warming, the surface may produce a slight formation of moisture, but it disappears with repeated applications.
You must adhere to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (flamming and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that a heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been returned in connection, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh haematomas, bruising and open wounds as well as in people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases as well as pregnancy, please contact your doctor before using this medicine.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are released, discard the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child’s temperature should be checked regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious events occurring in relation to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Zweiter - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the football league.
Thus, Hannover 96 works from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it also does not run under the third coach.
Jubel in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over Interim Trainer Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed state under the new Coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone is also enough to operate.
Missing display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite inserted power supply.
So I've expanded the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there something else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 liter capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need for everyday objects remains well organized and segregated by the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of Everyday Line on version 2 (V2) the series is presented in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has made it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still provide access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the lid flap that can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proved itself with the Messenger Bags.
A metal hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack is located in the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "filling positions": there are 4 anchor beams, stablely destroyed, in which the hook can be hooked.
When the backpack is loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, one deeper.
The flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliably without breaking the hooks.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack also fundamentally from others, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to feel through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday fitness of the backpack: because not only do you take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus store both seamlessly apart - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday stuff stays secure in the left half of the backpack and does not come in between.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjustable carrying belts help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, even if it is intended to go to Scotland in autumn, the content will remain dry.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email of their support.
#NAME# has given me yesterday an email out of confirmation for commissioning the
Contact by the forwarder announced to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received a message.
I'm asking for immediate resolution.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with no one I came further than to the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
So when can the cabinet be delivered?
Keeping him that way is not an option for me...
It's working.
Many thanks for the help
Would you like a nice evening?
Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was 12.1.11.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give up a larger order, but after all, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year, unlike I thought, I couldn't have known and just couldn't redeem and clear it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer, and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically worked (borrowed and cut).
All tinted slices are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain slices and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which is aimed at balancing the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tinned discs manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, the openings created increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake discs.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted disks underscore the character of each car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event marked the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered blazing cracks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called '49 California Gold Rush'.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were put out, tents opened, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share in the country's wealth.
For many it was called: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrupt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding streams and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to exceed your pioneer colleagues in order not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to budget your resources and set up a Tableau, which is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Afterwards their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, he gets a lock!
This disables the half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players perform alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening up shops and positioning gunshelding.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the award winner turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on for so long until the pricer has moved five times, so every location has once hidden and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have assisted enough gunshelders and the bandits are numerically superior, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is done.
The player with most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I looked at it immediately.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is happy to be a guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become tyrants" (2008), he launched a heated debate on education.
Former patient:The parents now raise serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible people must never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the framework as large for the child as it is useful and possible in the situation.
Brr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: countries advise on removal of the test requirement for triple vaccinations
At its next meeting, the Ministers for Health want to decide on a federal removal of the test requirement for triple vaccination.
"We countries need clarity as to when and when the test can be taken for three times," said Klaus Holetsek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, "image on Sunday".
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinations is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional improbation," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministerial Conference on this subject on the next Tuesday".
So I'm gonna send the lamp back.
How do I best do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping about my #PRS_ORG.
Display: Ups, there was an error.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# page goes to the computer.
I updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anaesthetic.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing noises/voices, rarer to see pictures and most rarely to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: Kaiser cuts are operations that go with an increased rate of awareness, since to protect the child up to the time of cancellation, a very deep anesthesia is avoided.
Prior episodes of awareness should be mentioned during anesthesia interview.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check if they at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an e-mail that you did not answer.
Again the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver from the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order as I do not know any person who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not going to be calling?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He's profiled himself as a theater critic and an executive.
Later he wrote a monumental theater story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97 years.
There's the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The shaking diary of a slow farewell from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I have already witnessed my life's thought."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Europallets, standard wooden pallets, which are used mainly in Europe as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European pallet association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was close to 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually will not be collected
New York will get MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 season in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the Elfmeter shooting with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had asserted itself against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I've come to taste and want to cook roulades for the first time in New Year's Eve.
I'll set up a cattle fund tomorrow.
Do you have any tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get it
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18 January that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not been received from me.
I'd like you to check it out.
Where there are still Christmas breads in the room Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck are among the Christmas days such as the pine tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now the time is running short.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas bread in Lübeck's room.
The "Drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor class.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME rules, you can set the desired level and, on the other hand, the core content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-ruler with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
Furthermore, it was already suggested that the POWER LEVEL rule can even be used to make a reserve of power if it goes unashamedly loud.
POWER LEVEL rules allow the entire potential of the VT+ series to be used in any situation.
The headphones can also be used as a line output.
The signal in question is processed with a box simulation, so that when using a headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, allowing you to jam into your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you are spending an additional VFS5 footswitch, you can easily access the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effects blocks and tap the speed of the compatible effects associated with them.
This is really essential for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step into the future!
But I saw it with others that way.
Is there any way to send the lamp back to you?
Because she's hanging too low over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the dresser?
Do we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it's not possible, I'd be satisfied with a discount or a voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need are then a bit much.
I just got my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were planned as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement are progressing according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to discuss the topics on the agenda," said Iran's chief tradesman Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first there was no agreement on the issues to be dealt with.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had been continued after almost one week of interruption.
The negotiations include Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
There is also a US delegation in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now Germany with the highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence across Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal country, Thuringia has located at the Corona incidence on Sunday above the 1000 mark.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 severe Covid-19 sufferers were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health offices have been overburdened for weeks and hardly come after the collection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery is only in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick to the package and leave it at the post office, that was it?
I don't have to click or specify/fill anything here?
That's what I want to avoid. That's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a fright in my eyes.
It's time for change
###Bundestag be welcomed, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Where to the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the MBundestag, you can find one: it is not extreme.
We have come into a winter star and have expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, how some things have gone down here and how we are in general.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many here still have bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundestag, which wants to keep it alive.
The start came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found one, simply, clusters of sharps.
After writing down and writing down several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, but this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange one another, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How are we going to appear outside in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but it's not bad, that's what we've got the discord in the end.
If you have a desire and time, come to the discord, work together and let us democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clobious for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there those also in oversize, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty closet will be picked up soon.
And I'm asking you to let it go now.
I do not have suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up appointment.
Is there a manual for installation?
How long would I have time to get these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, at the moment probably also rarely eat meat.
I myself used to be a vegetarian for a few years.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and Vegetarianism was a planned step forward, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I am ultimately supporting animal torment.
Therefore my decision to vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she was showing disillusionment on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and was reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'plump' was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without which one would put it on.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not decouple from the legal requirements for distance marketing.
I am on the assigned date at which #PRS_ORG# my return does not pick up on site.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, this can't be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly again to be seen.
Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserstückung: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented an application decision of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been operating since November 2020, was EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us here," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diving squad Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a permanent record of increasing efforts: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read to 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOT works.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and I hope now for help.
Okay, here we go.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection in June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for first of all for putting up with the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we were also arms carriers in the executive, I do not want to go further!
I always find the question of right and links very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that the state servant of course comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the particular uniform and armor bearers people on the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course be difficult to deal with the living reality is also clear, because of course you have, besides the average white, in the meantime many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and therefore I don't mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because in the executive there are rather less than normal men and women who are not noticed if they don't tell you) and also on these people, and I have to rely on them, because in doubt they will save your life or put it in for you.
But even these marginal groups also represent even if my experience sounds strangely conservative, are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by excessive left politics, even if this policy is supposed to work for them or think it is right for them to do so, they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but these can openly say their opinion there or even openly forsaking any State-threatening plans is medialy exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it is also true that policemen and soldiers who were often employed abroad often start to pause due to negative experiences and even say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is also evident that right-minded people are certainly also involved in a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I believe that this is a good fight and I am also opposed to all of it with political education and education.
Germany is so very international and this is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I do not understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order that is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep hooks that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been doing one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure time), but for my whole life I get to run my household more badly than right permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when and then it picks me up and I clean up space.
But it's never so "that someone could come to visit spontaneously."
My husband isn't better either, but it bothers me somewhere but most of the time it just loses home against work and unhappiness.
The kitchen is still cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more decent with a child?
We have nothing yet to do, but we have no work to do, and I have been working on this question for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as there is no visit and, for example, always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows for an almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further imprinting on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on the arms and knees)
For the Focea Comfort 4 the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the surface covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (axles, arm and knees)
High quality preforms in the lower back area and in the step provide an approachable, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the lumbar spine increases flexibility around the back zipper and thereby improves the comfort, especially when bending and installing the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex zone around the shoulders and at the back is guaranteed increased flexibility in movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cooling protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head hood)
Soft zone, located in the collar, improves sealing with a finely adjustable wide adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not adhere to the casing or to the seams
Double cuffs with zipper on arms and ankles connect an enveloped inner cuff with a soft, chasquered Neoprene outer cuff
45° insertion at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and loadability on tightening.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal sliding and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (beechat patent)

Outer cuffs bordered for greater loadability
Cut-in edges of the inner cuffs for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially at deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I always see that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
This means that I have no self-esteem and, therefore, I am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on the business level, but I find it very difficult to talk and I was often told that I have worked inextricably (where I think this has already improved).
Can I be such a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, the search advice or family assistance.
But I do not know whether the concrete working day is really the way I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there's something wrong with my code ("the simplest things are going on again") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues to ask me to help ("I should now really know myself how this is going"/"I stop him with my stupid questions from working"/"she really has to think I'm being undermed" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it instead.
But did you keep the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
Waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do you mean, give it back?
When I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# does not authenticate this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed divides the bird into the individual proteins (aminoacids) in its gastrointestinal tract, and in turn builds up its own proteins, which it also needs to form a feather.
The formation of feathers in the nesting and the reproducing feathers in the muffining bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as there may otherwise be disturbances in the breeding course.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply should again be changed to NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A cut measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe femoral damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be administered at the beginning until the approach of respiration is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is reached until the regurgitation is complete.
Storage: NEKTON Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair go broken after 9 months ?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a municipal staff member in the recast on the Statute
Hello, R/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be found on our property.
So the case request was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for this.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany.
Can you check that out?
Eilmeldung: Severe traffic accident at Self
A serious traffic accident has recently occurred on St 2179 between the connection point Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm currently announces (14:03 pm), a car has arrived in reverse traffic while overtaking.
There are injured.
I get it.
Well, then thank you again so much that it went so easy!
Advice and ideas on further work life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is cutting everything you can think about.
Before I go out here .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cruiser.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in an area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I call nothing more precise).
But that was all too boring for me then and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the teaching office and I was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's only six months away.
I have always decided to continue the painting before and at least finish the Ref, after which I can still turn around.
But I'm done right now.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend and my evening party.
That's when I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now myself the family celebration is too much stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that excite me.
Basically it is fun and viewed from the outside the Ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely drained and wondering how much stress my body can bear before it's completely closed - if he doesn't already do that.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of your contributions here - or whether I should not go back to the old area, since where I was valued, I could take free time if I needed them, and found the work somehow boring, but adequately paid for it, and together in a team what worked out and not as a single fighter like that now is the most time of the case.
But then I wonder if I did not return to the same place in a year as now and was dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of wet, but maybe you've come out as an outside council or ideas, like me from this situation that I'm completely finished and just about the smallest thought of crying.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologies for the weeping undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronicx series has evolved steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" class, which perfectly mimics the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also naturally contain the multi-stage Valvetronicx tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances are just so bubbling.
With VOX's "tone room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with Modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which led anno 2010 again to a power boost of the VOX Valvetronicx series - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronicx series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists will find a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced display of game dynamics and string approach as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determined the tube character of a amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier fitted with a 12AX7 tube perfectly shapes the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually spaced and foldable velcro parts, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-other things.
Also drone pilots make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a period of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa in 1585 with 84 days.
There are no reliable data on past outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, but Vulcanologists still dared not predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the Island Council, RTVE.
Million-threshold Damage
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degree hot lava destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava that is thick in meters.
This corresponds to nearly 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
On the off coast, a cold lava created two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Heavy was particularly affected by the immensely important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in the crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 acres of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely damaged, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the celestial festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crushing tension somewhat seductive in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to French sociologists and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-making "society treaty of nature peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christian Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through which Christmas days were closely associated with the bribe.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on Nikolaus Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that as Bishop of Myra, Saint Nicholas threw three women secretly gold into her window one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional type of gift, the popular custom in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants encountered this custom because they rejected mediators between God and men as "Holy worship".
For these reasons, they remain against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from Nikolaus and established a new line of tradition.
With this, the focus of the gift shifted to the evening of the sanctuary.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only angers the least that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still a permanent part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to Martinsingen and Martin's move.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian - shaped countries, however, there is a joyful mess about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christian Child appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, which is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, to which some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white rausschebart, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian bar of the historical figure, his sled, drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who should have shown them the way to the child Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes fabulous creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought some fame.
Here they are not reindeer, but three horses who draw their sleds as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christian child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police announced that callers had reported a man who was supposed to go to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled according to the authorities in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
Shots had fallen and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police didn't leave a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light blends harmoniously into each bed, garden or stone garden.
The lamp is easily positioned and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth's spears.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 h.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly colored.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone makes this solar light shine fascinating – in white or colored light (in equal six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself at daytime.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also makes himself in the neighborhood of bigger pebbles and finders, where he knows how to claim thanks to his size.
Large preparations can save you: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require any supply or batteries.
Set the "lightstone" to any place that is seen by the sun during the day.
Two co-delivered earth's spears provide firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly inside, together with his battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dawning, "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically; in what color you decide yourself: you can choose just six attractive colors of light – besides daylight white.
The switch-off is also done automatically once the battery charge level has fallen to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins the next day from the front.
I've done that several times it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello, dearly beloved,
I hope I do everything right here, is actually my first post after a year reddit.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this because I have to take enough drugs through chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had received from my last approximately two year break from 0 to 100 explosive pimples and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but I was pretty stressed out and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two years of break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this.
Perfumes free and without gedöns is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend me.
Unfortunately, a woman doctor has not taken me so seriously and a skin doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, my dear skin is such a mess.
Had pre-bupertary severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale lumps and acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of chronic illness and have remained on the bottom of sugar, milk and low meat mixed food, because otherwise nothing worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is just the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere you don't want to go looking what else is wrong.
I already had all of her colleague semina, etc.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what has been answered to my concerns.
I always have to work in between and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, if I'd seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but there is it generally in large

110 kV earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legal.
The plan decision of the government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator now informed Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre earth cable will combine the Tann Umspannwerk in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning to a mast of the free line at Reut.

Ref: school plan (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems to schedule time-efficient my teaching in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped at all, so that in principle I can only use the tablet, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy s/w for free in school (which is annoying for the mind of the Earth).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors, and with me it actually stands every hour for itself.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe I can have an geography teacher how to work with the book time-efficiently.
I'd really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NAMEBER#.
I actually decided for a new #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to do the return as soon as possible.
Trade fears Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops only those who have been vaccinated or healed may be allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and regrets revenue breaks.
A possible solution he has also prepared.
The 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business from the point of view of the German Confederation of Commerce (HDE).
In the case of transactions involving items of non-daily need, revenue breaks would be regrettable, criticised Chief Executive of HDE Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey of HDE among 1,100 dealers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negative at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What actually should be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without floor," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Good run it only in the food retail trade as well as online.
The Association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief businessman.
"2G when shopping does not bring us further in the fight against pandemic," he stressed.
Current regulations deterred customers and required high staffing.
The ban on strips had to be approved nationwide, he asked.
Afterwards, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all shops with the received tape on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be carried out in the retail sector, as in the public transport sector in the case of the 3G rule (impacted, healed or tested).
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, also specialized in shopping malls, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies last stood without 2G at more than 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the revenues were around 90 percent.
These numbers will now be safe in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high human and administrative effort, the Center is trying to find and approve solutions.
This included the so-called tape solution, where "the visitors, for example, at a central point in the center can once provide their 2G ID and then, equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel, can enter undisturbed all shops". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that was tried to be cashed with a yellow filler.
That looks awful.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I proceed for return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities provides for the setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive.
The lamp creates a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can light large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-access locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a shining display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply occupied and finished by longer pressing one of the storage keys.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when the lamp is turned off, so that when the new switch on, the well-known situation is restored - very practical at the studio work when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility to operate with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have sufficient power - it's a battery tester equally built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top indicator, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp continuously with electricity over the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm case as connection to attach, so you can directly to your photo set.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted on both sides by means of fasteners.
It was noted that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a nail joint is included in the delivery.
Great is that which is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got the gift and she's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a huge comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series Sieglosen Hessen were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga-Pleite.
But then the SGE turned up, and in a good hour, over a full-grown start of the season struck the soul with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to every individual who was involved".
At the beginning, it looked after a new damper for the Frankfurter now ranked nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
The morals of his teammates were also emphasized by defenseman Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the square for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcrowded muscle injury.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a view to the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also looks good at the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all players have fit in December that all players are physically in a top-level constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but players also live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the turn of the year "at this level".
Next on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, there is an outing game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 hrs, Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order is returned?
Unfortunately, I would say that I will not be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women in front of quarter finals against Spain
Germany's handball women slammed after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty glances from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup round, the DHB selection was collected at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 viewers in Granollers and now has to go against Spanish hosts in the quarter final.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We have to deal with Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game for all of us to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for the semi-final entry, against the World Cup second of 2019 on next Tuesday, a significant increase must be made in order to keep alive the tender dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was Rebackspace Player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We must now look forward quickly."
From the front to the back not at the height
Unlike the previous five tournaments, the German team was not at the height.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 backlog after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented some parades from getting worse.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Greysels successfully closed a quick counterfight.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backspace player Mia Zschocke didn't see red because of a hard foul on her opponent.
But in the quarter finals, it can play a part again.
Only in the final phase of the first half time did the DHB selection come into play a little better and until the break at least on five gates.
The only quiet hope for a pick-up after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greeners sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-established opponent, who is one of the medallion candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to rise to a performance increase and went off the parquet as a clear loser.

Is that what they're doing?
The title suggests that I am an immunist in mobile vaccination teams where (as yet only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since they are soon ready for a large part of it, it is then partly continued in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects and also medical issues, if they are not related to a person (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is due to vaccination).
In my area of responsibility, the information about vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Coronaimpfvere regulation and no reasons for speaking against) is given by the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (I have never done before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have no "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but cannot carry out vaccinations (needing?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself.
Heavy "chindler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "chindler"?
With this dialectic word, sent by an amberger, the BR TV show "We in Bavaria" has provided for heavy thought.
But unlike in many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unscathed by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one "who has to go fast".
That, the people heard from the TV moderator, was totally wrong.
On which the man from Amberg communicated the solution, and so probably also with many upper piles caused amazement.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the oven."
Dielectric researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical obelisk term, derived somehow from the rather well-known word of mouth "Hodern".
What an educational gap was closed - probably also with some who have long lived in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy any books in two weeks.
After the confirmation the following error message always comes: opens -some winning wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, rebooted, connected, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
Nothing helped.
The choice of tires at the racing wheel - really so pan-proof?
This morning I woke up full of action because I still wanted to practice at least a little bit in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said I did, and I drove with my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km was also really nice - but then what happened in every city in the city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud swirling and my back tire didn't want to take the rest of the track with me anymore.
Because of the day of the week I had no real opportunity to get me replacement jacket and replacement hose, I had to turn around with half a bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad in the mood, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
But now I'm faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would get extremely anxious about this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, because even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I picked up the bike until 14.00 120km!) and who had already called it suboptimal because he had been on role with them for years.
But if I think that I have to make another tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad lucky :D
Now I got into the conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unflatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so incapacitable?
I don't want to spend a lot of money now, just to be disappointed.
I'm still wondering: I'm currently on the racing wheel I believe 25x622.
They are also available (seemingly?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a bike in general to have other tires?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute! Laying knowledge rather to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you very much in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car looped against tree: Driver fatally injured
On the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, the 53-year-old was beaten with his car for an unexplained cause against a central island and then came to the counter-road, as the police reported.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then tossed against a tree and put the man in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were severely injured during the accident and brought to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also get young again.
Solo 15 is the new sprayer and visually reminds of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design proposal, a suitable designed foot is included directly to raise the speaker to the correct audio position.
It has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but is to be achieved at an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was voted the SOLO 15 with a slight high pitch increase.
This is commonly used in broadband to optimize the excessive frequency of increasing bundling.
Precisely oriented on the listening spot, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone range can be reduced slightly to the outside and thus the sound can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the spotting of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM are the result of a fine dynamic that is looking for its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands them in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes during the construction process.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, you need to adapt the speaker's lowering system, as the veneer again carries material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), a 8 mm hole should first be drilled into the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable easily there later.
With the help of an overcrowd, the speaker's opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used unbundlingly.
This opening should be fitted with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase as shown in the 'Detail Phase' picture.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these, the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now lined up.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The spraying itself may vary in the thickness of the material if necessary, provided that, for example, you want to use finished moulds from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole circuit saw or aforstner drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection clamp on the back wall are facilitated.
Then you use a circular cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the base plate can also be rounded.
In addition, the base plate is glued firmly with the base of the housing and is screwed on with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the bolting points of the speaker chassis and the connector terminal.
After cleaning the housing of wood dust (exhale / blow out), one begins with the laying of the cable.
This is most easily achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncut cable is moved piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and makes it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing you lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it also hang out there loosely.
The frequency week is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency wave, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
When the frequency fold is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and thus lock.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can verify the seal accordingly.
Now the shock follows the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus cable (marked cable) must be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
A mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order even now and only have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that this year we will also be organizing the OSCAST again!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short-term duration of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so that we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we'll give everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get some drinks cold, plan good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
