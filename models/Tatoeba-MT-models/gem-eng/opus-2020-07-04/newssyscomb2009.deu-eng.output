Triumph of the legal populists in Austria, in total they reach 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the large coalition so far and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the preferred parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria after the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the go.
In contrast, the leader of the Austrian Alliance for the Future (BZÖ), the Kärntner State Chief Jörg Haider, prepares for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party, which had demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage before the SPÖ.
However, the voters have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party president and previous Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Head of the Party.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to renew the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) were initially given 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even led to sanctions on the part of the European Union.
This development obviously depends on Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party and will proceed from a return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also withdrew to Parliament, but suffered slight losses and collapsed among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent price and therefore did not move into Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India because of the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg may find a certain cooling down of Czech-India relations.
This was emphasized by the Minister of New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukhedshi.
"If this doesn't settle, then surely, then there will be a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executive could only be difficult to intervene.
In spite of all, he pointed out that, in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted from the charge and received a fine, the central government wanted the local government in Dardjiling, in which case-law fell the matter.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he went to a higher instance in appeal.
He could thus seek the release of bail and wait for his judgment in freedom, says the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed a similar opinion during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he would be in favour of it," said the Chef of Czech Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted "competent legal support", led the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help is already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," Schwarzenberg pointed out.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, he confirmed the Czech Republic's importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
One answer to the question whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter was lost by the ministers.
"I was already quite promised," he simply stated.
A Czech directs over the ringing around the sea floor
It appears on an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are depicted.
However, it is not interested in the continent, but rather a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island is part of Australia and together with it is also the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself," according to Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty staff members of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it.
This is where the work force and enthusiasm prevail.
So far, the seabed has a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, further ore and other non-regrowing raw materials, but also so far unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the countries bordering the coasts were vehemently aware of their entitlement to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they avail themselves of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply expressed as a continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the shores, often also the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," says Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country of the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be verified by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated over five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three last-named countries have been successful," Mikulka adds.
An international echo recently hit the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly enlarge its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was granted to the country last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in investigations.
The profit that will flow to them from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Agreement of Montego Bay".
Where the continental Shelf ends, the region of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as a "joint heritage of humanity", begins.
There is no longer a special position here.
The right to promote in this area shall be granted to an international institution set up by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold graveland," says director Mikulka, adding, "whose individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was given the status of a so-called "road-breaking investor" because of the convention in 1991, as did the investors of some of the other countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"Promoting can be done on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concentrates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concrete form as a pattern.
It reminds you of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary shame that the legend has brought to life after the golem.
German special forces were on-site in the case of hostage relief
The Egyptian government had called for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they didn't get used.
European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming increasingly familiar with the circumstances of the liberation of eleven.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists in the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9 were the pilot squad of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Agency at the place of liberation.
However, the German forces were not needed, as ministers spoke further on Monday evening, because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support workers.
"Unfortunately, it has not come," said a spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The group of attackers had abducted the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on 19 September.
After abduction in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were dragged to and from the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
Until recently, the identity of the hostages remained unclear as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The saviors have arrived in Cairo in the meantime.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "image" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be evacuated with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Packages
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed the 700 billion dollars rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones ran into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all appeals made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program with which the chaos should be curbed in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Mr Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to give their consent, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones broke by more than six percent or by 600 points.
There were concerns from investors that the government rescue package might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
For the programme to enter into force, the consent of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers report increasing booking figures
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, revenues have risen significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic outlook, the Germans' desire for travel remains a study.
During the winter season bookings, rice agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the market research institute GfK, booking figures have already been increased for autumn months.
Thus, the sales increase of travel agents for October amounted to around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV announced.
The basis for these results is figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates high for the overall market.
The travel bookings were recorded by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, especially travel to the US was required, the DRV announced.
Here you can find about a third of the booking increase.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic fillets of the Germans are particularly popular destinations.
In particular, holiday trips would be high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing cost of energy and food, the costs "for customers are better calculable than for individually organised holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early-book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that compared to the previous year there would have been an increase in sales again - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time Octoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-ski hits in the endless loop, beer made of liters and celebrities in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blond, TV moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
One thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, already the photographers fall on us and cut the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White Wurstquartor, the well-being in the trachea has remained limited to date.
But once upon a time on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks offended or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange views at the chocolate stand only harvest my dirndlschürze.
A monk reminds me that I would have incorrectly tied the apron: "Leftmost free, middle virgin, right forgiven, wetted back."
Secretly, I free myself the loop from back to left.
"Pass," said and laughed.
Others make less effort to make subtle flirting techniques and wear simple blankets, on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretchs an unsolicited the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October Festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgous", with a long-drawn "oooo".
He tells me this after he's done away with his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage dump.
So Bob is one of those notorious "Wildbieslers".
Others do not have the happiness of getting rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, nurses in Sharen run over the square that needs to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the rubble - always four at once drag a covered carrying from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: Empty back, full back.
You can't see who's under the plane in the Promille-Sarg.
"These are the ones whose gardeners pack," one of the medics called me on request and disappeared in the mess.
Name of the victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, residing at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspicious driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey's intention to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platform with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building breaks down for example
But if you are once within the vaulted ticket office, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost access it was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad company.
Germany, which was a late-goer in the imperialist game, had to implement before its ambitions, dominate the Middle East, by means of a train to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist project paralysed during World War I.
His railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917 a munitions train flew into the air, with the artificial roof destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, passing far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling judicial and development party, the ACP, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the key dates of this new foreign policy, I climbed the night train into the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts from the ACP, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state project, the Ottoman past to return.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main office of the AKP, a specially crafted, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by half completed shopping centers and pubs in which middle managers in suits, both men and women met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exceptional occurrence," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, it must look to the East and the West at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could someday," I asked, "forced to decide?"
" Turkey," he said, "wouldn't have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone, with whom I spoke here, said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only towards the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be able, in the sense of transfer, to drive Europe as a whole on straight railway tracks east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpashas station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry station to take me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called the "sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and stood alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never failed for years.
How often did we die "to let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never mastery, but never superfluous.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal humility.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply "go home in the world with one or two well-known poachers."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your appeal for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while studying for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate at the same time.
This is a conclusion from a comment from the authors in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 under a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
He left Nottingham in 1953 and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life', because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November Honda won the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large space limo offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical refinements that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel saving.
Changes ahead of the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this wholesale business are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales on other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, approximately one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expects to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models a year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model enables you to cover the sales cuts in Spain.
In reality, the head of the brand hopes to complete the year with a total sale of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain from the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the emergence of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200 000 models per year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The release of the Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimetres) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with increasing dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due on the one hand to the new space flexibility program and on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in Jazz's predecessor model.
Also the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading surface, reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre gasoline engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-liter gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only having 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 models of petrol engines: 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both versions have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time produces torque-strong power for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves 90 hp power at 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp at the previous generation, he now creates 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more specifically, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the noise behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co technical development center developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuriro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight compartment, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the facet eyes of the bees, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which enables them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to imitate the overall perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance up to the object and sends a signal to a broth-like microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a signal for avoiding collision.
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid collision.
The greatest difference to any other system is that this evasive maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If this were not the case, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyauki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the managing engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can't deviate up or down, but also not over the top; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not into the infinite directions and in the infinite way that it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to prevent the small robot from colliding.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers carried out, so it can continuously work with just a few dozen KBs of the disk space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the disk.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan introduces in the next ten years in the series cars prophecy time.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than the variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the goal of driving and avoiding obstacles along the way.
It is trembling before it is burdened with a mortgage.
One must realize that the US Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid that the US citizens are involved in mortgage stories of supposedly affordable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’, it says.
Or maybe, the 'Hotel of Bad Credits' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly she has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is extended?
Well, when a dreamy room in the hotel appears.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley makes her capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, with which this would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take on 21% of its capital, a innovation due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley stock at the uniform price of 25.25 dollars, resulting in a total amount of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the share price from 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be sold back at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley stock, however, dropped by 6.79% around 17.00 GMT to 23.07 dollars.
'This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which should enable him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest name to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the last days: last Monday Morgan had simply declared that she would sell up to 20% of its shares for approximately 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
`A week ago', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, we thought that the participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% for its Morgan Stanley shares below its price value.
And the business will go with a reduction of profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year if the latter is exchanged over the value of more than 50% within a given period, i.e. to approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds delivered by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group press officer refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a solvency rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August, his balance sheet has been significantly reduced.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their stock exchange price dropped by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity for payment accelerated.
This price went down on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other survivors of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly cancelled at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refound the Republic around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorialer Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who this Sunday, followed the example of his like-minded and friends, who chose the plan of a new constitution.
According to the public results of 80% of voters, 64% voted in favour of 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be reached.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polling stations and a narrative of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and 63% to 70% prophesied to him.
On the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, called for the victory of his constitutional project.
`Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, insured and congratulated the equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bacheloret.
The election held in silence in accordance with the Observatory of the Organization of American States (OAS) referred to a 444-point text on the safeguarding of 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the oil promotion by foreign companies and the foreign currencies who send the foreign residents to the country.
The project, driven by the 2006 Correa, will also give the Head of State greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to disband the National Assembly.
Correa announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial base as a source station for American anti-drugs operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital, healthy and undamaged, this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released from Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages on board a special aircraft reached the military base of al-Maza right next to Cairo's international airport at around 3.30 p.m.
They were brought on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, without being able to speak to the press.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'were not paid any ransom', said the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the roll field.
On 19 September, after being captured at an off-road truck safari at the foot of the Ouanat mountain in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought from 35 unknown kidnappers from a hiding place to the next.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the Agency Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from aboard two helicopters, started the attack at night, shortly before dawn.
'On both sides shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled', said this responsible person, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support through German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is, about the role, secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must acknowledge that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units', he explained without further detail.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in which the kidnappers were located, six of whom, including the leader of Chad, killed and two arrests.
The army explained that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which, however, immediately contested this movement.
letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will rise and denounce the pitiful sums that will be granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve lamentably?
Which politicians dare to remind the federal government that they neglect their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no proper laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government alone provides 3.5 million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours are written in the constitution of their country that protecting the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government communities, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 honorary officials gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives with a few frogs, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guardian dogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when sponsors and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries are trying to get under the burden of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three countries provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
In the sense of the decision made on Sunday night, all three countries buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell part of its shareholdings, first of all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep valley trip last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already emerging.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too large for a pleite.
The Institute's securities fell to 14-year-olds on Friday by 12%.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the Group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to management.
In the view of management, the USD 700 billion cost-effective American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets is due to the tacking of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director-General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find itself interested in a factual offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor is supposed to shiver for his money, it was said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been stunned.
In Hungary the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in chicken stall
Because of the drug use of a person, life and health insurance in America often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the Fuchs chickens" - quoted Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurances determine the fees and payment amounts in the event of damage, depending on the customer's health status, and if the risk is assessed too high, the insurance will not be completed.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more favourable method: On the basis of the customer's identification number, he uses the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, which preparations have been purchased, and the program calculates from what disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically turn him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurances only have to do the paperwork anymore, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and heat waves, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurers’ point of view, while the above is not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed which, before receiving the data, ask the patient for his consent.
Meanwhile, they have to do this by law, although omissions have not yet been made.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and connect them with the data on drug use. Thus they provide an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal data protection law on health data, its effect is limited to health care providers and insurance providers.
The draft law has already been presented to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly deny access to his data, as otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens have been left quite somehow the grace of the fox.
Global menu from Marseilles
European Union and India double trade
After both the European Union and India are the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue, in addition to other global problems, at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-India Summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power, which should be given more votes and participation in international affairs, Member States have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of the UN Security Council, or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the 9th Marseille Summit.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to a maximum of EUR 100 billion.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that in future air traffic will also be flown.
India wishes to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to establish a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's partner number, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which were strongly condemned by both sides, and the convening of a UN conference was also called for.
The Doha round should also be completed, both sides being indebted to failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as with the proposal to conclude a global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the issue of financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement at a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that orders from French companies worth EUR 20 billion will be made for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
The Agency reports indicate that the Agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits the current event of 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will distribute over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The sub-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony at the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented at the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed around publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is diminishing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The small aircraft of the billionaire Steve Fossett disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's small aircraft, which disappeared billionaire on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was discovered.
The individual parts were found on a 3000 m altitude plateau, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully denied the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a troops were sent. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the aircraft or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that a crew was sent out just a few hours after the aircraft sighting, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab that was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett was launched in Yerington in Nevada for a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two ID cards with the name of Fossets, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long succession of records.
In 2002, he was able to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon in the sixth run: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew the world into a single flight without a stopover with an airplane.
Among his several records is also a flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ads you don't expect
A Suv that falls from the traditional schemata through its original design and the special liner, the inviting surface and its clear angle.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breaths into the sector with this off-roader.
Due to its exceptional properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from 17 October onwards.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the emergence of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, i.e. in the form of a 3D campaign – this will be a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take on the central shopping mile of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear as a three-dimensional model in its almost real dimensions.
In fact, the car will appear so seemingly from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its details to reassemble itself as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes's concern with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of copyright into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it succeed to attract the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The conveyors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia hit these in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 Italian fans had been made available for the game: all were on display on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, all of them were controlled by the Viminal: under which after Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already under pressure in this respect, were denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for reports from the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans won't put a foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation cities, which could follow it little more than 150.
"This fire needs to be left immediately, and in no case give such behaviour the possibility of justification," it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "Eyes to above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Apulia there is a small nucleus of Italian ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sport supervisor) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, that is, the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (explained with no joy) who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over Francensco Tagliente's post and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now comes a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are committed in the country of their deed.
So far, this group had held in the brink, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we are also talking about the whistles during the hymn mamelis: even this is not a crime, but allow me to do so, since the education is lacking...".
