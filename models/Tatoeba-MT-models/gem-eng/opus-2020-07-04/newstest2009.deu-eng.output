The Prague Stock Exchange falls into the mine against business closure.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange started at the beginning of Tuesday's business on Monday when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time there was the reason for the burglary on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
The case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost nearly four percentage points during the business day, but was able to offset some of the losses later, reducing to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Stock Exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," says the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, decides its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
The American legislators should, as the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said, return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support of the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a threat that other countries would also be affected by the burglary.
A bloodbath of American stocks
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan for supporting the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would regulate the basic causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break-in was recorded last in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not come through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concessions: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
In talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the American financial system, the US legislators reached a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
The Congress Members have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee said this to Barney Frank of Reuters.
According to the Senate, different information could probably be agreed on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be an "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our differing views on what a package for stabilising the market should look like," said the agency Bloomberg, Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
According to their words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with American finance minister Henry Paulson on Sunday at night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a divestment of unsolicited mortgage assets from financial companies that plunge financial firms into serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the brink of a definite agreement on a plan which will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the finish line," says Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis also has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators sought to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is to reassure investors before business on Asian financial markets, which lie in the first time zone where a Congress decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, also there is a lack of clarity as to whether the negotiations could not fail in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be prepared as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
The congress, however, can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote against his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained, based on the acquisition of funds for the purchase of poor mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress was also satisfactory by the American President Bush.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of concessions and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law will also restrict the so-called gold parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to monitor the fund.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages that it buys up, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
According to Patria Finance David Marek's main economist, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why, because you don't know which mechanism and price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," said Marek this week to the server iHNed.cz.
According to Marek, whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive.
"A lot more important is that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they will adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on adopting it is at this moment the most important thing," said Marek.
Duel on Messer's cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
In spite of all, there are enough reasons why you should become an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Sure, it's hard to buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably at least dream of such a one.
So it is also with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music, simplified expressed - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink-Floyd fan will hardly be able to use headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The life span of batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even make any hints.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the simsen, it can display music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no television photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music longer than ten or twelve hours, it is usually much less.
Music players (especially the simplest) are much more powerful in this respect.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you make occasional calls, you better buy yourself a charger for your office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a one-time charging off.
Another problem then is if you want to overplay the music on the mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, as well, it is not possible to connect any mobile phone without special software directly to a PC.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a memory medium, but only a few card readers will complete without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
In the case of players, you do not need special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves set up a music library, arranged by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should check the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, the comfort of the operation.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and you only hear it in the tram for example every day, then any phone that plays MP3 files is sufficient.
Which really can almost any phone.
You don't have to check specifically which music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 creates everyone, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most of the devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the respective pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself as to why a music hand should be placed.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is bad and is usually limited only to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (it is via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone carries most of them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless free-of-charge device.
If not, you can get back to the integrated speaker, which has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music handiwork will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three thousand and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player, in turn, lies in easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really operate anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity when operating with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an irregularly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrifying bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you grab now
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
Keep your eyes open.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy yourself a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of operation comes to that of a single MP3 player.
The most important thing is here is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) offer MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile communications market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting for long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile operators are working on the most expensive in Europe.
Incidentally, this also confirmed the Telecommunication Authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of a text here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradox - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How come prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight argument.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, are happy to see that there is an enormous amount of competition in the Czech market.
The Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) President, Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another supplier in the Czech Republic, is often obliged to do so.
It is true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a special number of chances (by the way, it would probably find hardly any frequencies).
But there is one more way - a virtual provider.
In particular, the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market resulted in a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile operators had to react to.
There were similar voices in the UK before such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market in the Czech Republic.
But it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't need to look for examples for a long time.
In February we reported about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus ascended to the country's fifth largest supplier.
Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profil themselves as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a very good chess move to a non-clinic target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar approach could be taken in the Czech Republic as well.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the services offered."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, President of the Penta Financial Group, will be entering the market in other countries of our region."
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly prone to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do all they can to ensure that no potential competitor emerges.
For some time now, their interest in launching a virtual mobile network provider has been showing the group GTS Novera, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we were already able to achieve negotiations progress," said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a fully-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market has great specificities vis-à-vis other markets.
So far no subject has yet addressed us with a complex and serious project in this field," says his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Other providers also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Press Speaker Martina Kemrová adds in rare accordance with the O2 statement: "Until now, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile, hardly a virtual provider will appear until the end of the year.
At this moment we should have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we consider to be the best from the customers' point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The way mobile operators operate is easy to understand, another provider was called more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thereby to a decline in profits.
So why should one make market entry easier for such a competitor?
The fact that suppliers can pull a string when it comes to something, also the long way around the origin of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the time when U:fon came onto the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also proves the publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile communications market was also recently strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile service provider.
Given the nature of the mobile communications market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services would impose high requirements."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities surprises.
This is not just the position of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately - unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - has no competence to intervene in economic competition.
It only owns the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, refers to this whole problem of its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential prospective customers was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa in his reply to our request from the department of external relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by suppliers' representatives.
This is more than worrying from an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreigners, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and price reduction are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
Indeed shocking in this case is the almost already touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same fuel price at the petrol stations is surely only coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"In this case, the Authority has not discovered any signs of action directed against competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so it does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its market behaviour.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," explained Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators will have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile service provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you don't go along with this argument, it should be a warning for the ÚOHS at least that three mobile operators are acting similarly.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) prove that they face very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The shifting of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has been observed in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent amendment of the Telecommunications Act, it has not been possible to enforce the extension of ČTÚ's competences in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one's looking.
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several equal numbers in the Czech mobile networks, remains disregarded.
There are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
Normally these are companies that act in the field of multi-level marketing.
Private mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selection.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classical company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile communications providers prohibit similar types of resale.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal with what might lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding society," answered Martina Kemrová on our question on this issue.
It is quite unlikely, however, that this is not the case with those responsible for the mobile service providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In fact, from the activities of these companies they are not subject to negligible profits, at the same time they are not affected by the actual official marketing, unlike the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculation, despite all that, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
Furthermore, they must accept that the SIM card does not run on their name on their phone, so they cannot have full value of it as the normal customers of mobile operators."
The ČTU should at least seem strange to the ČTÚ alone.
A further question for the ÚOHS is also raised.
The mobile operators close their eyes before such a procedure, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It is added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the provider's statement, they did not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When Czech Republic Is Not the Most Tallest
As already stated in the text several times, the market entry of virtual suppliers resulted in a significant price decrease in the various services.
Practically in all countries, where virtual suppliers have emerged, the classic suppliers have tried to prevent their origin from occurring virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a market too small or too much saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies were taking action at these moments, not trying to safeguard the interests of mobile operators, but rather their customers.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator was born, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot escape the impression that in these cases ambiguity in the competences is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the flange into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider is soon to appear, the Czech mobile communications market may be moving again soon.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will then no longer be making more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best ones
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Anthem on the occasion of the day of Czech statehood.Where is my home country?
The hymn was replayed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo song, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocals took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The hymn version editors are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the server iHNed.cz.
For Bělohlávek the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo versions, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to keep a clear section so that you can understand the text well so that it can be consistent," said the conductor.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was recorded for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Standetheater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, which was played by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the development of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven State symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound
The Prague transport companies transport on Wednesday for the first time also on a chip
Wednesday, October 1st, 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport operations as a date on which the first passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus carrying an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
The passengers can buy a 30-day ticket, a 90-day ticket or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it recorded on their chip card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the traffic stations at the Muzeum metro stations, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday, the coupons have also been available via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper licenses.
You buy the Coupon over the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"There is also a switch with trained staff available at these locations, which advises interested parties on the purchase of the Internet and also puts the coupon on the map," said the project's spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play electronic coupons on self-service machines on the opencard, which are mounted in some underground vesicles.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remember to be lighter, the passengers may have already noticed in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"At present there are five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow on is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohemian region came to the capital.
"In the trains that belong to the Prague integrated traffic, the train attendants have readers with whom they can check the validity of the coupons after time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization the ticket control. This organization compiles the timetables for Prague's transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout at the driver's office.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked position on the side of the ticket.
The driver thus controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver to ask for this information," Drápal says.
A passenger who does not drive with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can, in turn, go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
The information on the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the USA
The Sudeten Germans had in 1945 requested the integration of the Bohemian Forest into the United States.
This comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans should have turned to the US presidents in 1945.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive that is now kept in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberator," says a letter that is signed with the words "people who are at the heart of the fate of the seditions".
As the follow-up to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, lack of consideration, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state that oppresses and eliminates minorities and has not at all contributed to the victory of the Allies," is to read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is said to be the fear of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient for him to initiate a referendum in Bohemia on whether the inhabitants would become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of the post-war history, in the opinion of some witnesses of the times it is a good picture of the Sudeten German expectations at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had at least to know that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the South.
Still others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
In the war, he served as a German Budweiser at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he was imprisoned at the end of the war and brought him to a war prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed if they came home, the Czech would come to suit them," says Chalupa.
No one of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war assumed that they would expel him from the Republic on the basis of Beneš decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotional campaign aimed at drivers
The most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
The emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday, could also be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš żebíček promises to put drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to reduce drivers from too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind them to get dressed before they arrive.
The campaign mainly wants to talk young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers into the conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also bears witness to this:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a label.
And in a blood laugh, the word is "pay".
This means that one can pay a moment of inattentiveness with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normal pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It promises that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths will fall on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for drivers
"The driver's motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when driving red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", said the traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, even less effective are tables that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. Jordanland, East Jerusalem and the Golan highs, if peace with Palestine and Syria could be concluded in exchange for this.
He emphasized this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Acronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to drop to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozer to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has done, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in reference to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Premier's words, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the templeberries and sacred and historical places" located in the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Extract from the Golan Heights
Olmert spoke out for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to refrain from getting back the Golan hills.
They will have to refrain from their present relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship to (shitic) Hisbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they give to the terrorism of (shitic) Hamas movement, the terror network Al-Khaida and jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister put it.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus the bypass is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus from the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether Stewards and travelers are allowed to go on and on the bus during the journey.
"If we wish to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Transport Act", said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old Stewardes last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the road.
The young woman sat at this moment to all the unhappiness next to the driver, on which least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or a sharp brake in which the Steward coffee or newspapers carry out.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces.
If this is not provided in the bus, travellers must sit down.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places; which was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura, in contrast to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not at first agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus, according to which travellers may go to the toilet during their journey if they have their seat," he told him.
The law doesn't know any Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the concept of vehicle attendants, but its rights and obligations do not define it," adds the Ministerial spokesman Hanselka.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem in retrospect.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing positions in the product authorisation.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buss are divided into city buses, where there are standing spaces and the maximum speed is limited, city buses with parking spaces and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing spaces with maximum permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the aircraft, says the expert
The BESIP specialist for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid mode, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it is not certain when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can hit his head."
"However, if a bus is sharp, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and he also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the Director does not consider her profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the career of Steward is risky, I will strike him.
Coffee and newspapers can get travelers on board.
It would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asia Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his buses. His company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have Stewardesses, but from the beginning we fight.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not said a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had failed, who had worked for society for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the stand without flashing and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
That the two places for the Stewards had been sold, Jančura contests.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck driver.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the court judgment, but will also expect financial compensation from the debtor.
A law change?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of Steward's movement on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation in which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Also, buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the road," says Prof. Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewards to be a major threat to passengers' safety," says Hanzelka, where the control of the safety of buses lies in the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf Hopes Rest in Frankfurt
In large words, the letter from the WestLB board to the staff of the house is not missing.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Geldsinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could arise, it is stated in the letter announced on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "block of competence" with sustainable yields into such a business.
And at all events, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further alliances in the state banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Services Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian Government has only recently made clear, the time has come to find a solution for the future.
From a link between the Deka bank and the savings banks because of their investment funds, as always, and the WestLB has been the talker for some time now - also on Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chairman Franz Waas had told us at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no point.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is held by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has instructed the Management Board to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just started, so it is said at the financial centre.
From the Deka bank, which is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre with its 3000 employees, it is not the first time that we talk about consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked like a moment ago when the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing became out of this tricycle.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the Hessian government opposed the participation of Helaba in it.
The other two houses did not find one another.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Palatinate went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have been constant reflections about a link between the Deka bank and state banks.
Last, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, spoke against planning games about a relationship with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to mature that a merger of the different houses of the public-law sector is needed.
After the Landtag elections in Bavaria have passed, the first thing to do is to get closer to a link between the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily a good news for the Helaba.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, you will gradually go out for it by the partners.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far been able to cope with the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the savings bank and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which participates with 85 percent in the Helaba, put forward a bar at the beginning of the year.
At least the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl, the decisive question of which business model would ensure the future viability of the Landesbanks, had not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkasses- und Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be destroyed, but it is not intended for itself.
So, in the letter from the board of directors there, there is also the question of a "total solution" for the house in any case.
How this can be put under a hat with the merging of individual units with the Deca bank will still show.
The second weekend of the Wiesnweek is known as the "Italy Week"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca already for the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his friend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearder and proves to the approximately 200 oktoberfest-reisende, which deep tones can produce its throat.
Elena's giving Luca a break, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the station Puorta Nuova, start four buses this evening at 23.45 o'clock, "destinazione Monaco, Festa della birra", expected to arrive at 6.30 o'clock.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, travelling in a bus exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they have celebrated already at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with furzimitat lining and glasses with wide silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours are alone this year.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 10:30.
Tonight, only unnecessary food would mean, says Marco.
75 Euros costs the journey, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian purity offer, health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll to the night, on the Autostrada direction "Breennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian signs on the 8 motorway will take another break just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at about 7:30 a.m. on schedule in the early morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco makes a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put the yellow cup on.
On the left there is "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, next to Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersivaviggiando.it".
Second, when the doors go up to the beer tent, it is said to run!, Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" run and occupy the squares in the rear part of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we're blocking, and not distributing all the yellow caps on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget a tip.
"Safety shows that we behave well!
As soon as you leave places, they'll be gone!"
Third: "This evening, half past eleven, find here again!" Understand?
And we're going to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as roadmarks to the trees, signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be ready for the retreat.
It is the second week of the week, known as "the weekend of the Italian week".
There is no precise information about numbers; the speech is from 50 000 who make their way across the Alps and fall into the beer fields, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to have come extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system was relatively stable, stressed Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good it was that the politician used the word "relative" and that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis developments.
Because it has now arrived on the weekend.
The property financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in Dax receives billions of credit from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to interest the part it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the government financier had financed extremely quickly - which is no longer possible because of market distrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year, the proceeds from amortisations to receivables and certain securities and from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only by means of higher returns from the reimbursement of reimbursable expenses from the restructuring of the former Defpa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest on the basis of the tax rules and the business services of group companies, had the net profit of around 16 percent remained moderate.
The former state financier had first speculated after his privatisation in 1990 with commercial real estate loans, which had then been distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of quality in classical state funding, the Defpa had then stepped up in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
To the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "essential material effect" on the Group's profit and loss account, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is, the dividend has been deleted.
She had already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financier since the takeover of Defpa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on the refinancing on the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks is largely shut down, as the banks are in a state of liquidity.
The Mortgage Real Estate needs a part - around 50 billion euros - of the credit portfolio of the Defpa for short-term refinancing.
Following the announcement of the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the credit for a foreseeable period of time and the company is shielded "from the impact of the currently largely inoperable international money markets".
From other sources it should be noted that thanks to the funds the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
In contrast, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer need to use money markets in the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This stands to hope for shareholders and creditors of the Bank.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that funding should not be used to the full.
But the opposite is not to be ruled out.
After the hearing after the bank was still before insolvency on the late Sunday evening, even the least temporary rescue can not soothe the minds.
The share price amounts to 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond rates, on the other hand, are quite good.
While priority debt hardly shows any movement, the rates of subordinated bonds are more pronounced.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected and understandably the maturity beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds once again have a speculative investment alternative, their worth must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the marked tightening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the Deppa crisis.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-off commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a temporary termination of pensions can be expected.
Or it will come as a surprise that the financial crisis will be overcome over the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports of sub-nationalisation, there is currently only a legitimate hope from the likelihood that there will be security.
This should, above all, allow long-term believers some sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
In any event, short-term investors may use a closing margin to make a return on the future remuneration tax payments for later price gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16th is to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls begin to geek: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from mangas - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Already before school I had bammel.
I live on Rand Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way by myself. Luckily, I didn't run away.
The start of teaching does not seem to be as strict at the tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students cheat in from eight o'clock until about twenty o'clock a short meeting with the teacher, the 'home room' begins.
But before the class began, I was in line to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I've put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At the moment, I was very glad that I had started learning the language just two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all cheated, whipped and waned and I have always heard the word "kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'fine, sweet'.
Then I quickly got stuck in my place.
The girl next to me was very broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was really upset.
Everyone talked and giggled and asked me holes in the belly - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of them unpacked their Bentos.
My guest mother had made me such a lunch box - that's something different than the desert German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Mostly I don't have a pale shimmer, what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It says everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, Brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then creates especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the break.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm just wondering if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said then:
"Because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I have been reading mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a faible for tradition, customs and customs.
And you put great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is organized so well, I have not felt lost here either, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in case of danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check whether they feel the same way if they behave the same way we do?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has published contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, where we can't even prove that other people are conscious.
But in this case we can at least hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of the feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, some scientists conclude on a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in the short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region has been developed in man much higher than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic is the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his life is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably differed greatly from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analysed on the basis of our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens when studying about the short-term memory of primates, especially at the example of visualization.
But in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasises the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I remind them that an emotional system like that will activate fear in one of his own activities conscious brains.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain-located defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
In this respect, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and in particular the people.
Associated with the linguistic nature, fine segregations of feeling arise because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to ascribe them to ourselves and others.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could have been involved in cross-portal sensations.
I cannot contradict it purely theoretically, but I think it is inconceivable.
Pankseep argues what appears to be fear in rats and humans, it is likely that in both cases too: how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same if they behave similarly?
A sheep flees when it is in danger whether it is also afraid?
In my eyes, mere behavior is not yet equal to life.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, but sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to people, how would you prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have sensations.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from those of us (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior of rats as the emotional sensations of rats.
Any progress here at the neural level is wavering, provided that the same is true of rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You may think this is shortsighted, but I prefer to advance rather than constantly walk against a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or conversion of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
The number of EM-Stadies may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian president Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
In the last season alone, several first-class players were sentenced to forced exit due to manipulation, and eventually even the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Assault Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and now has an issue with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her lost Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He's foaming and hitting back.
Late Rosenkrieg at the ex-Ehepar Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now carry out an unsightly fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had said for the first time about the reason for the divorce: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has only brought them to fruition after divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Indecent" was it, said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "For repeated times, Meg chews and rethinks the history of our relationship".
It would also be "regrettable" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "remembered publicly of the pain and upheavals that mean divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became father of Zwillingen.
And so close his registrations with the side-to-side: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Reduce prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant collapse in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, the nights spent in many places have already been discounted.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious was the trend in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
For this reason, American Express sees the weak dollar price that has led to a "reducing desire for travel by American tourists".
Also, financial sites such as Frankfurt or London were more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed upward trends in air fares:
As a result of the fuel conversion, passengers in the economy class on average had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, driving-intensive long-haul flights were even more expensive than 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices for economic class flights fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices were even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the reason for price collapse is the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is brumbling.
On the other hand, the open-skie agreement, which liberalises air transport between the US and Europe, gives rise to increased competition pressure.
In the case of airlines, the cancellation of unprofitable routes and the high number of airlines that had applied for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 were in Europe alone 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table guide.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a functioning Elf.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only got into the game late and failed with a lever to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, and she convinced him of the lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
Much wasn't going on in the catacombs, the half-time break had ended and most sat back on their seats.
Rieger was a Physiotherapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than many of the actors who have lost.
And so his request also found hearing in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
Its command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation has not been carried out.
"There wasn't everything beautiful to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it more relaxed.
The 1:0 (1:0) owes the Hamburgers the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which proved their club to be class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to arrange this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the table-based intermediate product is more likely to account for the incalculability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late engagements - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen who had been rejected by FC Bayern - finds it slow, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," demanded Jol.
After the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily break in for about 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer recorded more than five percent in the minus at 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.
The biggest loser was at the Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs yielded almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett was involved in the company.
The rescue plan is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid for a single blow, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive share option certificates from financial companies that could be redeemed in the course development in order to reduce the burden on the state funds.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downwards
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the USA do not address investors' doubts.
The share price of the German Grossbank Hypo Real Estate is falling and tearing down the Dax.
The US index Dow Jones is losing through the state despite the planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have broken the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The share of the Munich property funder lost at times three quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank reported more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000 point mark and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets went to their knees all over the world.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollar rescue package could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back into recovery.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could follow on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially yielded 3.2 percent, and CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese control index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 counters after initial gain.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index jumped by 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, Sensex lost 506,43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595,75 counters.
In the MDax, Arcandor shares surrendered after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private Bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook are not sold.
Dark matter influences flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has been causing infidelity: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be quite right.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of fuel lines that soon freeze, you are now threatening the cold.
Among scientists, for years a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been wondering for years: the missiles do not behave 100 percent the way they would expect under the old-fashioned gravitational law.
Instead, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him, Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that maybe even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronomers have formed in the universe.
"Desponsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space scientists have only known about the existence of the dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark matter makes up well one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
In Egypt kidnapped tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the tourists in Egypt should be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded several million euros of ransom.
Six hostages are said to have been killed in a shooting before release.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Redemption negotiations are already under way.
Germans always come to the sight of kidnappers again and again.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reflected in Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release of Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We're just checking her state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well aware and in security, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
Unclearly, the backgrounds of a shooting continue before the hostages were released: Thus, according to an Egyptian security officer, the abductors were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army suddenly killed six of the abductors.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in appeal to a German mediator who delayed the release of the hostages because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the stepfather "produced suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman's death, a court was reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro found out that he regularly held his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Ms. Randle died in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, at the age of 34 on 1 April 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise bound her eyes and bound her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife got divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court found that Ms. Randle, who was a volunteer for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted by abuse that had been added to her two times a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and had given up her life.
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she has killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession, saying, "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been frightening for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unfortunate story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still, the fact is that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, as described by Stephanie's father and mother, her actions over the years had on her daughter.
She would otherwise have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data shall be charged:
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official who lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June will be charged with the "Public Security Act".
The man was retired from the Department of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be an internal issue with the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be accused in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor's Office recommended that the officer be accused by the Metropolitan Police on account of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he presented included classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing construction companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could be at home after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are granted.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime will be charged each year to those 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies are included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved carefully ... are now called upon to take on some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold and that companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies must obtain 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved carefully during the real estate upturn will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since recorded in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could almost be twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five Pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey see themselves confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of his milk by another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after a consulting firm's investigations have been carried out.
Retailers are to decide for themselves whether they wish to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed last year.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A Bangladesh court rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her defensemen said that the court refused bail regarding the charge to have extorted 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government should first grant her unrestricted freedom.
Correspondents say that even though their detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the course of their release whether they will be able to remain on the loose if they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says that she must not receive a bail, since she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a lawsuit against the Supreme Court."
Your lawyers are requesting that they require bail to return abroad to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th, an Awami Federal Party Party Chairman said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatments.
Sheikh Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, denied all charges against him.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination program last week in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of personnel carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses its claim in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its claim against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that the BskyBs’ share distorts competition and allowed it to have a more illogical impact on the broadcaster ITV.
BskyB has acquired its share in 2006 by successfully turning NTL into Virgin Media into a barrier to the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of BskyB’s share of ITV was ready to raise doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have objected to the purchase.
BskyB argued that reducing its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would want to give up its voting rights.
New investigation at the U.S. Public Prosecutor's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special agent to deal with the termination of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the acts of administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The specialist investigator Nora Dannehy is now required to determine whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Serious accusations including criminal action have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a specialist agent with the power to force the witnesses to make a statement was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice dismissed nine U.S. prosecutors from its offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the accusations of electoral fraud by the Democrats.
US U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
Alberto Gonzales, the head of the Ministry of Justice of the State, has been under fire because of the redundancies and has taken office in the final effect.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector-General addressed the role of Gonzales critically by carrying out the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, having "given up" his leadership role and "unusually disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former Chief Adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" introduces the nominations for this year's award, after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there would be some songs that go beyond such matter as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in 1979 as a single in the UK and has reached 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he had collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute inflammation of the throat.
He later became aware that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing residents to say where extra place is, simply because most never heard of it.
This tiny road is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to North between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used transit road.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants Extra Place to reflate to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past block of the house.
However, the city administration department responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and responsible for the street has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee for Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road through the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road stays in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the coming month, says Susan Stetzer, the district administrator of the council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair the road and run what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that the small street will remodel and set up seats, which include a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but they don't want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate these fallen alleys and make them a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Department for Building Protection said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of his historical impressions.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and no one claimed a narrow strip of land.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened up to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, humps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled by "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Extinguishing City"), has published part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sac-hole, which stays dark even during the day and is characterized by rusty metal doors of warehouses, closed windows and by rain drains past flying week-old newspapers".
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like that in an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of released newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road might be slightly polished.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual training: Education in the English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientist in California studies and senior director in the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of successful completion of school with African-American and Hispanic students is lower than with white students" - which is true.
In order to close this performance gap, Obama's education plan recommends, among others, a bilingual transition period in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question to Obama is whether its use for bilingual training, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts its interest in reducing the distance in school services.
Take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in Eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school in English were rated as well.
This amazing success has been achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The school Sixth Street focuses on verification and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate any exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practises the approach by which training takes place in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point Obama is supposed to observe, says school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of English language in technical education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learners?
The school's achievements would ease the answer to this question, but the training policy positions within its own party (the national Bildsunsgvereiningen have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and its own consistent support of bilingual training make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While he agreed that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English only".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish".
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work instead of despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling due to renewed fears about the economy
The oil price on Monday has fallen sharply due to fears that even the American rescue plan for financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
In the morning session, crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the freight markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices in July reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have already shown themselves concerned again, although congressmen had announced that they would have agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the greatest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from complete.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is supposed to buy up Wachovia Corporation's banking operations.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on weekends and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to stimulate the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including for oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the freight markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have adjusted their oil consumption expectations due to the weak economic growth for the coming year downwards and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in second quarter set up
Inside defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been in the jets for the last eight and a half years more often than anyone else.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned into a triumphal move without result.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once slipped out as an outside defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't work very hard," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense took Kurt Warner apart.
Outside defenseman Darrelle Revis took off an unsuccessful throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets re-conquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to the 34 to 0 lead.
These were most of the points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets "The Second Quarter or the Third Quarter?"
Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third quarter than I did.
A lot of points were made in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and has become the first person to make the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Bresselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has at least won a World Championship title or set a world record on each track from one kilometre to the Marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear, which in retrospect might have been exaggerated, that air pollution could aggravate its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - for sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat have changed from Kenya on long distances, the record time for Marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie announced to the press that he had had been fighting in his Wade two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not return rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end of everything great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he was overly orchestrated, many world's best marathon stars in general avoid too much reliance on the race leaders as if this were a race track, and put world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had left behind.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last entry to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamati became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
In the last spring the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and to improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned her course skillfully by leaving out a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Ashale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third at 2:25:01.
Pride and rigour in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the expansions of the amusement parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drifts, lies a quiet city where pride and the complications of African-American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crayons, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida tour guide, which was produced by the German writer project at the time of depression – remains and remains a place of very special variety in many respects.
Eatonville is so independent, educated and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "as little knows about us that he does not know what escapes him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many people are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and community member of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be right."
Eatonville has been defined for a long time as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is on the one hand a stronghold of literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are proud as well as on the hat.
And so correctly the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as here all Hurston calls.
She presented to the world her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "They Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston Reader led to Eatonville's first mayor's shop, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "there is a modern school covered in brown white, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that always care about Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and what goes on for hours."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual invocations.
She added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurtson was still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came into town, she mostly did this without warning, dressed in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and pants, in a city that even today takes a look at its venerable dress style.
According to Mr Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back terrace overlooking the Sabelia lake, where Hurston of all likelihood was baptised.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and lost her books.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
There was no big commemorative celebration in Eatonville, no large-scale public readings.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4 motorway through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Force integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality.
In the 1950s, the struggle against racial mixture brought hatred into the community.
"At that time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the outside people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed there.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court to enforce integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council "respecting rather than respecting my race".
Today, residents say that although the elimination of racial separation was in some respects positive, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young.
"Black children were accustomed to be hugged - I remember - one hugged his teacher in the morning and one hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the charitable group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who set off prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975 the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway found a much praised Hurston biography in the bookshelfs and made it part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter once again stood in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw them as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track long road revived the city, accelerated the whole thing with top speed, aroused real civil pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more trainees, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlando city centre can it sometimes feel like a back road in the summer rain, as small as at the time when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today she is 90% black.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a wise man and representing black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up like any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the disciples, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think: "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here with us in New York, we speak fluently financial latener.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the boot shaft-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror working day since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
The suppliers still push with loud clappings the metal tea scales along side sidewalks and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still crawling around between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with about 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for meals on their breakfast tray on the grassroots and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 7 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, due to all of the world's waste, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I decided to put my commitment on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase headquarters, already about 20 people stood snakes.
Not to the cash desks to collect or deposit money, but to the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for their way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal banker with license", stood for the same reason as I Snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, from places from which they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called twigs (a little like a building savings fund), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year 15 of these banks went silent and silent.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, went to bankruptcy and as last Friday New Yorker drove home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that has savings worth $440 billion, looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another crash, the office and shop staff who incited me brought their Bares to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorker has acquired a flow of finance over the past few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese parent market took so much confidence with regard to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite bank and its demise-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were narrating over a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge of my residence by the age of 50, has come from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I don't go into any risks anymore."
Muslim tombs violated while marching to the right in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-winger of the Austrian rights Free Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organisation "States Against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, embossed with a red line.
The police are accusing right-wing extremists of the graves at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right parties there are significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminals consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the news of the excrement that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan nears the end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which were given almost 30% of the votes to both parties on the far right, were committed in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their electoral claims were criticised by opponents as hostile.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, supported a ban on headsets and burkas and even announced his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses that were carried out immediately after the elections and that the extreme rights are the most political bloc in the country indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
International travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam Rockstar, who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, was ordered out of court to travel to France and Spain.
Judge Glitter laid down a six-month barrier after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted last Thursday to impose a ban on foreign travel after presenting to judges evidence of Glitter's punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
The hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent was not attended by Glitter, the real name of Paul Gadd, but was represented by Corker Binning's law firm.
EIn spokesperson of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday 25 September, Kent police at the Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain by 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present personally."
As required by the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The police in Kent said that they would not discuss individual cases or glitters possible residence in the country.
A spokesman for Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is paramount for the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some of them.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22nd and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was held to travel to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no shakes, no costumes for appearance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen gaze or expressiveness of hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people' the German photographer Günter Bauer presents different theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still not known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco Daring at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of photography of Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which grows ever larger from day to day, explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would enable me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco master with the camera'.
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images developed that remind you of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and the idea, as the Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
This is not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something, which becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, and was the firm aim of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the near future.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sports' ('sportART project').
Although the concepts of the project 'flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me great pleasure in photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their condition of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of today's flamenco titled 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located on the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the road la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is just writing is 'an interpreter'.
He does not yet know where the act of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to push forward the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved into the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is 'a tolerance' and 'all points out that he would not have to write the novel'.
"If I had thought about it, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point," he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Festival Hay Festival and most of the participants gave their voice, is compared with the old edition of `Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, who wanted to experience from 'extraordinary adventure', 'exquisitely at reading' and from 'more than before'; how he writes and 'discipline is true' to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what 'images' are the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American novelist admitted that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books change life, but 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is 'effects' and 'thinks people even more apart', so I asked the writers 'not to leave light' and 'take over responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfights fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the floor of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival was to be completed in Pozoblanco, was moved yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the consent of Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfighting.
Thus the feast was suspended of the inconsistencies of the weather, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, why the second planned bullfight could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had more to do with galloping than with his bullfighting.
And even worse was El July, who went through the arena of Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience responded in his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two persons wanted to escape the control of their car loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the flight.
It looked like she wouldn't have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted her and captured one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Ministry of Interior of the Basque State announced.
The person arrested was accused of trafficking in drugs and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officers of the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the town area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the edge of the road. At the moment, the riders got out of the car to flee over a road to a forest area.
The police from the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, a Iveco Daily, drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hash, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschisch bundles, which were later led to the exact laboratory analysis and deviating the bundle to other police departments.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was ‘double’, so that it did not correspond to the mark indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was carried out for falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue investigations to investigate the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., was taken to a police department for interrogation. He will be introduced to the referee in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend because of driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokespersons of the California traffic police reported the magazine `People'.
The Witness told us in detail that Locklear «after 16:30 o'clock pushed Gaspedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards from the parking lot, and as she drove backwards, she caught herself on her sunglasses a few times ́.
A little later, the Witness, who at first the actress probably didn't recognize that Locklear stayed on a nearby road and left the car.
The Witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had lived 'fear about Locklears'.
When the police strip came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thereby blocked traffic.
'She seemed to be unorientated', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of the officials followed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', according to the speaker.
Locklear was suspected of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and was arrested at about 7 p.m. in a local detention centre.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left Union of Andalusia becomes responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and the Member of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who will have to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out what approach the party must have towards the one who is currently sitting as a councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the breaches of the rules that Silva may have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should be kept maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero book of Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' presents the revised version of the Spanish's famous uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for filming.
In this way, the cinematographer tried to portray a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he had always admired in the works of the famous novelist Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and will later be shown on the transmitter Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdó's literature, assures us that thanks to this filming work his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to film a commemorative film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Above all, because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the autonomous community of Madrid, offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-time opportunity' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of 'disturbed Spain, who had chosen the false leader for the struggle because the people had been put in a state of disillusioned by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the cinematography regrets that you could not expect to finance like `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of film in 'Volver a empezar', was involved in his ordinary way of working: he stood on stage with the actors, with whom one must first try before turning and for those who did not cast, he appeared to provide 'humiliating' and respect, 'a part of the profession of the director of film is to provide help in theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry where one works.'
Many actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither ‘Sangre de mayo’, nor ‘Siete mesas de billar francés’, nor, finally, the selected film ‘Los girasoles ciegos’.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
`In the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's only for growth, and now you're happy when you've produced a movie,' Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville honors a dancer who also dates from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters to emancipate the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist, vegetarian, and sat down for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her tracks in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role, which seemed impossible to me.'
`We're not trying to tell about her life without keeping her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
`The dance of the butterfly' appeared to me, for example, like Guajira, or `the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The staging is based on two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing to Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerto aberetta'; and with Flamenco Master Matilde Coral, who, exceptionally, wanted to work with one of her ex-girlfriends.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The staging also counts with musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with actor Juanfra Juarez, he `takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas into which he is always in love.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who has become known in as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has usually lived in London.
'I wanted to call them back in memory, because I think it is one of the women who has an enormous influence on a particular epoch and whose works no longer appreciate them,' says Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
Thus, `the triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel Chopo de Luz', opened in May and after which it was located in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and will be presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The USA can imagine itself badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then ruling idea of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all of America to Newman with his enthusiastic imagination and followed her.
Now, look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, `my life and my country were the greatest direties of his life.'
Nobody was afraid not to make a fool of himself or to exaggerate.
As 'father' of the cinema and the country of the father, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and of the collapse of the market exists, in which the self-esteem of the US Americans is hopelessly seeking reasons to hold back dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodies a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses as well as profits: from the foundation, which committed itself to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded up to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took him much effort to perpetuate a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of wonder strikes haushoch over Hollywood without regard for nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died but the entire era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, Film Director and Oscar Prize winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the greatest of all of us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of a few who dare to live today as Paul Newman lived: obtain high demands on integrity, lead a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful to him, although there certainly were many possibilities not to be.
`Where should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
`Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropic,' they say.
The streets in Madrid are flawed for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called the perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst street with all that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if we were to observe the evaluation and I could look into it, it would clearly not have gone through.
But, let's go through everything from the start.
The nonsense begins with the ticket collection that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the stuff on the road).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there for that) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt only existed in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
Well, things like this are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks behind, even if it had once succeeded, but it would have been more difficult to recover.
In addition, during this 40-minute waiting period, it looked like rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear on the classification in time because of this chip that I have received, I can already think that the output has been incorrectly stamped out.
Of course, if I was asked for a perfect road, this road would never happen to me.
This is how I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system observes what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also arrange the people present after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that talks with her, and that no company employee is involved.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they talked very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Human being, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is only a statement if you consider that Microsoft added one or other feature in Windows versions and `Extras'.
The change in direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Skills many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
Every time, people pay less attention to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the `window'.
What are half of the applications available in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without doubt. I'm setting a small example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the restrooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshment drink machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online searches.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for research on the network.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless stars appearances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waistlined.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. Legend tells that it is connected to sport and is rooted by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surpasses all because of its outstanding cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag ( barely recognisable) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And respect, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use it as underwear.
You're very charming.
`I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicate, but full of joy of life.
Currently, the brothers and sisters Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mánica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved her residence there and also makes the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in dinner at Valentino's honor.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, I too am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women like they're dressed like they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was a little girl, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to crawl around in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great to go almost better than to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and at rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so much respect for the costume designer and her professionalism.
You've become 30 recently, haven't you been in crisis?
I don't know.
I feel better than ever, than I feel good for thirty years.
I think the woman will be mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time, I've known that I'm a mother, because that demands my body, and besides, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will bring great happiness to my child and raise it with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you participated in and the last year were shot.
That is the same and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you appeared on the racetrack with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went up the path to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the charity of her organization `Women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two items from our collection for mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of things being told about her, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this big-hearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
In order to support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers, who can become backward because of the alcohol level, will need to install the `Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, installs this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholized, the car does not jump on.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is now part of the report of the Public Prosecutor General. According to its information, it is a pilot project which will take a year.
The purpose is to re-socialise the driver, which is why he receives a course for re-education of traffic behaviour.
Apart from the State Attorney General's experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Motor Vehicles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers, who were shown to be under alcohol influence more than once because of driving, are taxed again.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the air exhausted and prevents car start when the driver has performed alcohol tests; or if an alcohol concentration is determined which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevented up to 65% of the regulatory infringements in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it became a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The equipment is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
Tomorrow, the House of Deputies will vote for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-tos'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 am, around the time foreseen by the program, next to the presidium hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, the plane of the Spanish Air Force landed with the prince and prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays have still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple that came out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Oh, very good, so, you can't take people with you at the airport at this time.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a few years.
-Oh, that's it, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and prince of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 Marine soldiers, giving out the salute.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-wounded hairs, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that it is expected a thunderstorm in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official succession is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, waits for her a reporter from Mexican television who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there probably was no great fashion designer and Bonvivanten than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Advisors' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talent.
This is awarded with a cash price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the mango branch window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have happened that are connected with the desire to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table, organized by Mango, seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother died recently, collided. He put on the suit of the fashion house and had some jewelry from ELAH that were stunning. He held on to his son Luis’s arm, which is nearly two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner to his honor.
Andak, the owner and lord of the mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the baron of red shield without jackets, because they borrowed jackets from the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has gone to the store and had a pants and a shirt which she herself modeled, and to the dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after arriving (with his own bed sheets and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not 1000, but one way more to forget chaoticness to us fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are few, all are gathered in a book in which it says how to relax. The book comes in the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7:00 a.m., but even worse, the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life seems to come in.
The office is called the tension and the computers that lead to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and problems of the working world.
However, the number increases, not more than 1001 and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress is called `1001 opportunities to relax' and thus comes the peace, which the book conveys, in the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
The methods are also offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, switch off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some Children Speak at Night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, for example during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason for this phenomenon.
Often hangings with other appearances are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bed nose at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for that.
As we mentioned earlier, there can be very high levels of fiber, stress situations, or exaggeration.
In any case, this is a slightly researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or it can be quite an opposite (crying, crying, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and be advised with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes fear and thus occurs.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoea or with stress).
What you can do is to perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner tranquillity.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
If there is talk in sleep once, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it appears frightened after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to do an interrogation and to get more information.
So you won't be able to achieve anything with it because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says so, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the child that you hear it at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Bad houses... finally.
After a long thirst stretch, Illyhäusern is finally on the field again on a successful course.
Without great effort, the yellow swords played numerous torpances and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, with which the attackers had trouble showing their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance was close to the angle, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and alternatively only Fonderflick with a long shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half period should be decisive with initially two Torchances fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Marais Il Houses, which was exactly right to take back a ball that had been denied by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the Ilhäusian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, thus his teammates had to play out in numbers.
However, Denmark did not know how to use this and did not face any major problems in a Ilhaeusian Elf, which only withdrew a little to 'condensate' its defense, except in the last few seconds of the game in which the ball went very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several ports in Brittany and Norman, the French President decided to meet in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Monday to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope he comes with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was founded by the Breton fishermen to carry out measures in view of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which has reached a record value of over EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive again and to secure the working conditions and payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected with determination by fishermen.
Tuesday morning they led the protest march in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused the poles of nearly ten kilometers long.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not stop.
The Quiberon Peninsula was demarcated by a barrier.
On Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel of Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish cattle did not leave, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant Total Raffinerie in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting in the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
`The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will never give up' and 'will not go to Paris', said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they believe that the limit of profitability of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83, following cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes were adopted by the Kinoleende and the committed actor Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its planes of size from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider issuing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, considers spending more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the 85 billion dollars that he was put forward.
AIG is willing to tax the sale of a large part of its business, its life insurance at international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
There was no confirmation of AIG.
Assets from which AIG might separate include its aircraft leasing portfolio International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the back-insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and its investments in the Private Equity, the FT continues.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sale at the earliest in order to repay the loans over 85 billion that it has granted the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and lose the current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected the plan of Paulson to rescue the banks, a historical case of the courses: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points that had never been there, and the nightday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777,68 points to 10,365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his story (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the 11 September terrorist attacks.
According to the final divestment figures, the Nasdag index, mainly regarding technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106,85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which should once again allow for some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the Members rejected the funds he had requested from finance secretary Henry Paulson.
Almost two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here's a bad picture that makes Congress unable to adopt a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', it added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come `too late'.
"If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, note Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more," warned Brian Bethune, CEO at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, highlighting the feeling of extreme urgency even more, 'that every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial company' in the United States 'with'.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy out Wachovia's banking operations by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets 'not only face an American but a global crisis', added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the state funds in ten years has dropped from 3,632% to 3,827% on Friday evening, and revenue from 4,161% to 4,357% on 30 years last night.
Obama, winner by points in the first television doll
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday followed another to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television show for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, which was to be persecuted by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite handsome, was not 'brilliant' enough to enable him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, which says Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, that is, those to whom it is now addressed, Obama emerged with 39% as a winner from the polls, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them see McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his preference on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitors Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-seven-year-old McCain did not stop putting his unquestionable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, clearly highlighting his opponent's 'naivity' with regard to these issues which were the focus of this first television show.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he emphasized several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be president," he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican polls.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being put out of the form.
He focused his ability to make good decisions and to renew the picture that the world has from the United States.
`McCain has still not understood Obama, on the other hand', opposed this weekend a democratic campaign in which the Republican was accused of not having grasped the complete scale of the crisis that lies on the 'American side of the road'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama bragged before 20,000 people yesterday who had gathered in the rain on the occasion of an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle position' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The coming week could be a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative, Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After stressing once again that he would probably even manage to reduce the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, had the highest priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a 45 nuclear power plant by 2030.
The two candidates are concerned about the issues that were raised on the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Have you noticed that a election took place in Minsk?'
On Sunday evening, young people and opposition leaders demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Some hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since closing the polling rooms on the Minsk market to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they have not even chosen: 'What good is this if they do with my voice what they want', says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is prepared to bring about a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-distributing of visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the outsourcing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the narrative', lamented Juri Potemkin, the Union's press spokesman for democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important to tell the votes, and this is the executive with us.
If Members of the opposition move into Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television time, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation. '
The opposition therefore owes itself to interfere in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, becomes a crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It emphasises that election numbers seem too high and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a election has taken place?, the leader of Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year, asks.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely in line with the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night is receding over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Reason - From the blood that has become safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday's 10th anniversary of her founding, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross's blood supply during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Canadian Government launched in February 1994 a public investigation initiated by the judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and drafting guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While judges still hesitated to report, several provinces then put a committee on the legs whose goal was to develop a new system for the management of blood preserved in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, hardly 38% of the people had confidence in the blood - preservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through working in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before she proudly stresses that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that ‘confidence is something extremely fragile’.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of cattle madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the founding of 1998.
`And we did not have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we called on one of the main directives of the reports of Krefter and Gélineau, which according to exclusion measures are used if one does not know this and if a disease only progress slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, this disease was proven to be transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has a lot of meaning.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable it to demonstrate directly in the donor's blood the presence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period, which takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and that this could not be recognized has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transferring AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of contracting HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, you have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood can.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable getting or writing a blood transfusion to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We have to monitor it continuously', Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate care in addition to a safe supply.
`The need increases because the population ages.
As cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, of which on average only 3% belong to the blood donor population of Quebec. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the fitness criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who make their blood available are not accepted because they are sick, for example, of AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for a year.
`With this 3%, we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and they can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and to make them become regular donors.
Today, life is so hectic that you rarely find time to spend an hour while donating blood," regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye valves and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases such as leukemia.
`A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to reduce more than a thousand yearly.
`We should probably start at the beginning of next year with making it available for transplants', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of cord blood loss as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it,' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decide to play the quarter finals in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall score was the final round of the U.S.L's first league.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetiest minute.
After a first half time without a goal for both one and the other side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had brought a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-final, Impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota through a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this winning game, the fourth of the tricolors in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only gate of all the shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need a game to make me feel better. '
`He has fixed himself too much on it in the first half time, observed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He got a stormy applause.'
Charest sets to the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's sub-election.
`Move the course of our last big border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis, and he followed the guidelines completely..
During his lecture a kind of mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power stations, mines, viewed by Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great resources as during the electoral period.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to rule out holding the elections this autumn, even if he had stated that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision', which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic space', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been a topic of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North is 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most a few perspectives on what could be more worked on: above all on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to the list Mr. Charests, the North owns `Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `Area twice as large as France's `is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is within us', he stressed how to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding space.
Quebec has grown very much by its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister of the press declared.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government', he said.
Moreover, 'with climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be available all year round because of the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, and the natives, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec Government would deal very carefully with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pecuniary member of Ungava), have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A Ministerial Committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Soil Treasures) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which 'man will create a common vision'.
Moreover, the development of the North will take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan is discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as if it was a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in his office.
`As the Liberals who were in office before us, we have thought about turning the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was one of the frequently raised topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename Beauharnois's power plant to Adélard-Godbout-Staudam.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading, which has achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future',' explained Jean Charest.
He referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest emphasises that its commission is planned for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I intend to be with him," he confided to his party members, which led to those random storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact been able to make a choice this autumn, which is possible from the law to him, not yet excluded.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was full, mainly because of a Community mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend gave the liberal party director a platform from nationalist plans, mainly from 'the constitutional objectives', which were adopted without delay: the PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord Plan were adopted with skepticism.
The head of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has re-emphasised the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it did not apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would be much further today', Ms. Marois judged Françoise Mercure at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today).
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a North plan by the government.
'But what we want is that this is not just a great idea', explained the party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back today from vacation.
Letters - A Distinguished Country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz'-Minister (what irony) in the Harper Cabinet last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'spoke' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that, as the only country in question, has not brought her countryman imprisoned in Guantanamo concentration camp home.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened that were being accused of him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to hunt down under inhuman conditions.
The only person who goes to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
This very government also closes its eyes to the torture: It is little interest to them that after so many years of suffering, a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are just experiencing a ridiculous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no longer any morals: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, according to the opinion of a head of government, who is supported only by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party that preaches virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what was the call and the dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this defamation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In its issue of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms and pursues an orwellic logic that the world's largest gold-winning society sought to open a slander charge of over six million against three authors and a small, mediocre publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slanders, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely suppressed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, driving everyone into the ruin, who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
Whatever the process, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible bags of gold mine.
Incidentally, the tactics of these unequal struggles are often to destroy the defenders in order to enforce a consensual regime that makes the opposite face sound and also deters anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things in front of public opinion.
Contrary to what Barrick Gold works in many countries, there are usually debates in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by a club.
So it would have been sufficient if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and yet ignore the opinions of this public?
Apparently this word in the world of vice-president only covers the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a perfectly narrowed view of the term.
In a democracy, slanderers themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the discovery of truth, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It totally denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like rich companies in this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been aware of getting to grips with debates and inconsistencies and solving conflicts.
The disproportionate lawsuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action that restricts this kind of unjust lawsuit.
Rescue for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the leading Congressors, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which is supposed to stop the financial crisis, which has been rocking Wall Street for months, has still to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main elements are: Better monitoring of Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to curb the number of houses seized due to the delays in payment, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the supported companies.
US Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representatives present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be marketable', explained the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street', explained the Democrats.
'This is the fundamental point: if we do not, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous', declared Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that a further failure would have had on investors' moods.
The deadline agreed was this morning's market opening.
The two American presidential candidates, who only took part in the negotiations late, appeared to be in favour of the agreement, without, however, neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet it in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain arrangements for agreement, especially those which would enable owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the executives of the companies saved by the State.
'If the taxpayer is asked to take extraordinary measures due to the lack of responsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to congratulate him.
But these measures are necessary', he said on the American television stations.
When asked if he was going to vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines that I have read [show] that this is a thing that we all need to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the placing of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before extending to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freeze of the financial power and into the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican MPs failed the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not be bought, they believe that the dead end escapes.
In order to complete the perspective for everyone in Congress, one has also added an offer that says that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes to recover their invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added, if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by the Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in case of profits and that can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the winding-up procedures relating to the housing linked to the real estate loans concerned by this plan and to set deadlines for the repayment and settlements paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, it is not yet certain that her plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
'Of course Washington does not understand us,' declared Republican Scott Garett, Member of the Board's Financial Commission, his constituents.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to pay the checkout.
Democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the cucus of the skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be put under any pressure, and to consider carefully which way to go,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we were once again given evidence in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor who has been in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right of vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now there are uncertain times ahead. '
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was currently in the process of nationalizing another bank that was threatened by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the British bank's branches and customer accounts.
According to Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was long his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor rid himself of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yeah, and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity, and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a power position that brings the truly terrible monsters into the world.
But what a great permanent runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83, on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the leap of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality.
For in him a whole country, who was in love with the self-made man, reflected in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting art in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had success at the theatre, on television and soon also in cinema.
The same man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in 1979 at the 24-hour race of Man's, and also a sex symbol, although he had been in a show-up relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets also disappear this mysterious, reserved, committed, and sensitive star from the glamour of the show business, whose puzzles will never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death put the cinema lovers in Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of the memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with it.
The charming Cowboy from the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is once again pressing into memory, and the young man returning his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to Die Katze on the hot metal roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It is called up to a much shorter memory (1990), which is disturbed at his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is at his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans over the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was re-recorded after his death and announced the Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the stunning The Sting (Der Cloou), who was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As an embittered and raging billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was him.
He's still there.
In his career, Epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle joined.
In contrast to several cinema legends who moved out of the film world early enough, Newman should remain in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, its assets, its prunk and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flowed for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, fiendish or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his gliding and his rebellion.
As director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle woman portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his movie Harry and Son, a work full of fine feeling and sadness in 1984.
During the flood of honors that arose yesterday about Newman, his close friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained very much: 'His present has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drift-off, has gone.
We may have seen him standing with the foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this thought it was quite tasteless, even though we still found it funny at the beginning.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman took the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October negotiations in the criminal proceedings began against Jáno's supplement and his accomplices.
In particular, the defendants are accused of participating in organised crime, as well as gross negligence and fraud, and other criminal offences, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutors, the funds which were used for their own purposes from the invitations to tender were used, while the services provided were often invoiced with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are partly to be found in the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the private funds of individual individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented in relation to the tender, and the associations should not have complied with their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices are to have been faked.
The invoice blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies are to issue the invoices was decided on that tour north of Lake Platten, to which István Lados was sent by Jáno's supplement.
In the course of this "exploratory tour" Lados should find out pensions and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumption to be issued later on based on these submissions to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
These invoices should have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
One of the goals of Lados' "Exploration Tour" was a beer room.
As two invoices issued by Supplement and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is expected to host the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesulet.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the premises at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002, on the Stiftung Jobb Jövőért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious defects in form and content.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stopped.
The imagination of the invoicing falsifiers was also not set limits when it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in which accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear at all according to the prosecution authority.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when he was submitted by the prosecutor during a survey of documents.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp".
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated one hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people.
Food was also mentioned on the invoice, the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The current accounting falsifiers have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they have taken to the visa offers travel abroad exclusively, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash invoice, which was also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As was known in the course of the investigations, they have also referred to the invoices VAT, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The total amount of VAT was wrong for four invoices issued by Hotel Révfürunt Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company instead of 25 accounts for only 15 percent of VAT, and the employees also issued only machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "counters" was that in a case they had stated "goods transport" as performance provided, although this is not offered by the firm specialised in investment advice, the prosecutor announced.
Further formal errors - incorrect billing format, false stamps - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesulet and Bizto's Pont could be disclosed as counterfeits.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing director tried never to issue invoices.
Another "mistake" has failed the falsiers at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) just in dissolution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesulet was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator thus indicated that the invoices did not have been issued themselves.
Conscious Fakes
The other group of accounting officers are persons who were quite aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The biogate Kft, which is currently also in liquidation, is also expected to cooperate with Supplement and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is expected to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfényő Egyesület Associations with fake invoices in total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to services not provided.
However, there was also little payment, since invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but what the parties concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers shall comprise persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not inventable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total amount of HUF 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigative authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is expected to have been the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to which the company documents should also be sent by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has been able to present invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations, as well as to Egyutt a Harmak Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their own countervalue.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are expected to have been founded by Romanian masons on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company's start-up documents, he has issued invoices to associations linked to the company, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció, on behalf of the companies.
In total, Cubatov will have issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Cubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice as well as VAT.
The company Szi-Beri Bt. is even supposed to have misused fictitious invoices for the exhibition - in this case the invoices were submitted to the applications of Bizto's Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarrszágért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forint each, but these amounts were used elsewhere.
To cover this up, they have presented the TMA five fictitious invoices of the Works Team Kft..
By the way, these invoices were made available during the search of the Office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, a number of defendants are now expected to make a confession about the method of forgery, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main defendant decided to grant Jáno a comprehensive confession.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report extensively on everything, his confession still stands out.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him on the recovery of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million and whether a contract is prepared in return to assume responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that supplement now plays the "impossible" after his attempts to alleviate the arrest and house arrest had been made on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage to economic criminals and have not paid them, are on their own, or at least under house arrest, supplementation remains a barrier to this possibility.
The psychology of overboarding - or why we are willing to pay more
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and overvalue the bidder.
Neurologists and business researchers from the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the Science magazine, people want not to give in to competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain drain, was measured in the losers of the auction, where the enemy's bid was played an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase could be explained by avoiding overreaction of the stratum.
In order to underpin their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally commissioned investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should participate against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their efforts.
Another group were also promised a 15 dollar reward, in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between both groups was only that the emphasis on winning was on winning while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were prepared for higher efforts than those of the control or "profit" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviour observed in auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedure, so that we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to seek medical advice?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the term used for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases are different.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D can transmit viruses through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, epithelial secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to vaccination against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show about two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
After that, the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine darkens, and recovery may take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimates suggest that only every 10th infected person is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a frightful way - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular control investigations, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more often: those who have undergone blood transfusions before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
As the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
At the right time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, which prevents the risk of infection and prevents cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 organized for the first time by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness for this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith acts like a kind of "merciful" that should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been investigated how far belief in God affects the human sense of pain, the British magazine reported "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electroshocks each, while studying a painting by the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate the majority of the pain.
A brain scan technology has even proved that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project, in which philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University, as well as scientists, also participate.
When the test was performed, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which the electric shocks gave off.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while selecting da Vinci's image, because it was hardly distinguished from the other painting and felt as soothing.
The test subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages at that time, while they were supposed to see either the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "in security" at the sight of the Mother of God as if they were "careed" and they felt "rest and peace".
During the viewing of the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced with other strongly acting images from the atheists.
"We need to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and also does so in many cases," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the effect of a Madonna picture Leonardo or another similar painter on the pain regulation of the believers remains.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're talking about.
On their tenth birthday, Google can claim with frag and right: it is in the pockets of people to find the same as about their heads in heaven: she knows where people spent their vacation, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he makes it right: these would overlook the very essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google was to collect more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original objective, which is to "order all the information in this world".
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs are not yet able to answer because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and to use it later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic also relies on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends tailored products and services due to previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some people are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that excites fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the desire to resist the power of many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties on the occasion, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the case against paedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "Orkut", and also enabled the pedophilia to be identified.
However, personal rights users could still breathe in May when, together with the EFF, Google successfully marched against the FBI in court: in the future, Google cannot be forced to disclose information to the FBI on a secret request with any point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms referring to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, however, it has withheld the list of individual users, or their web and search list, from two months back.)
Google's image thus remains controversial: those who are reluctant to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy through the use of Google services, the company scourges with the outrage which is due to the conservative companies.
In contrast to Microsoft, which is a market leader thanks to Windows, both of them are fighting for the same goal, the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and agrees with enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs".
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes and provides its services for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet – a relationship that has been in the focus, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
For the "Web 2.0" is nothing other than collaboration, i.e. the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains the same, namely, public display.
An average youth can manage his profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook via Xanga, via other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are costed to Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When looking at last night's party photos, the girlfriend will soon find out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed himself, or the employee will be released because in his blog he only makes too honest annoyance about corporate governance - one thing is certain: The term "Privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Those who lead an online life are what they give away from themselves - you could, for example, formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep a secret or even to bypass the Google monopoly can be happy to do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people deliberately don't register on community pages so they can't be found, but also Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore don't generate the best possible profile from the user.
In fact, public opinion waits until Google shows its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even facing IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the ads of AdWords/AdSense are threatening the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the more quickly introduced services not only provide Microsoft but also other software developers with head failure.
Critical viewers, however, also find the alarming counterpoles: For example, the management of the company rejected a protest from employees, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management thought that the staff's many meals were too expensive. However, all this suggests too mildly that Google even went to the knees in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that all of the regime-critical hits would be filtered out, or those that violate the good taste.
The internal regulation of the Group states that no new service will be sought in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again be very severe: while some people think that Google’s book and magazine and archiving projects are now taking on dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provides the material - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best orbs a future in which a person will become frighteningly approachable thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double murderer of Ózd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police has now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to remove the tracks, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were in agreement, they are currently being accused of the aid.
According to information from the news agency MTI, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free footing.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old resident, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is strongly suspected of deliberately murdering several people out of greed.
In the course of the investigations, it was found that the 23-year-old had owed a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to settle his debts, so on last Wednesday he lured his creditor to an area in Ózd where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act by long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon as well as the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange launches purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange's stock packages.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily "E15", Poland's offer includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As reported by the newspaper, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have placed offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that all interested parties would probably be the worst new owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at £5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In its comments on the ongoing international financial crisis, several leading European pages on Tuesday already spoke of the "second 11 September".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to put his own party to the bill behind him, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Part of the press in Madrid also placed the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the brink of collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, the danger is that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "Day Displayer".
Although some countries could still provide rescue packages to their defamed financial institutions, banks with taxpayers' money could save them from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are more banks or banks ploughing, then neither further financial injections nor other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control of money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to debilitating financial institutions, the Viennese "The Standard" recalls. Moreover, as the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that after the Americans, European taxpayers should now also take a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which now sweeps like a tsunami across the old continents.
Although the "savers" would not have to "spoil" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to determine in which case it would be reasonable to take the taxpayers' money in order to avoid an even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the nature of the obstacle sensors?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired the Nissan engineers from Hummeln to create new accidents of avoiding systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system, controlled by Autorobots, a mini-car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in each direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the compound eye, the researchers picked up the idea of the laser-controlled distanceometer.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a 180 degree field of vision within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds, and the autorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If this were not the case, the autobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyauki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Autobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the protective shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they avoid other bees.
And that must be in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the deviation can not be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can be only two-dimensional, only in the direction of the wearability of the tyres.
While the bees here are infinitely open to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotational movement, or the acceleration and braking of the autobot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store it, or by previous maneuvers produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so that it constantly takes only a handful of KB Memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan, will be in production serially within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is a written version of the 700- billion-dollar heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at the purchase of the banks' bad loans.
In the first round half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight on the Eastern Coast, Congressmen went through heavy rescue packages after day-to-day debates to reach an agreement on the 700 billion dollars, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement should only be put to paperwork.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will show effect and it will be efficient, but it will have to do more. According to Pelosi, it was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the economy out.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Washingtoner Zeit Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European Time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger any high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is in turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and also the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the initial recommendation of the Bush administration, according to which the 700 billion dollars should be issued at once for the purchase of lazy securities with loans charged.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion will be spent, 250 billion being available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum will be spent on the purchase of credited, bad securities and more than USD 100 billion will be decided by the President.
The programme is being examined by a Commission of its own, which is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can also buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-based securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying means and companies pay the expected damages accordingly.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as immediate aid for the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, according to Paulson.
However, the chiefs of banks in difficulty and now based on state aid can expect the government to reduce their productions, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas queue.
There will be a reduction in salaries only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each one.
The reduction basically means that if the Ministry buys in the course of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the second-hand bank manager is transferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of lazy loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that managerial salaries are not exceeded.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history, that cuts in managerial salaries are regulated by law, said the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, of the measure.
The State gains equity rights to the participating banks, so that the risk to the taxpayers decreases as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank get better.
The draft law provides that the President will have to make a proposal to the Congress over the next five years on how the taxpayers will return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect us to do, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kapture, said: The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared with August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to previous year's prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only increased slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - the rise was 4.6 percent, and for shoes prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and productions (1.6 percent).
A price decrease was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in papermaking, printing and publishing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry a price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If one considers the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry in the year comparison, prices in crude oil processing have increased most (32.4 per cent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2-percent increase was observed, while the increase in food production, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A price decrease was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The rate of increase in other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In the domestic market, the highest price increase in the real estate sector (0.7 percent) was recorded in August.
Prices went up by 0.3 per cent in the production sectors for consumer goods, while they remained the same in the energy and further processing sector compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector compared to the same period in 2007 (16.8 percent).
In consumer goods sectors, a 6.8 per cent increase in prices was observed, with an annual price reduction of 1.4 per cent for fixed goods.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but in comparison there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The domestic currency grew by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, to the dollar by 7.1 percent weaker, and compared to the August 2007 price, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, even by 15.9 percent.
No more visas in the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian Visa Agreement to enter into force around 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained to representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "all things now depend on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in time overseas."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over the "middle cross of merit with star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also have talks with foreign policy advisers of the Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion rescue package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
The Congress and representatives of the government announced after many days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they had come to an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, have become the central issues of the Presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic topics, while McCains Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was melted down at the same time.
At a election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly adopt the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also included the passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We now have to act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said to 35.000 viewers.
He has not failed to describe McCain's economic visions as "obsolite".
In an interview given to the broadcaster ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time choking about that (...) but notsun is certainly not an alternative".
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the creation of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of executions for top managers - something he insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the draft law as early as Monday.
Press Review of the German-speaking space
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more confident within the camp - so "The Mirror" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine located on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for CSU's dramatic defeat in his article "Bayern's Revolution Kills Her Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its offices.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The outbreak of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as for Angela Merkel.
Quite surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something has ended, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party
Because ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU reached 47.7 percent and fell for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty-percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections 2005, in other words in the much cited Stoiber era.
The modernization, which is consistently conducted by the CSU in the federal state, has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but at the pace it was greatly appreciated. However, without any impact, secularization, the success of education, the progress of East and North Germans in the prosperating regions of Bavaria could not remain the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and self-willed.
It is striking that, in recent weeks, the classical groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial Citizenship and voters with Abitur, such as university degrees.
Here, the support of the CSU decreased to even less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in her "Who With Whom? Party Managers Sustained in Coalition Questions" entitled articles on the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders barely let their cards be seen.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partners this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Schüssel-Molderer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer has responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition, or into coalition, is currently completely open and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ head Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red-blackness, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider says.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which is being run by the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, France.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Mr Járóka, Member of the European People's Party Fidesz, drew attention, in particular, to the eGovernment of education, as it is one of the most serious violations of law committed by Roma children, and this was also the biggest obstacle to their need for redress.
The High Level Conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of the Fidesz MEPs, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be forced out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education was a fundamental human right which was a key role in the asserting of other human rights.
Investments in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the honourable Member's view, it is important that these relations become as broad a circle as possible - Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts his school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased, and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma need to be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated teaching needs to be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, goal-oriented and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of desecration in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to Europe's future as a full citizens," said Járóka.
Since last year's Berlin Congress, the summit has been held annually with the aim of establishing a unique forum for achieving the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national levels, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
In spite of the election campaign there are sometimes no heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates were delayed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of vote is decided at the extraordinary party assembly on the last week of October.
The much-strained duo, however, had already seen that it did not want to stick on her armchairs.
They want to ease the angered group and the party base that demanded personal consequences one day after the "bayer Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "alienregierer" in Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
The Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state of the Hungarian economy, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party’s internal restructurings, the potential successor to Hubers, Vice President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the investigation team, which leads to a possible coalition of Munich with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free voters".
An irony of fate comes that with the list "Free voters" Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature whose anti-dustor appeared the Huber-Beckstein duo first used to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far withdrawn the threads from the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU president called the 28th September "the bitterst day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
Should the CSU, which has also contributed much to success at national level in 2005, not be put back on the ground with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a heel out of her disappointment about the fiasco, believes that the lack of terrain of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however: The wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko Opposition: 110-0
In the Sunday elections, no member of the opposition has made it to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers think that this was due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are legal errors in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not accepted the elections.
Although the 10-million-dollar legislature has been without opposition for decades, the opposition party gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, in the unsound elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time, would "allow" this time some members of the opposition in Parliament.
That's why the ODSs even removed from the previously planned Boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on Russia’s rising prices for natural gas imports. For the relief of price increases, even loans were received, and the country has also agreed to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the country’s gas pipeline, to the Russians. Thus, in the light of the opposition’s expectations, Ukraine was hoping to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have been banned from entering the EU because of the political system classified as anti-democratic.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was on positive movements rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections - provided for temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - which is why opposition leaders should not be present in the press - and, in particular, the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free for example, and Minsk is willing to face even smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state, has been regarded as independent for one month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewich on our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid of leaving only one opposition party in Parliament".
The opposition does not intend to take protests in the light of the results, but rather to try to clarify the need for economic reform for voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of distribution stones, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - said Milinkewich in reference to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's indebtedness and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the "social security" which is supposed to be at the peace of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkewich.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, said to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, and not the words." The absence of the opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will come into force against those schlaumeier who first stamp off and then go to coffee during the working time.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Act" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council Bureau.
">"Road doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," says Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," says Brunetta.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi refers to this: "the choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, therefore, there is now no more breakfast during working time; finish with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile in this regard: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
Rome announces that "within three months the absence of officials has reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 persons are more present at work per year".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration.
"their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the Cadacon appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiling himself with figures about lower job absenteeisms - this is what the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faulpelzes' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's renewals are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the Inail data (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirmed that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as that caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will be the 58th national day for the victims of occupational accidents in order to direct the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nationale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting injured workers, supporting families of victims and raising public opinion".
"An indignant "Basta has raised itself to this point; understandably in tragedy, which, as measured by its magnitude, trigger some vortex in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is certainly also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in the school framework are of particular importance to young people who are a part of the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to divert it from its social seriousness. A legislative standard must be put into effect and improved.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of occupational deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of deaths caused by work is much too high," says Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes tragedy at the end."
"How do you think that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting at school".
"An additional effort is needed - it adds - in terms of communication and raising public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is demanded of a phenomenon which is a social emergency".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work" and denounced "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker back a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work will not be dependent on voluntary or accidental donations that are decided by a legislator from time to time".
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
Audio music over a long period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU in a report published today in Brussels.
"The report states in one note that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable music devices for at least five years more than an hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people who usually place portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume will irreparably damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – that is to say from the Eu – there is a clear risk that is pressing for swift action.
What really matters is to raise consumers' awareness and make this information common.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the control systems already in place so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent Scientific Committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists, thus concluding the communication from the EU, confirm that they are rather concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music equipment and similar equipment."
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could come from too much noise.
These damage can be very limited in which solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of noise exposure can be used.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Communities points out that if the users of portable music devices hear only five hours a week (later than 89 decibels) music so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border are risking the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This means that 5-10% of users of such devices can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it's supposed to be over in March, and in June the balance sheet will be taken up.
This is the outcome of the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" set by the Capitol. This morning, the Commission met in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla spas.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," emphasizes Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain in charge of the City and Municipal Councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve again, as such a project must have a fixed deadline.
In June - as the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Those who call into question the Commission's competence, since they feel that it is indebtedness, Alemanno says: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers good quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in mind so that we work seriously in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to mind. It will employ the best heads of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetically nor static in order to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which will "not only limit itself to the current municipal borders but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s an explanation
A well-known American politician, who is heavily concerned with being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who was decimated by his decisions, the economy of the US and who maintained relations with the existing Islam (and this still does as a private man today)".
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
In fact, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say that Obama will win with a great advantage.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her in the editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
Here is a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until last.
"Tell us what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crucifixes, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
U.S. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murder" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the information concerning the state of the art because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – said the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear, but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism at national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area it is even 65% with the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in what direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups pave the way into the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest giant in American journalism exists today between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the chief editors at national level are certain to share their values with their reporters, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
The managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "readers", Ann. d. Red.) is always a current topic in the US.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it is the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer as it is popular to them and so it becomes a question of taking it or leaving it.
The editors in chief often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance money.
As far as the holiday is concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often "sick" over the course of the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA BELIEVES IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the motion of the estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is established against Coppol for Bankrot in the context of the counter-arrangement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (against which the prosecutor had pronounced themselves) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and get to him accusing evidence.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the White House's 700 billion-dollar savings package: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the recent issue of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the run-up to the Republican Party is spreading more and more into its old and moderate East Coast souls, which always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world and, among other things, win in the south and the centre of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise by the vote of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned is, however, only a small part of the major changes announced by the current economic earthquake or even already represented: not only in the United States, but also in the West, and perhaps beyond it, will be affected by it.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-awaited events that are finally taking shape under these new conditions and coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close connections with foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of private households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which is an enormous mass of voters.
So the crisis appears global economically and politically, it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems thus to have come to an end and lost its right to speak: the illustrative proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, is not a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, amongst other things, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more serious, only the US can be saved in the economic situation without outside assistance.
In addition to the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two conditions that cannot be overvalued – in certain circumstances – that will probably not otherwise be able to resort to international organisation and no market in a similar way.
Incidentally, the new emphasis placed on the national element is perfectly consistent with the ever-greater importance recently associated in the economy with the most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now, when we were so convinced that we have long entered a networked realm, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of immaterials, that we need to discover at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although all of these can be transported from one place to another in the world, they are still connected to an outermost part of the earth – one territory.
Therefore, the one who has such territory is in favour of another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief boost.
Anyone who has a territory, who has a government, who says politics, says leadership as well.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament of existing leaders, i.e. those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large sections of the population seems to pave the way for it not only to the actions of the social elite, but already to its world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as always more foreign and surpassing.
The demand for leadership thus subterraneanly nourishes a branched but powerful movement of the demising of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the immediate reversal of the collective state of mind of recent times: beginning with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy plays a role here).
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative of what is going on today in the lower social strata of the West, and from the financial crisis to the over-dimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super sticker that lets go up on walls
The forces of gravity to defeat thanks to a adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached almost the target.
With a glue applied on a surface of only 2.5 sq.m., the researchers have succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine – has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the glues already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered with microscopic deer, which give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of reptiles and at the same time "free from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
"This material could be used as a perishable adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
About how Spiderman can get up on walls? Perhaps so, but the researchers think of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical equipment, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could fall within the field of space.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER PART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new species of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a adhesive made of microfibres that clean up like hair by moving on a surface and thus always maintain a perfect liability.
Medicines: never take fruit juice
Care for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on their absorption by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again issued an alarm: There is enough glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medications such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTE IN GEFAHR – The same Agency of the medicine in a report two years ago warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture, and stressed to care for what is being drunk in connection with medicines such as diazepane or methadone.
IT’S NOT just GRAPERRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba's appeal, Director of the Università Statale di Milano, says: "These results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, do not shyly ask a pharmacist or a doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Economic Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economic Prize is awarded to American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the relocation of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of Enron’s collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to the history of the US than the attacks.
A prediction, which received little polemics as an answer and was held to the economist years later, proves to be entirely correct today.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals has disappeared from the public perspective in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "econom of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style, which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package
The day of OpenOffice.org release 3.0 has come; the open source software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself with some new features to the audience: in addition to a revised and now more Spartan-designed start menu, a compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system has finally been achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, attention has been paid to compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, which allows OpenOffice to read new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates, for example, sending via email. This also includes the ability to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserve the original image of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which expands the typical graphics of Adobe format to include the elements of a table and a word processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: Tables can now be processed several times by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a Frabe in order to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result will be published.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
Although free of charge may be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: eventually, various public administration and schools have already gone to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opening up business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims to push Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more well-known access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand already.
Also carbon tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case will open in the course of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on their website.
The 26-year-old carbon from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who has been tested positively for Cera, the third-generation Epo. Previously, this was already encountered by the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the Germans Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the coal blood samples are among those carried out by the Losanna and Chatenay Malabry laboratories in the last few weeks.
If the counter-samples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epoch and, according to the Associated Press, also the Austrian Consents.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THE EMPLOYMENT: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASK: IS ITALIA RASSISTICAL?
Italy, "the former country of the emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken up with resistance.
Do this from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This question is asked by the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the whole subject of racism in Italy and about the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a package of cookies.
The case shows what the Times calls "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North are to be found".
As confirmation of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underscores the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study by Sunia, the rental agency, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious trains. All the crowds of students lose their right to study as effectively as their families are not able to support them at this level" – says Sunia, Laura Mariani, responsible – "in these cities, the huge demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-lets.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which lead to a revision of taxation at lower rental prices.
With a closer look at the study, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping space is needed in the Brianza district about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nre Bande quarter) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, sleeping space costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a sleeping space, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in the outside district can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari there is a sleeping area of 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where renting to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent of 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex kinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sale complexes in the periphery, means in the long run death for the single cinema in the center. A process that not only appears irrevocable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
The most affected are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom one has put a piece of road full of emotions", says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the big prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably lost cinema world.
The figures supplied by Anec, the central business association, speak a clear language: over the past five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to be closed; most of this was paid by cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main blame is the multiplex kinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of modern cinemas has been recorded: with 195 in the last 5 years Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in Tuscany as well as Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all, the preservation of the already existing one, because closes a hall in the city, not all of its regular customers are willing to look for a multiplex cinema in periphery instead of the old one.
And here is the lack of a budget for the trade union fund out of consideration: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed per year".
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of its fears, decided to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Under the measures envisaged, tax incentives are also available for the cinema operators, as well as benefits for the public in terms of public transport: it will be allowed to travel to the restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a happy initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But certainly we also need a better audio and video equipment to gear up against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because finally the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of Baghiera's "supercinema", the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the "nuovo cinema paradiso", even though I have been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli..
The accusations of the administration of the Antimafia authorities of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, which were arrested this morning for the development of Mafia shops, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the Clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the Clan's boss, had already been sentenced to a sum of 10 million euros for the development of criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm, the lawyers wrote, "had the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting."
"This made it possible for the Mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls officially and to decide on the policy of public administration."
The President of the Calabria Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in its region, "there is nothing but an exception to encountering connections between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places in which the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are virtually unavoidable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the Clan Piromalli police were deposed.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, has been elected the head of the Middle Right Coalition after the elections of May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the resolution of the council.
He was interested in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explain in connection with this morning's arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From a hearing campaign in connection with the Dal Torrione case investigations, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is an unsailing source of money, which covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now seems to understand the great energy companies of the world.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and are also looking for occupiers, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; not by chance, these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
As the oil price broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy is being fuelled, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the energies generated by ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides were added.
Giants at the attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector that are focusing on marine energy production.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – according to the spokesman of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs the possibility of working with us."
This is about obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is not an underestimating sign, i.e. considering that oil is still being promoted by the US in Alaska and President Bush recently started the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not known, so observers speak of increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts speak of a technology still in its wake, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small scale and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, there is a need for technologies with far greater impact on the environment.
There are different options: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected buoys for example.
The push of the waves, which move the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity will be sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also serve for military facilities.
In fact, Verdant Power already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot with the help of underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during the tides drives the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, a particular interest is immediately earned the potential that is present in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest already $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million have been planned for 2009.
