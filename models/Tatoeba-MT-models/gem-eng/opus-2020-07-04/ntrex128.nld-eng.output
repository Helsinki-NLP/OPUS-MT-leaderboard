Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they will be ‘compared with Muppets’
There is an uproar among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is being ridiculed.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘is rhyming on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for mad and pwp is Welsh for doll.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is 'dissatisfied' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is "open" for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short one.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently preparing legislation to implement the change of name, said: 'Of course, it is the members of the National Assembly of Wales itself who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be rebaptised to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MVP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus, and in a few weeks she will have to submit a draft law on the changes.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly operates, including rules on suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their new title when they debate legislation.
Citizens of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
Sunday voters vote to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a serious dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim in its territory and has repeatedly objected to requests from Macedonia for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the change of name, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have a hard time
“The older people I spoke with said that there used to be a café and a church at every corner,” said Mr Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church.'
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
"People now have a different way of social contact," he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly check out.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, ‘and early or late they leave at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will cause these churches to be closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to this apartment will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930 ’ s.
A black church community from nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church community led by Honor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shopkeepers on 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building became seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Honor Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Honorary Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beard 'the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the beard in July referred in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beard in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beard of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Dr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The Consistorie (the governing body of the parish, consisting of laymen) wrote the episcopal in July to express her concern that the diocese would ‘calculate the costs’ to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark hurts 13-year-old who dives to lobsters in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who fell to lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been playing with friends on Saturday for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy called out because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized “that the boy called out, ‘I’m bitten!
I'm bit!'
His key leg was completely open,' saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It is not a conscience which sharks are responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles told us in a press conference that a shark had been mocked a few weeks earlier, but that it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburys wants to break through on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's goes on to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and set up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in supermarkets.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove successful, they will be introduced to even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also due to the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where there were ever televisions, microwaves and interior products with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees is also more space, with a tag per brand, such as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also puts its Boutique make-up back on the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are demanding more and more.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops. The first one was previously opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second one will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and buy small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more efforts to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the stores will look more and more like supermarket houses, as the supermarket chain takes it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food have increased and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his departments Beauty and Pharmacy a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in 2000, but the cooperation was terminated when a conflict arose about the distribution of revenues from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments have been sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago for an amount of 125 million pounds.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the decor of our beauty department, so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands we offer for everyone a bit of will, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'wrong' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is 'wrong' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, because at the last moment she has withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was 'wonderful' when Willoughby announced on Tuesday at a difficult meeting in the headquarters of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that due to her new contracts (with a value of about one and a million pounds) she does not have enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune from an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was blown away when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse of the main settlement in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars of Great Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March 2016.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will soon be M&S's brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: 'We have no comment on his business.'
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He grappled about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find 'unexpected for a president', and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I gave up nothing."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been held.
Over three months after the Singapore Summit in June, top diploma Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘contractual reaction’ by the United States following the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, he says, the United States continues with its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
'We're doing very well in North Korea,' he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results and that the missile tests had ended, were hostages and the material surpluses of American soldiers had returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach with regard to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, there would be about 200 people here,” said Trump, while he was in front of the audience.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population no longer had housing, no national disaster was reported, which is a requirement for international aid to be launched.
‘Unfortunately, in many cases it is clear that they do not seek international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs Sumving.
Save the Children is compiling a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the foreign helpers can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still extremely badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but on other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was valid, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
It can also be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another in ideal conditions.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's homeless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko faces a shortage of funding, and that while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the streets, with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge van Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a competition at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's destination, at the time his team was behind with 1-0.
He pointed to the left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the far pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty zone, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He detonated the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible,” said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and ventured an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked at the ball.”
Chelsea stood at rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The top of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the midfield to the half of Liverpool's game.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midfield.
After that, he gave a nice stitching pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty zone.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays at 15am on Wednesday in the Champions League's group phase against Napoli, in the Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea recorded it in London at 3:00 p.m. against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The tsunami death toll in Indonesia runs up to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the agency for assistance in national disasters Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a power of 7.5 last Friday, with waves of 6 m high, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after woman's been stabbed to death
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 hours in Grayson Mews on John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has only just begun, but I want everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard any suspicious requests to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to make contact if they may have filmed something via a dashboard, because they can have information that is essential for our research."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman on the spot came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying at the scene.
She just keeps repeating, 'What a shame!'.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the ward, and a third was just outside.
Within the detention area, a number of agents watched the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or anonymous contact Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111, indicating log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue to the British Parliament is the newest victim of the rewriting history-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban’s destruction of the many cultural and religious objects of art carried out by his fanatical puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as 'crazy' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to showing the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many believe must still be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether that is a perfectly correct representation, there is still a debate on it.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of that gap.
Its achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.'
Ridiculous Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a Southwest market in China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, known only as 'Yuan', was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province. His artery was pierced and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the infestation of pigs at a pigtail, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He was said to have left the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday with his cousin to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to open a door to a neighboring pighood.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth in the pig's stool.
A forensic study showed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bled and maimed,” said the nephew with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't from Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told the Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent the others from attacking, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It is said that the Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have been cases of pigs that attack people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to get seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can excite.
“They’re just games.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weak as she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a local hurricane of category 1 at 5 hours and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sundays.
Meanwhile, a trog begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the south west of the U.S..
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread rainfall in the southwestern region in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, torrents of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected to be between 5 and 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Suddenly floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, because the tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can reversing ravines into deserted rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall during the rainy season.
Spreading tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which rain is spread more at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can shake strongly, because the North Pole is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the US, it is expected that October will start warm, with temperatures everywhere that are shaking around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can be 27 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that up to mid-October there is a high chance of above average temperatures in the Eastern United States.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks on Thursday for Brett Kavanaugh's aggressive testimony, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that was reported to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was infecting her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an informed testimony that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20,4 million people reported by Nielsen looked at Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No figures were immediately available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
For comparison: this is about for a play-off of a football match or for the Oscar issue.
Fox News Channel, which supports the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras from CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that protesters shouted at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stood with down eyes for a few minutes while being scolded, live on CNN.
"I'm right here for you," said one woman.
‘Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone cried out, 'You have power, while so many women are powerless.'
Flake said his office had made a statement, and right before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels sent everything live out when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the fact that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee by the next week, something that the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of her plans to leave the European Union from ‘a political game’ with the future of Britain and to undermine national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's charges was 'absurd'.
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the player of LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of death, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The coroner of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the police of Southern University and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva van LSU thanked the local police for their 'work and pursuit of justice.'
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds each season.
On Friday morning, LSU-Basketbalcoach Will Wade said that the team 'kapot' and 'in shock' were killed by Waydes.
‘This is an event that you always hope it will never happen’, says Wade.
Volcano spits as in Mexico City
The ashes that are spewed out by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded for a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several rumbles and vibrations.
On social media, pictures of a thin layer of ashes appeared on car windshields in the districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital city, the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a power of 7.1 on the Richter scale hit Mexico.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Political clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the birthday of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists successfully hit with riot police, while thousands of participation in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the riot police cooled the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, paratroopers broke out with the police, and the cops pulled their bats up to stop the fighting.
For over an hour pro-independence groups sang: 'Don't forget, don't forgive', while their opponents called 'Long live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for slight injuries they suffered during the protests, the local press reported.
The tensions continue to rise high in the region of independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who were opposed to divorce were boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, with violent screenings coming.
Pro-independence groups had camped the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied his wife in the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful of the prospects of Catalonia for independence.
‘Last year we’ve been through one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in December in the regional elections, even though they were close, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success, because many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-appointed exile or in captivity pending a trial of their role in organising the referendum and the proclamation of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are getting higher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he is taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
‘A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to challenge the decline in the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,’ he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was hit by a car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeated in a Londonderry house.
The incident took place on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the goal of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone brought them victory
It promoted Livingston to surprise the Rangers and provided Steven Gerrard with his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to an equal level with Hibernian.
Gerrards team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to take Sunday against leader Hearts, who stands for eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, the team has won six consecutive races in his department, and Coach Holt hasn't suffered any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingstone misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt’s team had long been able to make a head start for the first goal. After all, their direct way of playing gave rise to all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who caught Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball above the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances to be calm and confident.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored out of the penalty zone.
At that time, the Rangers had been playing ball for quite a while, but the defense of the home team was unmistakable and goalman Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Ranger target Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a lead by his colleagues from Livingston.
Ongoing progress was made in the area of Livingstone, but they were always won. Twice a penalty shot was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's 'fenomenal' analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played outstandingly and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest region, but in particular Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swept up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were running on top of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were unable to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they succeeded only once to break up the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better. After all, they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together on Saturday (29 September) breakfasts in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police shouted for security reasons when they defeated the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voice, condemning both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 hours local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident with a flight crime on Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were identifying the man and will inform his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Chips Wounded by Order Disorder
Six civilians were injured in an order violation in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sundays and are still in progress.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ ciphers are used to resolve the situation involving eight prisoners in one department.
The chipiers were treated locally for slight injuries in the face.
A spokesman for the Prisoners said: ‘A specially trained prison staff has been deployed for a recent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and, at least, those responsible are referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin there are over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the director of the prison in the hospital was reported to have been treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to prison for a serious disorder of order in which personnel were attacked with pool games.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive consequences for drought areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which brings with it risks of flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has issued sudden flood warnings for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang right over Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday evening it will rain already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetre precipitation, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogolon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the south-west of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For those areas that are not at risk of floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently suffering a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought zones are designated, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona accounts for at least extreme drought, the second highest category reported weather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane power on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located at 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it is weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, resulting in a significant flood risk.
‘Dimensions of a total of 8 to 15 cm are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reportedweather.com.
Rosa travels north across Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the Arizona border in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then pass by Arizona and in the south of Utah on Tuesday evening.
‘The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to result in life-threatening sudden floods and torrents in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teen was found injured on Saturday at about 4 hours local time in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stabile’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has suffered in common, the rage' of the Democratic Party
'A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh constantly 'has suffered under the common, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed to Congress on Thursday, denying the powerful and emotional assault of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her incitement.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people saw the beautiful and incredible character, the quality and the courage’ of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognises one of the most comprehensive legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record of service,’ he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘Over five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives takes place.
I don't participate, but actually I do participate," he said.
'That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates.'
Trump said that the Democrats are on a mission to 'oppose and hinder us'.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, said a team member of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
At a great earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many being swept away from the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met Friday for a festival on the beach in Palu City, when waves of about six meters high ashore struck at the time it began to shimmer. Many people fell to smash and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not immediately walk away and became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Bureau for Aid to Natural Disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On aerial photographs released by the agency for help in natural disasters, it can be seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been distorted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be trembled by aftershocks.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long narrow bay, has even enlarged the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been collapsed.
He said some deadly victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage can be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala ‘lights completely flat, we have no information at all’, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,’ said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had struck Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time of the warning.
In amateur images shared on social media, you can hear a man screaming at the top of a building in panic at people on the street downstairs to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacués still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for assistance and is closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit Sunday evacuation centers in Palu.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
True, World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office search shelters in tents of deck sail, but passed on on the road signs of devastation, said Doseba.
“They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be authorised if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It’s still a disaster at provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people continued to hope that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people so love to be in terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, helpers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with the corpse of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandaki.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional load,’ he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the sportsmen in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey pick appeared instead of two blue picks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $2,750 in the supply of ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning stealing thieves $2,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport Police.
The driver had just emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's staff and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been named Ye for a short time and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which appeared in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the show maker.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his current artist name. Earlier West told him that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, West said earlier this year when he told Big Boy about the title of his album.
"So I am you, I am us, we are.
I've crossed from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already worked with and without the coupler and the capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country stands on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people, and left-wing student movements all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
United States should double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States has to double the amount spent on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, last year China announced its plan: by 2030 the country wants number 1 in the field of A.I. innovation.
‘The budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.’, said Lee.
This week, Lee said in an interview with CNBC, a doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the likelihood of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, as it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
“China doesn’t pick up our best academics, the companies do,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting the best of universities to work on A.I. in recent years.
Lee said that US efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
‘The doctoral student in the field of A.I. should be offered a green card automatically’ he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academic world in the initiative, and announced to the White House the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in AI Next's initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than 100 million dollars in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation which should lead to the creation of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in jeopardy for months.
Macedonians vote in referendums on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in their country’s name in ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragging on for decades and would no longer hinder Greece’s Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province, also called Macedonia, and says that its northern neighbour's name means that it claims Greek territory, and therefore Greece vetoed the accession of Macedonia to the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot sheet is as follows: ‘Are you in favour of NATO membership and the EU accepting the agreement with Greece?’
‘Opinions of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
‘I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient MEPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be required to change the name.
The National Electoral Committee said that there had not been any reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, the rise was only 16% at that time, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
‘I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,’ said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change of name of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back gate,’ said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' said Zaev after the vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required attendance.
Another poll, conducted by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% would vote for that.
If the referendum is to succeed, then the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling met with Brighton’s defense in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It seemed a whistle of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian peak was first played on the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straightening in the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton's penalty zone.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty zone to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat target man Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
'Aguero has trouble with his feet,' said coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
‘We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful stitching pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player entered the ball just before he was too far.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there wasn't much reason to force a new start.
Still, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are any consequences for the Rockies’ participation in the play-off. They currently stand for one competition at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least managed a game card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but they still want to do everything possible to ensure their first section title.
‘Although there’s nothing left for us, at least we can pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sundays, but are reportedly inclined to put Scherzer up as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was supposed to launch his 34th, was in the design field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘All that we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't participate, but actually I do participate. That's why I come everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take the power back, no matter what they should do for it. You see the commonness, the atrocity.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'stand up and hinder us'.
‘And we have seen that over the last four days,’ he said, calling the Democrats ‘boss and mean and false and lying’.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to noise from the public.
"Do you remember what she said?
Did you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who have to get that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.’
And that was so during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I have been locally Labour Members.
Unfortunately, today this is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of a 'more gentle' politics, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable for the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, Collages, who, as far as I knew, had a political view similar to me, suddenly expected me to make a turnaround and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed with, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak for an audience, whatever I say, social media gangs are being called upon to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, exposing the centre's politics and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that very serious abuses are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every 'motive of mistrust' or change of selection rules the party becomes smaller.
For the past two years, I have often been given the advice to hold up, not just loudly proclaim my opinion, and then I would ‘not get into trouble’.
But I didn't go to politics for that.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always pleaded for better public services for those who need the most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as Minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my differences with the current leadership.
To those who have advocated the Friday motion, I can only say one thing: when the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections or not to stop me from acting in accordance with what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeatable Ayr on his way to the top
Two late try's may have had the final result a little rough, but there is no doubt that Ayr is quite triumphant in this wonderful game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're at the top of the classification now, the only unbeatable team of the ten.
Eventually it was both their superior defense and their better chances that the home team would bring victory, and coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied.
“We’ve been having a hard time in our competitions and we’re still unbeatable, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, made by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card by Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors contest), Melrose was able to speak the figures and Jason Baggot managed to break down a game.
Climo provided a penalty for an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solory just before rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and the try of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The game stopped for a long time for a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off on a firecard, and once the game was restarted, Ayr could continue to run through a try of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Director Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and once again Melrose took off with the extra man when no conversion followed Bruce Colvine's trial at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he beat Climo without the ball, MacPherson made a touch-down on the penalty-line out behind the emerging Ayr-mul.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran is going from Still Game in the hotel. Apparently he was appointed director of a restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that K is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that K run was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blossoming restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country-bound Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Zeelui patrol in a tug-covered marine office in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean blue flag waving.
On all marine bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
In the whole of the country surrounded by Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline that the country has had to give up to Chile after a bloody 19th-century commodity conflict is still alive, as is the desire to preserve the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the ruling of the Court of First Instance on large screens, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will plead in favour of Bolivia that Chile is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea after decades of quiet conversations.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial fight for reelection, much is at stake in the verdict of Monday.
'We are very close to the return to the Pacific,' he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court probably will not decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and even if so, little would change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final decision was taken.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, quite the contrary, in the last four years the situation may have become even worse.
‘The matter of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,’ said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the good will that Chile might have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk about this later.
The two countries have no ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given ‘an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of international relations with Chile’ and an opportunity to ‘end 139 years of disagreement, with mutual benefits’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific," he added.
‘The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit between the rival leaders in Singapore.
He said this at the moment that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to re-launch the nuclear diplomacy that has been stuck, more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a 'utopia' that the permanent sanctions and the American opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get on the knees.
Washington does not tend to agree with the statement without Pyongyang taking important steps in the area of disarmament first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But skepticism prevails, and it is doubtful that Pyongyang is serious when he says that he would refrain from an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon to buy from you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not search any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazily oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gemstones, a magic hat and even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were closed. They looked more on Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkeling and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two meter wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared on social media everywhere also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was nearly as large as the model in bathing suit that the bag was carrying.
The reddish raffia bag, set off with raffia chips and finished with a white leather hanging, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big summer hats and beach bags lying in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent status in academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a new series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for continuing and higher education, the career chosen by them and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust bonds with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year, we can conclude that languages are on top of the ranking list, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated to SCIS, shows that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score ("A") in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students achieved an A as well as 69 percent of students in French and 63 percent of students in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now rated as professionally as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A study by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
So language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Now that more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with foreign people automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage to competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that was above 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages, particularly those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialised in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at the moment that languages in a global business environment remain vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's an ugly bee.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut on Sunday with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We still have to determine how many minutes he'll be playing.
“It will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week James was asked for his plans for the schedule of the Lakers for the six races prior to the season.
‘At this stage of my career, I don’t need any competitions before the season to prepare myself,’ he said.
Period of election rally from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallyes
It is the first of the five planned rallyes of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that are fond of him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he elects for the vacancy has been held in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
What time does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday September 29, 2018, at 19 u.
You can view Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for candidate Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main aim of this series of rallyes is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the elections in November to get more emancipation.
The campaign leader of President Trump said that these five rallyes were intended next week to ‘stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Deputies’, says Reuters.
‘Control over Congress is so important for his programme, that the President travels to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season begins’, said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned by name to Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and are being discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of chances is a fully invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who gets the best chances at the moment?
“They first had a head start of six points, and now that’s only four more, so we find it so little that happiness is on our side at the moment,” said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of standing in front of four points, while 12 are still in play.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have scored every three points of the four.
Spieth has been a feared opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial putt with which the four race was a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two races.
His pit with which they won the race at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can distract that he believes that the American team has not yet been defeated.
"You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but wonderful European duo has four in four and can't do anything wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that saturday did not play bogey, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided  bogey's.
As a result of this series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who must be defeated on Sundays. If Fleetwood of Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A  bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede they no longer overcame.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you to catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, the European team has played best and has a fine lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to go on fighting, something that some people, especially in the US, dispute.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they stand with 10-6 on the United States.
The inaugural duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had it difficult, making them now have four points ahead of them in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blushing Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer catch up with its backwardness.
The team of Jim Furyk must score eight points during the 12 singles games of Sunday in order to be able to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while Molinari and Molinari, who received the nickname 'Molliwood' after a sensational weekend but the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup are winning four points in their four opening races.
After putting Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two competitions on Saturdays, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the mornings, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it did not run from a tarmac for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with three points on Saturday.
They won a hard match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furyk has enough to match, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack seems to be too high on Sunday.
North Korea says that in no case will it disarm unilaterally without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that the constant sanctions are leading to more and more distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would in no way be able to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ‘important goodwill measures’ last year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
‘But we do not see a corresponding response from the US,’ he said.
'Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally.'
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about the resistance of Washington to a ‘fascinated’ approach to denuclearisation, where North Korea would be rewarded as further steps progressed, it was noted that he did not reject the unilateral denuclearisation a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the ‘denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US calls for 'denuclearisation first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.'
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the American leader had made at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: ‘If the other party were to be on this issue of denuclei South Korea and not the US, the democratization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the U.S. continent were directed so that after 'Mr. Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Mr Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim to the United Nations this year to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denounces.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: ‘The enforcement of sanctions by the Security Council must be continued forcefully and firmly until we have realised the complete, final, verified democratisation.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea told him about setting 'gostery requirements'.
North Korea promised this month, at a meeting with Moon, to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take ‘similar measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘agreement measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, trying to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night long and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a talk about the influence of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I only hearing this in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In the course, which is organised for the first time this year, the students explain the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a severe sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see an image of a dormitory room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine at bedtime.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep shortages increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Through a map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we think that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of cigarette choice on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of ferrets on a night study still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep shortages are an increasing problem.
Sustaining sufficient sleep, of good quality, must be the ‘secret weapon’ of the student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course. He had attended the professor’s class last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to ensure that the course became available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to stand up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult for you to fall asleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to destroy Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their match again disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory in a competition since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team managed the defeat, hardly the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team now has eight points behind Hearts, which goes further to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers are now sinking to the sixth place, Livingston is rising to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers might have even more problems, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitors' team supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They passed Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same 11th for Livingston, who managed to cut off a point last week. He would have been excited about the way his well-trained team blocked the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball ownership, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes when Menga left the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in sight, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached Commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defender Alan Lithgow was kicking against the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take over control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than actually believing in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found in any case that he was entitled to a penitentiary when he and Steven Lawless were fighting after 15 minutes of play, but Judge Steven Thomson waived the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot to the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be a target at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and the tame shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not sit in the extension of the general game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not prepared against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and chose Menga, who entered the ball with ease.
Gerrard made a break with the switch Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced off his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play a kind of game that Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett continue to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor held a good stand and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty kick at the end of the match after an encounter with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geiger counter.
Since then, the geigerteller has not been thinking away from science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the first place:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘That’s a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this main phone, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!’
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, barely a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise malignant cells during treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a laboratory
They can then “see” a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and is then re-injected.
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells from a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in cancers of all kinds. Next, the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "From our results, we have a highly promising vaccine.
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of various types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to address cancer cells has already been shown to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West detachs pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't work out the way he hoped.
Kanye West was published at a broadcast by Saturday Night Live after an inconsistencies in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would become president candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third number of the night, Ghost Town, with a hat on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he cut off a tyrate against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“Frequently when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you sympathize with Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been out of America for a long time," he said.
The Saturday Night Live broadcast began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accused him of.
The tyrade of the West was not broadcast, but comic Chris Rock uploaded them on social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to stab the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken under fire to get his hat.
‘They’ve hit me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on the stage with that hat."
They've hit me!
And then they say I'm apathetic, he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?’ He said he would put on superman cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience came at least twice the boat call and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard from an presenter: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was the last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest minds: KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE MASSA TREATY.’
But talkshow-presentator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘normally himself, and that’s beautiful.’
"But I choose not to reward (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') someone who harms, supports and spits my community.
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on he is, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega rapper Snoop Dogg also bore the name Snoop Lion and the deceased music legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then formally known as Prince in The artist.
Indictment of attempted murder after severance in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear on Monday before the Belfast police officer.
The charge will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington extracts to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role of swordfighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy game of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor is reaching out to the macho hero’s stereotype and says that young boys often think when watching such roles on the screen that they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that ‘there was something wrong’ and asked himself how to tackle the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones' co-star, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me personally right now: where did it go wrong with our humanity?" he said.
"What have we taught men when they grew up, which is why we are now facing this problem?"
Kit thinks that television might sometimes be partly responsible for the rise of toxic manhood, due to its very male characters.
He continued, ‘What is inborn and what is taught?’
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's major questions: how do we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit plays in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he found his meeting with his wife Rose to be the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I kept my future family and my life alive from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected by it in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, only 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was not previously true.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood in the past.
But the number of people who run HIV in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Since 1997, homosexuality has been no longer punishable in China, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
The conservative values of land would, according to studies, suggest that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been promising universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff worker has leaked data from Republican senators and derives from ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against the allegations that one of her staff has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles claims that the accusations are spread by 'extreme right' contestants and websites.
‘The lies, lies and even more evil lies’, said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and the private phone number of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data was published online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct at Brett Kavanaugh's address, candidate judge of the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters staff member, the Hill said.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
Waters' statement has been rapidly criticised online, including former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry', Fleischer wrote.
‘From this you can see that she doesn’t have the temperament to be Congressman.
If anyone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He must not be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecution's motives.
He needs to stay calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters with the criticisms of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of excessive anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the interim elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Nice, if it is true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators become known,’ she said, ‘and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff members.’
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now looking traditionally for references to the Brexit, and that does indeed appear to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comical action films with a weak spy in the leading role, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was created in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy amateur about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with pulsating eyes and flexible visions manages to send everything into the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can conclude that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinematographers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamorous, a little Clouseau, a wing of Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson used to play in Barclaycard's TV spots (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) that always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades just ticking against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough too, especially now the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impressible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do so well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and Johnny English's horrific disaster is less original and focused on me than the jokes without the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, which has made known the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain, to the great dismay of the agent in office, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that makes the bucket run over from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and awfully unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script does not provide much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she has to use a retired spy, since every active spy has been compromised.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the English spies think of School of Rock.
English is quickly unveiled at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pitiful help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and jovious role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister regrets the charms of the charismatic technology billions who claim he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssee of clumsy crazy fun: dressed as waitress, they set fire to an eyeful French restaurant, they roam on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English unchained pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with Volta's house interior.
For that, all registers are pulled open, but no matter how good-meaning the scene is, it does a little thinking about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And like the other films from Johnny English, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan whereby British people work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
It is said that the party would like companies' bosses to pass on to their employees the savings they make as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn equally much.
According to sources, the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to break the country's balance in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one moment to the next, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits in with the party's efforts to increase the balance in the economy for the benefit of the workers and that also fits in with the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
At the moment, however, the efforts are not supported by the full Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a political initiative of the party, nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to take back the power of the 'insane drivers' and the 'profits' of utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'shortages' based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in corporate governance councils and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Including ownership funds) to give 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has held a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court with at least one week delayed and raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that might change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems to stand firm.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh stands and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
Concerters wishing to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, conduct a world leader e-mail, make a phone call, or in another significant way generate awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizens Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of 'clickivism', giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million 'actions' have been registered by supporters, which focused on a large number of different goals.
Global Citizen argues that these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that have to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the Group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations on the basis of the actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has been paid or brought together by sponsorship.
The group estimates that so far the funds obtained have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realize their full potential', which has pledged 35 million dollars to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after having received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote to the social injustice that is malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions had been sent asking the UK government to improve the food situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizens website, which was asked "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group replied, "It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes falling and failing.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing this year at the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'block' to hinder Russian energy exports - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington may 'if necessary' take refuge in the Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from coming onto the market, including in the Middle East, explained Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Minister of Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to invited people during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with no profit motive that falters itself as the 'voice of the energy consumption' in the US.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country with only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw its view from the 'inappropriate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, has made Moscow's 'prisoned'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is directed solely by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The American position provoked a response from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Association of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to participate in the Presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she 'considered seriously' to participate in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newsmagazine The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider making myself elected President."
Warren went out against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he's "turning this country in the wrong direction".
"I am worried until the bone to produce what Donald Trump brings about in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for an investigation from the FBI before we vote on it."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters felt that she should not be elected by 2020.
Eighty-five percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand up for election, according to an opinion poll by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of her being elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent before a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with a possible participation in the Presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS of Track Palin at an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son must experience, what he is experiencing now he is back, I understand other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little different, they come back and they get harder, they come back and ask themselves if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other soldiers have given for the homeland."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have made a statement last Friday as 'friend-of-the-hof' to the Washington Court in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Libraries Union made pending in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She is then imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people come who apply for asylum in the US, as countries that know major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, in which it became possible for immigrants without documents on the run for domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Washington D.C.'s Attorney General, said Friday in a statement that the new policy "is ignoring state, federal and international law for decades".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the statement of the 'Friend-of-the-hof'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US is damaging the economy of the US, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provide the necessary workforce'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those fleeing their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief," said Sessions in his announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to do all over the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents came back to their ruined homes and sought in their door-to-door belongings valuable things that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and hospitals have been overcrowded, to the extent that they have not been damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who has suffered a fractured back and shoulder, rest outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe nasal shocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the leftovers of a wall," said Haris to a correspondent of the Associated Press, adding that he was for a wedding with his family in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I didn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and our kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newsmagazine placed an advertisement of four pages in an American daily newspaper, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were encouraged, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump was last referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the US Congress elections of November 6, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere with the US elections marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have constantly imposed higher import prices on each other.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states such as Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By distributing this propaganda, the government of China makes use of the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in a kiosk in the centre of Beijing you will find in vain dissent and you will not see any real reflection of the various opinions the Chinese population has on the difficult economic trajectory, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article", as he said not to which newsmagazine this was.
Due to the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienate female voters just before the interim elections, warn analysts
Now many important Republicans around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him from various accusations of sexual violence, warn analysts that they will suffer a setback, especially among women, during the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this subject have risen enormously and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) to plead for an FBI investigation at the last moment would be enough to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they didn't forget it tomorrow and they didn't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington, D.C. newsmagazine.
On Friday morning, protesters called "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve the candidacy of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, at the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
However, it can still take place, especially among women's voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the President".
Even for Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a setback could be followed if the Republicans pressed through the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or about Kavanaugh taking place in court, but also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with it," makes it clear to the news channel that Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, is a group that helps democrats to be elected.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided over who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority standing in front of the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe in Ford's testimony and that 35 percent believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was certain or probably lying during his testimony while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's suggestion, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown his geniuses to her during a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid from Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee grabbed that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, developers of technology around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not have any conversations with "Facebook and Google about introducing or not a complete transformation that puts all their business models at their head at once".
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post published on Medium Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (van Inrupt) is to supply the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he set up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new web era," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and bearer of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the distinction following the attack at Bellenglice and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sharpshooter four days later, never knowing that he had been given the highest military honor in Britain.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward before he ran only to a field gun and eliminated three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never tap on it, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also made a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Pepa Pig instead
Imagine, you've been awake all night to see a full-length Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
13 battles were reported, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised badly when the transmitter switched to Pepa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's programme on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no more content may be displayed that is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peak the pig," yesss."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said that they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the rematch, we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the transition, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and believe me, these weren't all just as kind.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen again.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic cleaner Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual nature, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Lavene, he said that he had spoken about gay rights to give 'hope' to others.
He also said that the parenting had contributed to his less value in winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months off because of illness.
Apparently as a doubling on the first program by Laverne, Daley told him that during his childhood he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "Until today, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone", so he wouldn't let people down if they finally came to his senses.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Australian Commonwealth Games this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to 'hope' others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has surprised me completely'.
Daley was married last year to the Oscarwinnaar, who is 20 years older than he is, but said that age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much," he participated in his first Olympic Games at fourteen years of age and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same heights and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after receiving the diagnosis brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if she had already received the tickets for London in 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.

"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home audience at the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, who had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and where he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs is available on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th race in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his form back so as not to make a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the biennial event, a record, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furyk for the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising the driving range in an attempt to find out what it is about.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the rough stray balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will come in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newbie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, start well, the game of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Fury has shown confidence in this man, even though he could honestly have been difficult to do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been admitted to the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play just two matches.
I expected more of it, but it's like it is and it's the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never even equaled the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain indestructible influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to get jokes out with people, and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him once in a while last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that a great leap forward can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advantage ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily change into a less comfortable situation.
Deen made his debut in the match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with as Captain Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," Bjorn said, calling off here after he had seen the light of 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a lead of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full effort tomorrow.
Get to work and run the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is this trophy win, and we must continue to focus on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other hand, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on matters in this area.
Tomorrow, a new challenge awaits.
Tomorrow, the individual performance will be discussed, and that is a very different discipline.
It's great to be going out there with a partner if you're doing well, but when you stand alone, your abilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he also needs to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to get started well, as in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have adjusted our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try to magic out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counter-offensive and puts Rory McIlroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
Germany’s new warship again postponed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been employed in 2014 to replace the outdated warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will last at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newsmagazine Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that ordered the marine in 2007 are used to replace the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years behind each other, far away from home ports.
The continuing delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to give Germany the opportunity to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are put into operation, notes Die Zeit.
Last year, the fatal frigate F125 caught the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to operate the vessel and it sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from a serious obesity, which will reduce its performance and limit its ability to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Palatinate' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class that were deployed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, will be a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion compared to the original € 2.2 billion.
The problems which the latest frigates have in their hands are becoming particularly important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the marine actually has "a shortage of usable ships".
The official said that the problem of time has grown as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of business but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research carried out on a estate in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown big-eared bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the estate to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NTS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the cries of the bat and what kind of action does.
Next, a map of the habitat and a report are produced to make a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleep and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, such as flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
Because of their night hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares on land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threeave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much not yet known about bats and therefore the work that we do here and at other locations will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work was carried out, because the possibly unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, possibly eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to stumble or to disturb them, or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species we just don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo charges of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'will promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The peak of Portugal and Juventus is accused of attacking an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is additionally accused of having paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live called Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the accusations were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the trade.
I'm a happy man, and by and by well," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the footballer's room, where he raped her, according to the accusation, anal, as read in the charges filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a '99%' good guy, but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'fearing the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants the scheme to be declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and this summer he left for the Italian giant Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' as car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'careful' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
Clark said, "We need a deal."
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' jobs would cost.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production drop off in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already indicated that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most concerns are the car manufacturers about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37-minute section of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars made on orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there can be unrest at the frontiers that industry believes can lead to delays and deficits in parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the factory in Derbyshire, so let the company know, and in that case the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly aligned to avoid those border controls'.
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is the representative of the trade union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A public spokesperson said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'for another week' while the contest over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between assistants of Trump and Russia and possible obstruction of the President's judicial process.
The question whether Trump is dismissing the deputy attorney-general and thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence has been under way for months now.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump and to dismiss the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumours made that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to dismiss Rosenstein 'please', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a one-week investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, thus delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's chief of staff, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein she said: "There is no date set for that, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for a week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'attractive' TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more question-and-responsibilities than any president for him," she said, without providing any evidence of this: "We've been looking at the figures."
Press conferences will continue to take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask directly the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you have seen us do that often in the past few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the President are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, he made an open and bizarre appearance to the assembled reporters.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to employees of NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish that they continue to work with the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have already indicated their willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be uncertain times for all of you.
I would therefore like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and offer benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is surely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The line baker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, performed an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell there more or less," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie directly oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him with him for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no details known yet about the type/size of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer of Illinois.
He was stunned in a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, so this season he was pitched a total of 18 times.

Foreign buyers will have to go to pay higher blanks when they buy a home in the UK and use the extra proceeds to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this to many earners.
The increase in the emptiness is levied on persons and firms which do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being paid in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The premium, which comes to the top of the present empty space, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, can amount to up to 3%.
In this way, the Ministry of Finance expects to pick up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which means that prices are driven up and it is difficult for starters to get a foothold on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spoke cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the emptiness to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called May to abolish quotas on affordable houses in order to restore the 'household shame' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to expulsion 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the British Dream, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of having a house has ever become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's 'ultimate ambition' to ever be the manager of Scotland.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in third place in League One, on three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership the previous season, St Mirren.
"As a footballer, I already wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B-team and that was the choice," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I often saw my father Schotland playing in Hampden Park with me and it's something that keeps on attracting me.
However, that possibility would come only if I were successful in managing a club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, earlier he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is being measured by "Can I have this club returned to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only doing his career as manager for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says that he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crucifix" he remembered when he took over the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that the management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did pretty well, I deserved pretty well and I knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There are many things you face weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and the pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in summer has increased the income of British pubs who have difficulty to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7% in July, but the revenue in restaurants was 4.8% lower, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business advisory firm, who has collected the figures, said: "For the time being sunshine and the fact that England took longer than expected in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had more turnover of 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurants are now getting even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the turnover of restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubbs and bars aimed at liquor sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at the sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out for a drink.
In pubs and bars under management, alcohol sales were 6.6% higher for the month, while food turnover was 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors in the outsourcing market.
It is no surprise, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover rate of 4.8% year-on-year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators focusing on food and only time will learn whether the more temperate temperatures of August can give the necessary respite."
Total sales growth in the pub and restaurant sectors, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Case Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret account for social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which they hide from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 pupils from secondary schools revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, makes social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to come across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools, found that 40% of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half agreed to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the council of the Scottish athletics world, as a non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports executives to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help control the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been extremely hard work, but I have now completely recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thanks for all the support!"
Advert for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, distributes online opinion
A company that produces breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an advertisement in which nursing mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called the 'most silently portable chest pump in the world', Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has released an ironic advertisement inspired on music videos to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to collapsing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything about it' and 'In case you hadn't noticed, these aren't udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: "Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's."
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that this condons the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected and given to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of delivery" is written in a response.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a feeder (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked: "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarian'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I still breast-feed.
That pumping gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, focused on moms who are collapsing (hard in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being just 'cow'.
This ad is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are collapsing sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly in a diet, allowing women to have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on flasks.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says about this: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing collapsing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the flasks and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of imprisoned migrants has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their own chance to stay in the country by signing up for a child.
This risk has increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must print their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the convention that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsor of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"At 80% of the sponsors' sponsors' or family members are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminals.
We are persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear to the court within one month of the launch of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the sheder
Many of them will be held by a video conference before the court, instead of in person, to plead their application for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may give rise to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger with a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child struggles more often are ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this or to say good-bye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are struggling with.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even when the war in the country was in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also a vice-premier, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions" he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possibly illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country torn by war.
With regard to the refugees, Moulem said that the conditions are favourable to their return and he intended to 'disperse a few Western countries with irrational fears' which keeps most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned down a massive attack on the province of three million people from Syrian troops supported by Russia.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement knows 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be 'cut off'.
Staffan de Mistura, Member of the UN, hopes to convene the first session of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to 'revising the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections by 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely ended by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At present, however, there are no signs of viewing fatigue.
Since 2014, the viewing figures at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' by MSNBC stands at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, responsible for the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor', a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Fair Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he's making me laugh," said Scovell.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all others on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you get to know that you've been watching a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which is talking about the jack of peacock doctrine by Paul Manafort that has cost $15,000 ('a garment full of pride' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
In any case, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's about a reality show is, in part, that he's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily sudden changes (to fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a episode or you have the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside looking at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember we did all those weird shows, not long ago, and that people said "this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money flows from outside in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a recasting of a constituency which requires two sitting representatives to fight for the same seat.
The newly re-divided district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it against another resident representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who knows a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in January that the old districts were unconstitutional ('refugee') for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a fight in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a ninth victory in a well-considered special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China and has abandoned it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognize Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, the minister's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because in 2017, the country received $140 million for American aid for drug control, development and economic support.
The sanctions proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving to the United States.
However, in mid-September some top officials from the government announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and thereby prevented all possible sanctions against El Salvador in advance.
The plan now is for Vice-President Mike Pence to give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the government attaches to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any harsh messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step could be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of the justice of Trump, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on tension between the Trump and Russia campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump must answer for that institution, just as he prepares to address the voters again, and perhaps he should be accountable for a jury in a court of law.
That is a lot of mitten, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There will have to be choices made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938 German officers were ready to carry out a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and Czechoslovakia had supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such curves, and this speeds or slows down the relentless march of democracy.
Americans are currently faced with various of this kind of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the destiny of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that, last year, he had suggested to engage in secret talks with the President and that he had speculated about the President's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says The Times's report is not correct.
"How will we react if the newly applied investigation from the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles before the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was pictured.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Wien
Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a victory on the Austrians puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
The midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first match of the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use results as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good 11" said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that something was going to be won and the match came out with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but seen over the entire game is an equal game probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Thursday's coming is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last race, but if the audience is going to stand by us, I'm sure we can push through and we can get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a bad luck factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave behind the last season and be successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s investigation said that they are talking to their wives about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10% said they had talked to their children about this.
"People would like a member of the family to take care of them, but they do not take the steps needed to make this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your husband(s) and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known well in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in arms: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use your own funds as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal battles when insurance needs to be deployed.
Take care of a full power of health care so that you can identify a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you are no longer able to communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial affairs.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Attach these details to a written plan, so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What drugs are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Man shot several times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air - pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the cover, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "willful act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death toll will continue to rise.
By eliminating the means of communication, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala Regent, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the quake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regent stretching over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The county, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebrations, in particular in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
For the past hundred years, Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis according to the Agency for the Prevention of Indonesia Disasters.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Atjeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a power of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale found one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Regent in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as the people were reminded of the devastations of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami followed, but more than 100 people found death through falling buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-Presidentship, has been arrested for accusation of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offense, he took the phone from her.
Palin is held in custody in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when he was asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A infringements, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a violation of Class B, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of mistreatment in the domestic atmosphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after having linked the violent behaviour of her son to PTSS, that he would have retained his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been switched off while the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake was just next to the centre of Celebes, which is northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, in which eight people have been killed, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the charge, used a hired truck from Home Depot to carry out a hit on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he drove down in October for pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'intentionally' killed the eight victims and inflicted serious physical injuries 'intentionally', according to the declaration of intent in which the death penalty is demanded, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
In both cases, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Week after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'heavy, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is the intentional declaration.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that a case in which the death penalty was demanded occurred in the Southern District of New York.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after two years earlier were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not express any resentment in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, she the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He pleaded not to be guilty of the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in return for a life imprisonment without the possibility of liberation, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
The defense of Sajpov had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MEP says NIEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Today, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a "popular army" during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'heat' of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on March in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage had been Minister Brexit, the UK would be 'er already out'.
But the challenge posed by May in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromises going while this is being attacked by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Co-operators insisted that she will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw "Chequers into the trash man."
He proposed that Farage should be ridden and should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the duty, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers into the trash basket."
In order to clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns also participated on March and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen to me."
In a targeted message for May, she added: "Premières keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'heat' if they wanted to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we're not letting you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: "I want you to betray our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, to put the fire on the skin.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has provided us with the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime Remainers marched through Birmingham and finished this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the creation of this group on weekends.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, joked about the security problems of a Conservative Party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plant 'go to think well' about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "well think about her candidacy for the presidency" after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told of her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who co-chaired the campaign of Trump in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the focal point of speculation that she might be fighting Trump by 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A person present asked her if she would stand in favour of the presidency.
Warren replied that it will be time "for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested After Killing Wayde Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested after killing Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video from the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died of its consequences," told police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has known to have been present at the crime scene, in possession of a gun and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 metres who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started in 10 races last season. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him winning after orders from team
When Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and almost left Hamilton in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits and let Hamilton drive into the crowd's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits one round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action that allowed the Ferrari rider to leave room opposite to space on the inside after a double move in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then the leader of the race for a while, because he stayed with his tire choice and aimed at fast finish, so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
In the end he went in the 44th round to the pits, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best the whole weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me behind.
The team did so best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she did not have to be the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not talk directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he said that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unnatural and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... did you read the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July the letter stating the allegations at Kavanaugh's address was sent to Feinstein by Ford and this was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to deal confidentially with it and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented on it at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further to his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to seize power with all necessary means.
You see the commonness, the unkindness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and get control back," the president said according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs. Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals to lead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scores.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home crew by the side, before Dwyer brought the Giants back to command.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald secured Nielsen with two goals the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe who had to make up for a backlog on Friday night to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three races.
The opening ball of Dwyer came at 3:35 in the fourth minute to an assist of Kendall McFaulll. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants entered the first peace when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He took care of the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have still been missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Güferan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-removing traffic gates of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to ascend safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic gates when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter arranged from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll can rise to the thousands and let the agency for fighting the country's disasters know that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived Sunday in Palu and he said to the military present: "I call on you all to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people dying.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that another man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sank plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon one male passenger is missing.
The airline said that they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had hit water during the landing at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact sequence of events is still unclear for the time being.
The airline and the American Navy both say that the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that he and some others succeeded by wading the water that came to their disposal to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had no severe head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seamen working nearby on a yard also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat before the plane sank further into the 30 - meter - deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have found death in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but none of these concern Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night on which a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a single hour of testimony as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the cell phone records to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left alive.
Rowlett told him that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during his claim to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness bench on Saturday, telling me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to tell the truth when he told him that he was in his truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was " lying because my truck was in Nashville then".
Another inconsistence was that Tellis had told me that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details from his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphop trio wants to question the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that hip hops are alienated from origins with political opinions and identification of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York nanny challenges a couple to the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York nanny challenges a couple to the judge for dismissal for discriminating reasons, after receiving an incorrectly sent text in which the mother complained about 'again such a black'.
The couple deny being a racist and calling the trial "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her apprehension when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, proved to be a Negro when she met her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEEE WEER ZO'N ZWARTE', wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper New York Post, the 'uneasy' Plasco-Flaxman Mrs. Maurice, when she realized her blunder, explained that her former child-wife, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a working day and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple to the court to obtain compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to be in the family, although without a contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that," says Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple bit off with regard to the claim that she is a racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after, by insulting her, they were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists,' said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was an accident?
Your newborn baby?
Don't you dare."
Comparing on the trial with blackmail, Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That is not so sympathetic,' the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, the public's opinion is quick to capitulate the couple on social media, where they are limped for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that the public would not be very interested in a talking bear, revealing newly revealed letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very enjoyable."
She said that her father, who, before being inspired to write the children’s book on a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th birthday of the publication of the book “bittersweet” felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lifelike for him, it seemed almost like a child's performance; you're proud when you haven't done anything for it.
I think he just about experienced Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for the success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was expected not to make it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad's phone call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love your darling so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly became elaborate and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned everything off.
All I could do was sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't pity, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I had to be really big."
In the end, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, stepped into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Roaming women stick messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who are loved by suicide are strong enough to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, Gloucestershire, reports that her son was a promising chef with a grin.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he robbed himself of life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction coming."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all on the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids took out their presents he didn't look at them at all or anything.'
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: "It rips the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he asked for; a study limited in time and size, we might be able to create a little more unity again', said Mr. Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out of each other', in the midst of a firmly anchored patency within the party.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections have already taken place in five weeks, on 6 November and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their men elected in the highest court in the country will be seriously complicated.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI's report is ready?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republicans and 49 democrats are currently in session.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to vote decisively to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of looters in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, explains that there were 1,127 survivors last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for traffickers, are the main factors for the fall.
Pyongyang hasn't responded in public.
The vast majority of the northern Korean looters are ultimately offered the South Korean nationality.
According to Seoul sources, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarised Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the loners to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often violently expels them.
North-South relations, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnated negotiations on democratisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, agreeing in general to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting American sanctions since then.
'Without faith in US action, trust in our national security is also lacking, and under these circumstances there is no first step in unilateral disarmament', says Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Chairman of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, called candidate-judge at the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very empathetic; he sometimes shouted almost and was especially upset when he told about his family and his middle school age.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'grotesque and coordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found Kavanaugh's testimony to the fact that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi says.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to initiate an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
"I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she, as a democrat, was concerned that Kavanaugh will speak against the "Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade" (Law on Payable Health Care) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh referred to questions concerning the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand happy if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just tyrant of months and years of pent - up anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're gonna cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge and who said that she too was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method in which she would cry whenever she got angry. To the one she spoke to, she said, 'You may think I'm sad, because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried further.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially permitted as an expression of anger, because weeping is fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my best-kept memories of a former job, in a man-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was very angry. An older woman, a cool business manager who was a little scared of everyone, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy that they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was engaged in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means that 'catswaad' or 'apenstreken') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not candidate herself.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because the campaign was advanced, she was behind with fundraising, so she vowed she wouldn't be involved if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
"Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her - of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she suffocated.
'They'll have thought I had a nervous breakdown,' reminded Mrs. Schroeder of how the media responded to her.
'They'll have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the US and China can be beneficial for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deaf, and although the battle has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, earlier this year gave the first warning by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were unveiled for 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros) of goods; half of all goods coming from China into the US.
Beijing has taken reprisals every time, most recently by increasing prices from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars to American goods.
China has promised to equalize the US every time, and the world on a second-largest economy probably won't blink quickly.
To allow Washington to bend, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays the smart game, the trade war with the US, China could support positively in the longer term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions which would allow one of the two countries to fall into an economic free fall is actually far more dangerous than the spectators have previously recognized', says Abigail Grace, a research colleague from the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specialised in national security issues aimed at Asia.
Syria 'ready' to have refugees returned, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria stands ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of over seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, declared that conditions in his country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the conditions now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that about six million people live in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' south-west of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish commander Thomas Bjorn reached the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, left his long blow from the tea in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 50-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-class player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play by Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments once with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he selected me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help', said an emulsifier Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The huge pride I feel because I've defeated Tiger Woods. I've been following that guy all the time when I grew up," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level tournaments throughout.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We have made Europe a little more difficult this morning.
We offered opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're regrouping. I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their commander.
You need to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overreacted."
Red glow update: Concentrations take off in the provinces Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the 'Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission' (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in concentrations of red glow in parts of Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the US).
According to the committee, it is reported that fragmentary growth of the red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee Countys.
There are about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County to see spots, but in fewer places than last week.
Rode glead has also been seen in Pasco County.
There have been reports of medium-sized concentrations on the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are reports of respiratory irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwest of Florida, no irritation of the airways has been reported in the last week.
