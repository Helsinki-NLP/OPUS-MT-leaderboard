What are they going to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditorei".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper once "knocked off" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they dominate the notorious snake that has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the row.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era by Mayor Pavel Bém, is rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed that they were doing something in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least that's what they're saying.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a newcomer in Prague's politics," said Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, responding to the test of "patent vocabulary".
But also the Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those that you present to me here that I use over and over again."
"Otherwise, I don't like snake much."
From the vocabulary published by the Tageblatt Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the Congress of the ODSs, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notorientated to the Prag Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "Groots Prager Golfloch", "go to the Conditorei", "Stupid Snacks", "Treasure of the Capital" and "bleaching".
Three Councillors in Prague agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his first participation in the conversation, but did not even take the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the front.
"I don't care how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other about these things, I don't judge them."
"For me, it's important how we understand ourselves within our programs," he said.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký would not have understood in the headline mentioned above that the talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly obtained during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know this more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then not only identified by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý correctly as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found and thereby also what it means to "go into the pastory".
"I think that means going into any Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the mystery solution, knowing that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
But, in agreement with Březina, he tries to draw this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
In fact, there does not seem to be any similarly-populated snake among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there really isn't such a thing with us."
"We call for names, we also use nicknames or nicknames," says the president of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - of his party comrades salope "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried out the name and see there - it works.
Counselor Weinert is kind to the party partners of the "Opa" or less kind to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who made himself aware of himself before the elections through machinations in the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-Figure).
Spitznamen is the only one that allows the social democrats to use the inner-party language.
Hulínský is said not to like it when it is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of Gummüppel-Rechte" is said to mean that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of witches and published a booklet
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are available and have no children.
If one of these women "gets" to witch, it is strictly isolated so that it cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Also young and healthy women remain spared because they help with the work and bring forth children," explains one religious sister the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than one hundred women who were expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason published a brochure to prevent the "witch persecution".
But it's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read", the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out the dilemma of written clarification.
However, witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - she poured them over with petroleum and simply lit them.
The BBC server reported about this incident, among other things.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would have been only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil would be flammable, which would be used for ritual anointings.
And that is, after the group tried to "evil spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of witches supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Freshers of human souls are a danger earlier than they are today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian President has mixed himself thoroughly last year.
"President Yahya Jammah triggered a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as these allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"For this purpose, he called on Shamane from nearby Guinea to help those women and men who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, were violently kidnapped from Gambian villages and brought to the president's farm in Kanilai," stated Amnesty International in her report.
At the farm the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the hired people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of Bakala: He is hot in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the dwellings of his daughters and his son, who is currently exempt from a prison sentence.
All three were increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" precisely the rent.
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rent, the son is to ravage next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there isn't even running hot water in the apartment and heating you have to in a simple carbon furnace," he suffocates with his finger on the new son's lease, to whose signature he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed it," he explained in half and resigned half.
The City Association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7th, when they intend to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man's just waving.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava thus becomes the large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is in place for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market-based rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine in the morning breaking full on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller with it.
"Miete 2011", a special keyboard on the touchscreen lights up.
Short tipped and already the device spits out a number plate.
Hardly did we decipher the number "157" and already pierce it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're on the line.
A little later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room seems not to apply at all to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases offer the most tenants of the 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of RPG to the letterboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in writing an increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch reply after a moment of hesitation when the "Client" escapes as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a crucial topic.
Before the elections, the parliamentary Vice-President from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from the ČSSD, had taken up this subject quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"I want a new floor from them for twenty years."
"Not even a ne k. WC glasses could replace them," the man mentioned at the outset aired himself.
So far, according to the employees, especially pensioners are on the switch to see if they really receive the promised rent reduction, which promises them RPG if they sign the special offer in good time.
In the benefit of a half-reduced February rent, the other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December are also expected to come.
So far, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overburdened by demand.
"From the 360 clients yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rent was here in 2011," the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites, as well as wall panels where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new lease, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not supposed to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least some right.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 remain for food, where should I take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employee will be insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and people are still waiting," she recalls.
According to the regulated rent, most of the Czech Republic ends in the New Year 2011 and RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the RPG Byty company and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants, is the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in housing from the rents taken in between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the Havířov waiting room, some red lighting information is always emerging.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7,50 CZK per square metre and month", read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre", argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments the rent stays at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not drive the rents to a jumpy level, but step by step within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and into thermal insulation.
But, above all, they should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been at the disposal of Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which Ateliers come a number of well-known Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company minikindergarten.
In wisdom, because most of his 90 employees (inners) are in the baby boom age and the company is due to the projectants returning to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of working shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social programme.
The architects have made it easier for them to get their demanding profession and child care under their hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of the management they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational minikindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Programme from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
This funding (CZK 2, 8 million grants) enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be provided and for the duration of 2 years qualified personnel and operations.
After exploiting the means of funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarten 3 further years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, while the Economy Rating company provided active assistance in the processing of applications.
Children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, at the same time only 5 children may be present, but the day changes over several children.
The Kindergarten company is flexibly aligned with the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the Mini Kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the preschool framework programme.
Children not only play here, especially they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool education, by the way they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress does not occur when the children are picked up late from a far away kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employers-employers-related relationships also develop here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, who are family-friendly and through such programs support their personnel marketing.
A bone house is still fascinating after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric estuary, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn-up fish mullets.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the foaming facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only with a closer look that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night, the entire facade still works more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same fluffy lines and veiled shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, and even holes and bars.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the conversion of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
The Casa Batlló rental house, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative home of the reality owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were precisely on its riding board.
However, many other artists and artists also cooperated in the design of the facade.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house in the Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house came from the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "appearing house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint Georg, the patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
A little bit bizarre, she's already had her 45-degree negativity.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at that time and did not let himself be fooled by them.
Before the construction began, he received the appropriate building permit from the city but the details of the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded relief.
The Councillors also encountered, among other things, the fact that construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, changes were no longer made, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the city district's invitation to do so, Josep Batlló submitted an application to approve the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept to interconnect rooms.
The social part can be completely linked by opening the lounge doors and thus a larger society could comfortably chat without having to give up a certain intimacy in the case of more confidential discussions.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two other floors by Gaudí's conversion, except for a new facade.
Gaudí's game is impressive with the light, as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is disguised and the light courts.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor is the most spacious and magnificent apartment made available to the public.
The houseowners only decided on this step in the year and this was on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When one discovered that this is a fairly bearable business, one maintained the visits, yes one extended it also to further common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the building monument is not a pappenstiel, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist exhibits will receive 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bedding? Women have other wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the deck - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously to meet the needs of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattress and rust have to subdue is equally important.
Typical example?
Latex mattresses are not well suited in a weekend house in which they are not regularly heated, as they need much longer to become "hot".
In addition, they are much heavier than normal polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
Because if they do not have enough vent valves in the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture is akin to: So it is not excluded that it forms under its mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high soft layer mattresses are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Because all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"They just need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer) for their worn off shoulders, heels and hips."
"I recommend these also sugar-sick people who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why years ago I bought many ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, as such mattresses include the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it is literally flattered by the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressed, at night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection from decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the size of the mattress you should still add to the body size the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm tall need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm in width, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comfort of half as well as for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, you should still have enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the plum master of the upholsterers and interior furnishings, who has been dedicated for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this topic is also presented in specialist schools.
At a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that mattresses are equal.
Otherwise there is nothing left but to mount the rust at different heights and that is not possible with each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeletons 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be left on the mould layer and fine padded.
"With your hand or with your hand, you can't feel your feathers in any way," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Fully padded beds with mattress and bedding as well as cobbled Siamzwillings have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the connection cannot be washed what is already going on today.
And since one loses between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress is slowly becoming a huge (and stuffed) sieve.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even life guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has its Wen and But.
And therefore a practical advice from dealers: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not spare the hygiene of the washable, retractable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner that you can easily pull off and wash.
Even today, even though mattress covers are usually made with a round zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (very important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially on its own, often like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a hard plate in bed instead of a rustle?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should rather have vent holes (unless already in there) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padded.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable slatted roses with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamlans), always paying rust with a larger latthe number, i.e. 28 and more spring strips, with lordose support in the lumbar spine and the possibility of regulating the latthe hardness.
There are no mattresses with spring skeletons on adjustable slender roses, since they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fastening of the spring strips, which enables you to push the spring strips or even to twist them in such a way as to allow the puncture of the sleeper's shoulder.
An important thing for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area at "lord mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are treated to these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, pointelastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rust with pointelastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed on several points, reducing tension.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow to the right mattress and proper rust, most benefits will be lost again.
Here, too, a fist rule: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm cushion, as it likes, for example, the Scandinavian.
In the side position the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their additions.
The new magic word "Bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, polyurethane foams are used to produce ever more natural oils - such as rizinus and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"In the case of mattresses, Bio means the core of natural materials," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the production of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping.
Here, too, there is a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used for men to absorb the heat and cool the body, the coatings for women have "heating" effects.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm while sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore breathable as commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to scratch.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower value added tax, since they are regarded as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Matratze Duofreeze with the visco foam Memory, which has been set up for 11.990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur is soft with heat, in a cool environment it is fastened again.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing burns, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot polishes, which are intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers, for example, use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing and, as a result, more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, originally designed for the detection of cars, can be a good place for people, which would also be helpful in such cases as it is not long before the trailless disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be larger than a watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror and so they keep looking for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of damaging their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about rump spying, but rather an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," Peter Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that the abuse of such devices can happen in individual cases, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing about it, but we didn't have a case like that yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "chatel" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child cannot carry such a thing, it simply gets rid of his.
"Also very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
"At first, the cell phones raised high expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also disputed whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were more widely used, they would also look for them, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always a step ahead," said the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it was immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, but only a special software is required.
The problem of the current tracking devices is that it is either about devices in stringwood shaft sizes similar to trailers or smaller phones.
There's always the danger of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin von der Macro Weil, we are therefore testing devices that look like normal digital watches in the present day.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker must not at all recognize that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he only notices after a while what the police give a lead in time," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used, as in the car placement.
So the combination of positioning function using the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you can wrap the whole Czech Republic but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of spark plugs, lit with explosives.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometres of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have taken care of 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the company STV Group, a. s. for lipo 40 million crowns.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the general staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 km of ignition cord annually.
According to the investigation by army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES referred to, this statement shows that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vlastimil Picek and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of ignition cords.
This length, by the way, corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these armies would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for training every new professional soldier, two metres of gear is sufficient, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the 225 years already mentioned, even in view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
In doing so, soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
Shut up from underpants.
"I also don't understand why they buy such bulky cords from us."
But that is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer would like to meet," says STV Group sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur with it that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the ignition cord and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not for nothing but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's supply of 244 kilometers," says spokesperson Pejšek, informing us about the position of the defence department's buyers.
Just for comparison: The annual consumption of ignition cords by pyrotechnicians from the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army, has for several years barely exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such quantities of this munitions that they can consume before the end of the period of use.
The safety of pyrotechnics is already a matter of pyrotechnics, as well as the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords.
After all, the Ministry of Defence has huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand heads of Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared themselves for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who responded to MF DNES, the Czech forces are expecting in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old sparks, which they have today bought so "favorably".
To this day I have had contacts which I have gained thanks to the competition.
Lukáš Pytloun has helped to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winners of last year's competition "Little Entrepreneur of the Year" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a movie scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun traveled well.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he created a building house with five apartments.
If you remember that he was a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a brave undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time irritated me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits into the house, which he subsequently gradually converted to pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years of business activity in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was the 4-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tise, which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the Pytloun hotels franchise have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one of last year.
"Great share of this sale of licenses to operate hotels had just the victory in the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", adds Mr Pytloun recognising.
The victory has brought him greater awareness, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say that they did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend to all those who want to make something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win right away, every sighting is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from the contacts and acquaintances, to which otherwise it would not have come at all.
"With some people whom I have met thanks to the competition, I maintain regular business relations to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also a little similar to each of his employees.
And that's where he's got the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I also really see this not only as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a bit in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year when we had it in farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its ambition, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of last year received Karel Žżárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At that time, the jury acknowledged the efforts he made to stamp out a small tool building company in Česká Skalice, making hundreds of millions of turnover.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encourages me, but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," said the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel Žżárský as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists a small workshop for the lease, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he had been employed until then sass and founded his father's own company with a comrade of his father's own to manufacture plastic tubs.
Shortly thereafter, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But only through the success of the mentioned competition and its mediaization has it also entered the consciousness of non-professionals.
"Not only do our customers now see the Farmet brand much more intensively, but also our foreign partners began to be able to cooperate with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žęárský.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of the victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And especially in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which shook the public even less at that time, but especially businesses, has just reached its peak - many companies were forced to cut off their investment projects and limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"The sales went down by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even seize redundancies," says Karel Žřárský.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
But it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in black numbers, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
With one, the company was not willing to cut back on investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we supported our presentation at international trade fairs and acquired key prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žřárský.
Everything is proof that we have overcome the crisis.
The revenues are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish this new winner a great deal of joy at the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Žęárský has arranged.
A survey of opinions that cleans up with unwise rules
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurial competition.
Some foolish rules have already succeeded in getting out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus, more than a third of non-permanent four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official could have called him by two clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the opinion poll.
"In the future, the Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register when checking social security payers," said ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take into account all the regulations and instructions that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and eliminate the senseless.
This is already for the fourth time a business competition organised by the economic newspaper (HN) and enjoying growing popularity in the public.
If last year the three thousand people took part in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activity.
"As regards, for example, the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, in terms of business conditions, the Czech Republic takes 74th place, one in eight places worse compared to the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was declared for the first time in the year and takes place each year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition.
To register, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "antipreis" and allows the public to vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets most votes.
More than a hundred have been notified of this year's opinion poll, 105 meaningless regulations and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finanists" of the competition are provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay toll, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must provide every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the Wenceslas Square in Prague at the beginning of November is part of a happening where people of political and public life also regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small or Medium-sized Enterprises and Commercial Drivers of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs cuddle between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to remove at least thirty paragraphs every year that make business difficult today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create foolish orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, the majority of the businessmen were forced to report in advance to the commercial office of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to drive an exhibition stand to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of an amendment of the Commercial Act.
The obligation, which was given the second largest number of votes in 2007, - the obligation to report to the Employment Office missions of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation, which imposed physiotherapists, was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat moderated by the Ministry of Health this year - the requirement for refrigerators fell.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sport projects
A new feature in this year's fifth anniversary of the competition of the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsive Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea behind this competition is to promote reasonable and fair businesses.
"We want to support those companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile communications company Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal were notified.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically on the subject of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is about disabled people, for example, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which does not promote the creation of formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also provides exemplary care for its health-disabled workers, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which they have been honoured with the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region"; in the Vodafone Competition of the year, it held third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, MiRyz Soft won the accounting company, which introduced, among other things, a flowing and, on average, reduced working time to 35 hours per week, without a relative wage reduction.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company buys mainly from Czech producers, supports citizens' initiatives in its environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recover as much as possible in order to minimise the consequences of our entrepreneurial activities and administration for the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, in turn, is located in the health of its employees and has therefore purchased them into all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, as well as promoting homework for their employees and in corporate actions it uses catering services offered by a local protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in need", which gives concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region is worth mentioning, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, work, skills and holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category of responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the competition were automatically notified to Vodafone Company of the year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser no later than August 15.
Wrong or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsive Company of the Year", but they were not disqualified in the main competition of Vodafone Company of the year."
"A separate application for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Ground Fund - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Pilsen Ground Fund, the anti-corruption police committed arrests in the last days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
It had allegedly tried to manipulate an ongoing public competition to deal with recovery claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition would be a concrete interested party.
This is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for this.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person in a public contest because of the crime of fraudulent acts," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo", who could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in the light of the scarce official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá pointed out that the police had actually taken measures at the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she stated.
According to the public competition, Ms. Černá had the correct name "call for tender for claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, within the framework of the invitation, a higher value of their reimbursement claims due to the transfer than the declared property value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is determined, and then the Land Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the Fund's spokesman.
Luboš G. was obviously available to anyone who had filed for the invitation and since he was himself a legitimate person, since he had purchased a number of claims for reimbursement, he offered a property interest that he withdrew from the competition.
Apparently against a fat set-up.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had all too good contacts with the Pilsner Ground Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Bodenfonds Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for spending land in replacement substitutions that had already been made up of location decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, for example, at the point where the construction of the access magistrals was planned for the Borské pole commercial area.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the Magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give small adorations to the heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
From January onwards, households must not only expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges and for district heating and many places, too, rents are growing.
As of January, families will have to draw several hundred crowns a month more out of the wallet than before.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities one will have to pay up to one tenth more for water supplies and in some places the district heat supplies also cost.
Electricity consumption alone costs households several hundred more per year.
Strong electricity prices have been lowered by all major suppliers, so debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, including from photovoltaic installations.
Gas is only moderately expensive, but this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here too, a few hundred crowns per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are getting more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns per month from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are facing 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation expires in January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to have legal interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children grinning with farts and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, a good whisky, which you stole from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen must be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep out in the hospital repeatedly.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors confronted with similar cases in the admission of clinics to the children's departments.
"Beers or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head physician of the Children's Department at the Central Bohemian Hořovice Hospital.
"Whisky, if it is possible to expel the father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least distance or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The speaker of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him justice.
"The most common thing is distance or room."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Sometimes it was about Slibowitz, which one takes from home," said Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospital are no exception for a long time.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Paediatrics Department of the Hospital Motol, where the ambulances delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12, when she was first supplied with 3.5 percent alcohol in the blood and for this purpose in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't happen to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours at all," the chief doctor marvels.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when pushing with their own squatters is considered one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children do not have a real dependence in the true sense of the word.
"Under alcoholism, a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena can be understood, and that is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is typically characteristic," explains Chief Physician Pelikán.
According to Motol Hospital spokesperson, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were sent to the local Children's and Youth Medicine Department by mid-November.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home by parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment will not be registered.
Apart from the cases where children only drink a bottle of schnapps in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes there are three seasonal amplitudes on which 100 percent are left: Walpurgisnacht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter said for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad witness or for joy on vacation."
"At Walpurgisnacht I have already experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," Dr Pelikán emphasizes.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which result from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be eliminated in the hospital with a fluid-providing infusion of glucose and nutrients missing from the organism.
"They're clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without hurting anything."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, and at least he sometimes destroys the patient's good mood by counting on them the costs that will cost them the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an emergency bed comes well and likes to a few thousand crowns.
"I used this as a means of education once I have directly planned to the children at the visit, what cost their drunkenness and that it can quite happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fat," Dr Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regression procedures in order to demand the parents' costs necessary to cure the drunken children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighters L-159 out of five who exchanged the Czech Ministry of Defense against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft were flown to Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
Until now, they have only been seen at maneuvers or airshows.
This is the flightable two-seat version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over it last week.
When she is physically expeding the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The one-seat L-159 fighter aircraft were, in turn, isolated from long-term aircraft stored, without further investments and investments from the Ministry's department.
"The double-seater L-159T1 have been replaced in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to escape without two-seater fighters, since the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million-year contract with Aero Vodochody on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seater version in May 2009.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to deploying the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty clearly states that the EADS company is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that it should be used to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore a matter of the customer in what way he realizes the matter," Pejšek pointed out.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The trade of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of another aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued an invitation to tender for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then defense office argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased Aero 72 machines, of which they only used 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a legal follow-up.
The European Commission brought an action against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice, which is why it would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of an all-European tender and not even through a single manufacturer's response.
The army has already taken over three planes Casa, the last one is to land on the airport Kbely within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously less likely to have prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this can be done by men to sixty," said the coauthor of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, added Mrs. Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009 she followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
With more than half the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and toe fingers were the same long.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty-87 percent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already at prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Earlier research revealed that testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was known to be fleeting, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer "to date proved to be public".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like the largest part of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow blanket on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways lies mostly stuck snow, the winter attendants were on axle all night long.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked by some accidents from trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno towards Prague.
This is what Novinky said.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometre 91 a truck failed, at kilometre 93 two trucks hit together, and in this accident there were injured.
A few cars are also in the street pit.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The drivers should go straight behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive at km 182 at the village of Kývalka.
That's where a mile-long pole forms.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that happened immediately on the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several centimeter thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Auto-colons form, for example, in the Prosek district, also the road Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team meets.
There are also problems with the railway and airfield.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow avoidance.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
To Vyškov three side roads are completely inaccessible, in the area of Brno there are sometimes snow meadows and in the surroundings of Blansko one is forced to use on some higher roads snowmills.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too you will have to use snow milling.
When they get mobile again, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is recommended in the area of white carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert sprays for nature protection reasons, lies a thick snow blanket of up to five centimeters, led ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of new snow, most in northern Bohemia, fell to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops cutting slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
For the first time in Afghanistan, the American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon known only under their XM-25 code name.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power to their favor.
The new weapon is like a super-precious cannon.
Their projectiles are driven to the target by laser with a safety level of only a few meters.
The special guns of caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed so that they can not only explode at the impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic runway.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who hides behind a barrier - a wall or in the trenches.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new battle rifle is the first infantry weapon to exploit "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is basically like this: he shows the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact point of view, after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he just has to press it off.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"When you press down, the gun picks up and shoots the shot at the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are shifted
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 women and men will move their jobs from the office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be another 100 more jobs of the group that have so far been distributed in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, as well as the large-scale offices in Astro Park would be better able to counter the employees' working methods.
Fujitsu had also been a tenant in Bad Homburg.
Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezerent Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" had been won again.
This is a "great recognition of location".
Fujitsu passed to the city that the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburg mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not have changed anything to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Finally, economic reasons would have been rejected.
Now it's about preventing a long void at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu to date on the town hall square and the neighboring "Little Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa city with the other buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city street was built between the railway station and the town hall, which provided criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously used areas as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then associated with Siemens, covered the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased by the Frankfurt Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group in 2006 together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu conusers call themselves the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, he provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees are Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is moving into Frankfurt-Niederrad, and other subsidiaries at this location are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the 20-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped base - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics has its seat, among other things.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks is becoming more and more in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange reportedly stopped in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks unveiling platform is becoming increasingly under attack.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to the Boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's banner lists, is supposed to stay in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the Free", the disclosure activists announced via short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic depesques in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks went on to say: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they would stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had recruited research, the TV station CNN reported on the Liebermans office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman therefore called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and ruthless approach puts our national security at risk and endangers the world's lives," said a communication from the Partyless Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks Founder Assange, who is being sought by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol's detection list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain stands, the exact place is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as an intruder of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristen Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange was rightly afraid of his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the WikiLeaks founder will stay hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with betrayal and executed.
In Canada, a consultant from head of government Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, a stroke broke out.
The spokesperson of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "spicy and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for newly-known espionage calls for diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we take care of a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs says.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The US government is now fully examining the protection of its databases.
As Special Representative, Russell Travers, Vice Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorist Measures, announced the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that would have become necessary after Wikileak's disclosure of the message reports.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should put them at risk through the WikiLeaks publication.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesperson Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice fellows are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest circulation and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From the Gelataio and from the Gelataio.
The Gelatire, in German somewhat ancient to the Ice Conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaker art.
With a spatula, the Gelataio extracts the ice cream from the cooling counter, cuts it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you will not miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Eis-Universität has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the on-site ice cream.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife crisis, others just venture into the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant and after years wants to make a bit of a personal effort in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive thing is not only good taste, but also the silky gentleness and good consistency.
In his training, Luciano does not forget the cream heap of national and even southern superstructure: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step towards manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano taps the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice cream varieties.
The lecturer is immediately concerned with questions: Can you make ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run freely?
Luciano warns against being led astray from the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarnar flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it collapses in itself, and the customer bites on straight ice grains.
Certain variations of the basic mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes for the taste of ice cream between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white base mass, which turns with eggs into yellow cream and with cocoa powder to form the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the participants are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
The fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - tasteful it is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't necessarily taste more nutritious if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really emphasizes the taste of a Gelato, says Luciano.
Fishing is a task: If Peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano extracts a device by which it determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers measure the olives in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the computer.
Making ice does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only the device for automatic production of the basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice blend is simultaneously cremigated and cooled at minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small pans do not remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo cares about himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized staff mixer is out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until something like this happens."
On-the-fly controller
The European Food Authority, EFSA, was outlawed by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation is now being formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years with the Ilsi lobbyist association.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has made a significant contribution to the Efsa test rules for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The EFSA rules are, in part, identical to the Ilsi position papers and thus bear the manuscript of the industry, which is intended to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It was already the second time that Testbiotech lacks a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking Efsa manager was recently without any conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The Central German Broadcasting System (MDR) had recently revealed links between EU authorities and industrial lobbys, which made the Federal Environment Agency as bright as EU parliamentarians.
However, the EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
One goes back to all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it is stated in an opinion.
The experts who work for EFSA do not demand that they have no contacts with the industry.
But they would have to disclose it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including on risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as Than criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding attempt in animals and the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what makes genetically modified maize on the field, for example," says Then.
Current practice was to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which did not produce reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how should you find them then?" Then Then Then, indictingly asked Then.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
As in the United States, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not involved with corporations.
For companies critical studies would generally not be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood at Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the Tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: in September the excavators were touched and had begun to break off a large piece of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the railway station's billionaire underground.
When it came to the construction stop, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he cut one off, he smoked after cigarette qualm.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the cracks yet.
Stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
The trail of the Stuttgart rocks leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all the people who attacked the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would melt to gravel or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden bundle that once was a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he relates, when in September the newspapers said that he bought the rest of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he spoke to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it ever happened, it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were used again.
About 200 S-21 opponents then participated in one of the 80 kilos of heavy quader on average, unit price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of being able to give him back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had been bought by Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half of them are still in the forest, the rest are sold long ago.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Häuslebauer.
From everywhere they had come and dragged away what trunks and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart rocks of the impact have long been transformed into "mäuerle" or into limitations of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He climbs into his off-road cars, making a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied and quit law, later biology, then he was interested in computers and finally became a stone merchant.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stone stored you.
From all over Germany, he unravels his treasures.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's retarded.
In the snow there are artificially carved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, is warm.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
He shows on a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
Let's go.
"Beautiful Travertin."
At one time, the quadruple belonged to the Tribune of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
All over the snow stones and stories, Cannstatt Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, reddish granite from the Saint Blasia Cathedral, Tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
If Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be cut by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and ox carts, he becomes quite venerable.
"It would be a scandal if you were to do something like that."
He has not become rich, he has not become rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, as well as in the forest stonemethod, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glasswinder and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the restorer.
After that, he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
High- potential talent struggle
There's a reg. And then there's a Buffet.
16 students push around salmon broths, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car builder Volkswagen invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they are supposed to get to know Volkswagen about the car of the future in a kind of competition for ideas.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now entering the close competition and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the auditoriums before they come to the labour market and are re-conquered by others.
And since the universities do not publish any statements about the achievements of their students, they try to identify and bind the exceptional ones in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car group throws around the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber beards and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them paths to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come in contact with industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperation, says Selle, is not unusual.
It was new that so offensively the students were beaten.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates is likely to get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
In particular, they must be commended and especially balanced by highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even greater according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for the audit and consultancy company KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern schnitzel hunt, where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the U.S. this way next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG files and get to know the company.
If you are allowed to join, you will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants flies to the USA.
The guns, according to Dykta, are getting bigger and bigger in the haystacks and stings around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing meeting was too little for us."
For Talentjäger Dykta, the bill seems to be on.
"We still have contacts with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are just ahead of their conclusion and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct boom on campus, small and medium-sized companies are also going to the Pirsch classically at trade fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa at Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, head of staff at Solar Technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stubble knows about young people's problems.
Currently, 35 posts are posted on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy strange positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is by contact with the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, for example the University of Freiberg.
"Professors give evidence that we can do internships or write his diploma work."
More expensive promotions are not recommended for solar specialists.
For this purpose, the company tries to advertise with other advantages for itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"Many times a large group can't offer this," says personnel manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good ascent options are further crucial factors.
Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual Best List of German Employers.
For this purpose, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and are looking at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff Manager Stübe is also looking for a bonus point for jobseekers from placement.
"I think applicants are looking especially for external reviews of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer leads over its own employees," he says.
In the jargon industry, the internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding, is called within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat his people well and identify them with the company, then they would all be recruiting for their employer with friends and acquaintances alone.
"This is like a game of gangs," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
On the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A similar ban has been imposed by the government in Washington - and so its previous plans are finally withdrawn.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited.
This was announced by Minister of Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Triggers for the strict prohibition to apply for at least the next five years are the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, at the pressure of the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf are not yet fully resolved.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A Commission of Inquiry on Obama's behalf will present its findings during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been brought to a standstill following numerous corruption attacks, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative control holes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consultant company - before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also deplores the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billion litres of waste crude oil has destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by theft, corruption, and illegal oil cooks.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't beat yourselves up," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge today before the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to light a boy waving up to the chest in the water with the clams surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water shine, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not to be seen that brown crude oil swams float beneath the surface.
She used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the water draining was completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipeline poured out of quantity of crude oil into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row six hours to get into fish-containing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst affected regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps traversed by riverways, the whole extent of destruction becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motor boat stirs up brown bridges, who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rip like black lacritches out of the ground, sadly leaving single palms hanging their backs.
Bird swirling, as is usual in wetlands, is a vain choice: as soon as the outboard is silent, the former paradise, smelling like a gas station, spreads spastic tranquillity.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari schist: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battled battlefield for decades: over 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded here organized themselves in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to discontinue its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is forbidden to return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the Group is too unstable.
All a few hundred meters of steel can be found in such places as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christbæumchen" are called the heads of drill holes much too tender.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Every time such a drill head breaks apart, Akpobari says, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have flown into the Delta’s ecosystem in 50 years ago: year after year, the amount of oil they forced into the sea at the port of Super Tanker “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Anyone responsible for the continuing eco-GAU is disputed about it.
While sabotage and the organized oil theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see brushing drill heads and leak pipelines as main causer.
Shell imposes much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, and US scientist Richard Steiner threw the Group in 2008: The rate of faults on the lines alone is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like a deserted, oil-smiling workshop under the open air, the mangrove shapes emerge: they are split-naked and lubricated to the neck of oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the grounds, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, Michael explains, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates the pick-up pot through the pipes, later draps at the end of the line of kerosene and finally diesel out.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres a day: "That brings us 34,000 Nairobi" - about 22 dollars.
The Delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low price of diesel with almost 40 Euro-cent per litre can still subsidize the illegal cooks: because they get their raw material for nothing.
It comes from "bunkers" that tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts throughout Niger Delta, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a small part of the temporary intermediate raw material is illegally digested: the lion's share fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and squandering them on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more due to the shifts of the population or to the salmon production mode, is considered purely academic by the activist Akpobari.
"If the oil companies would not be perceived as intruders and they would not have thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, the ratio of Ogoni to Shell was mainly destroyed, but so much that only a withdrawal from the Group would be called into question: "Maybe different nationalities such as the Chinese are more likely to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Highest time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, mainly from the country order, want to benefit - like all Nigerians - from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Detectives discover dangerous building errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
The investigators have discovered a possible building error in the investigation of an emergency machine that could lead to a "catastrophe engine failure".
The Qantas line now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the missing Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November seem to have been far more fortunate than previously: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns of a possible build fault.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an opinion issued by the ATSB Authority on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
These were engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
This is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now launched legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a statement of reasons at an Australian federal court in Sydney, which enables it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, parts were dissolved and the support surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the Superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety problem has been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas machine landed in distress, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380 on the ground.
The Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey pilot is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: almost overnight snow fell all over the country.
There is chaos, trains and flights on many roads.
In car accidents, at least three people died.
Winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowed down during the night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are partly 15 centimeters of thick snow cover.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous operation, but was not finished with the constantly emerging snow.
In addition, violent bows swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) awaits Schleswig-Holstein's Baltic Sea coast from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, snow pollution on motorways and federal roads led to major problems.
According to the Meteomedia unweatherzentrale, in Saxon Switzerland, alarm level was called purple - the highest level at all.
Partly 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to congestion and congestion.
In Thuringia, A4 and A9 were affected by snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and North Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, felled trees on the rails or destroyed overheads and paths are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firemen and rescue workers with woolen blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a spokesperson of the Flight Information Center.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
Winter service was a permanent operation.
Although there are few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still just under 400 field beds available for them.
On many roads accidents occurred already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died at a collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver of the locomotive was easily injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: here, too, a truck was picked up on a train crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing the street with her car near Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have some good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will be already with slight evils.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is haunted by swift and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property in.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters attractive: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized and now the bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes in appeal to a spokesman.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then to back up," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution is thus giving its company headquarters back after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers for 272 million euros from the investors of an own fund in mid-2007 and subsequently thoroughly renovated them.
The energy conversion was limited to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the now renamed Towers of the newspaper to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are once again sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of sorrows about dead mates
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the destroyed miners who were declared dead after several explosions in one mine.
Still the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation is still precarious in the bad luck.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between 17 and 62 years of age were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the unhappiness shaft, but had not discovered a trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island at the shining sunshine.
They're silent for two minutes.
29 tables were placed in honor of the scattered miners, on which helmets, lamps, and the names of the buddies were to be seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were half masted.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the commemorative celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was poured into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration ceremony.
At the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin had also been destroyed.
Rescue workers began to clear a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine are started to cool down, police President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit into the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is retiring with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising" old genre borders.
What audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A caught Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and with almost superhuman forces turns his opponents around in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and has already torn his enemies' guts out of the living body when he has bad moods.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and the other characters can also get to one or two sentences or a few painful cries of death.
Otherwise, it is shuddering and flung in the horrificly beautiful hills of Scotland, which offers the viking world from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinematists with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Beautiful, if a film has multiple target groups, only if it excludes each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but he refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred from the spraying brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die from boredom at the latest when one-eyes for freely interpretable reasons break up with a troops of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and set an eternity in flat and fog before the crew appears to arrive in America and keep silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany did not find a cinema rental and now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially because of the magnificent pictures a pity, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade is hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has earned some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or strenuous action, it's all atmosphere, a film-made Fiebertraum.
And there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and hooks him up with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack very slowly to the throat, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that beats him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy who is faithful to the side of the eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, who eventually becomes a warrior from hell to enemies and temporary allies, possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, perhaps only for the depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, excite, and amazement.
An experience.
Enigmatic Earthworks
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to take an opinion on this - yet it allows checks to be carried out.
At midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quadrant, hidden in a valley that goes off the electricity.
According to a letter from the CIA's U.S. Foreign Intelligence Service from the end of April 2008, the reactor common to the nearby town of El Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the 1950s hardly works.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with unsharpened satellite images.
By computer animation, it intervened where which components of the reactor should have been before destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was standing shortly before commissioning, it was called but not yet fitted with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly more known than then, yes, the riddles have grown rather larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack, that Syria was building a reactor in El Kibar, but hardly saw any evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some secret agents in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "probable reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diploma in summer answered only lapidar, which IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The blast of the alleged "unused military building" made the Syrians quickly sideways and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial suppliers from the time directly after the attack, which is likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to be received on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always tried to never run a secret nuclear program or build a reactor.
Uranium stemmed from Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, after analysis of the particulates, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as has the satellite images.
It also prevents the controllers from carrying out a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the destroyed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is currently in charge of the attack.
The investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "is increasingly becoming a serious problem of credibility for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna admits - finally, there is a serious breach of the nuclear fission treaty in the area over which the IAEA is guarding.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are to be " functionally connected" with the alleged reactor - and different from those that still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which plants they are concerned about, which function they have or what they may appear suspicious of.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internly referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iscandariayah at the IAEA, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and identified a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent out by the US to see military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip of the US secret services.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, that has been transported between the three locations and the quader at the Euphrates material.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, there are plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces were stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the bulkhead remained.
The Salzmine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has examined in 1998 its suitability as a radioactive waste stock, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought her in contact with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the Orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks in the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the inspectors' interest is.
Indian, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had complained a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, about U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into action for a few months, one of the strongest means the Vienna Atomic Authority has to carry out checks.
Although IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this direction: firstly, it needs a majority in the IAEA's Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are far from escalating.
On the other hand, how to think about a diplomat: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directing debut in the summer, there have been troubles.
The script itself has written her, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslim, remains in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested that some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in postal production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN refugee aid agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is himself ambassador of the UN refugee aid agency.
It is not diplomatic - it has already offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they rejected.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not been there, and Jolie's attitude to the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to their organization, the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given her screenplay, has, after a few years, granted a filming license to Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come then anyway.
The young author herself regrets that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked with much effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film on the web, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew themselves in it before the outbreak of war and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a watchman.
What sounds a lot different than the version "Supplements of rape are collapsing in torture."
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only bring peace to the hackers of Hollywood: by putting the script, as so many before, illegally into the net.
Nothing like leaving here.
This evening, it's finally going right around for the Irish.
No sign of sadness.
For this purpose, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans are jolling for joy with cracking loud music, they bump with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the South Irish Cork trembles because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" calls itself the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euros victory prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the retarded computerist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to divert himself from the boring question that the future will bring.
On his plan there is no fun game in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a lot of feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have any work there yet."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, suck her job as event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
One hundred thousand Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, predict experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, an emigration wave is comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, now is once again making tristesses wide.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain about the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has so far only gone uphill.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in the flood.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are also readers letters of young immigrants complaining: "Everything goes down the creek in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will then turn off the light."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future coming up because the government only operates eye-catching and the young people no longer offer prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
They observe how their commilitons hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to positively occupy the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a total service on work abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website show photos surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just pulled up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the credit for his home home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when after a long time, he comes across the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never."
He laughs a bit shy and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept courtyards, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit-funded.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it might go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan considers a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The engineer doesn't like the crying he hears a lot at the moment.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we just feel like an Irishman."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who has gone to England during the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open up and just watch how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he has already been behind him and why shouldn't it work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
One thing is still there that worries him in these days: the celebration on his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might look like a life party.
"Don't forget too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a sidewalk, quite loose, with some friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarometro survey, carried out in 18 countries, was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's September and October surveys.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the severe collapse of last year, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44% of respondents said that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a marked increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
The fact that this took place during the world economic crisis may be that Latin America’s countries only experienced a short recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and has fallen by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the beginning of the survey have many respondents in Latin America seen a greater problem in their country than in unemployment (see Graph 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member became victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market sectors: around 71% of respondents reported over-regionally that the private sector was essential for development, with 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, has made many private companies national.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
An Electoral Slip
Nobody expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts overtook the fears of the electorate, who rushed to the aid of the poor country, far away.
Overcrowded ballots, multiple votes, ballots in the rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Electoral rooms opened with an hour-long delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, strove about looking for an option.
After all, some gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leaders, demanded that the election results be abolished due to a alleged fraud.
All over the country, there were some violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show went on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly bound by the unpopular President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce provisional results on 7 December.
The expected choice of choice is planned for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds only little or no agreement with the voters, explains the electorate to the winner of the election, this could cause problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On the election day many Haitians were hindered by a lack of organisation in voting.
Shortly before the start of the election, approximately 250,000 IDs were not yet distributed, which are needed for election.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same opinion.
Secret in the Middle
In the weeks after your husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you are helping her to re-election next year depends on whether the visible mourning Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also guided economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President and the President to spend the extra revenue on their own behalf.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further destruction.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists were behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (with which one parliamentarian struck another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the president.
The 2010 budget is also valid for the next year, giving the President an even more opportunity to spend money on her own behalf.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage claims from the trade unions - are worth almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Population INDEC, which subsequently provided the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate course now?
She called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, perhaps Cristina Fernández would like to return financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securitiesholders who had rejected the country's previous debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer price index, which would seem to be the first step towards the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the end of her term of office.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which largely has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was shown to her will be removed.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to silently withdraw many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, were elected to elect mayors and city councils in the five districts. This is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is herself a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has for the first time changed the relationship with China’s motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) presents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the voting share of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into town councils together with the KMT.
During the elections, there were the usual incidents in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with crane makers, flag-swinging mass moves and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of KMT, spoke on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man shot him out of the crowd into the face, he was wounded and killed by an outside observer.
Bizarre references are not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or fight with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP's leader, has affected the election and has turned the DPP into a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the Government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoided too much scaring the anti-Chinese feelings.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, it would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese people are in favour of its China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a retailer to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration. But the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has since been reinvented.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he intervened vehemently for absolute independence.
But under Tai's regentship, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fought for the voices of professionals and young people.
Tsai was given great support as President of the DPP, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that it is also able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forging as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this requires discussion without any doubt.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas' preliminary approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP’s candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even called upon Pragmatist Su to abandon the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is hard to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undertake its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scarcity between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only favours a re-accuracy in a limited way.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people consider economic cooperation with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no going back".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear on the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was surprisingly nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in the jazz scene in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums in the broad public prior to the release of the album with which he was known.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her swinging voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes closest in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums.
Among the competitors Iyers are "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, where otherwise albums from Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category Großgruppe. He thus opposes the Billy Child's Ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Octett, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is given by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, the "Lulu" was nominated by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt für Symphonie Nr. 4, Daugherty für "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze für "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg für "Graffiti" und Shchedrin für "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on 4 January at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestra presentation category for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Aktuex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Klassik-Crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Critics urged the project to promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission of Wednesday evening, the new religious centre will comply with local regulations and become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to the press enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," said one comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of terror attacks on New York City on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wished for a larger and better place than the camp they have rented together with a manufacturer for water filter facilities.
The new 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque is supposed to have two minarettes and to be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the 17500 m2 property on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial nest, which can live from arsenic among others, opens up new opportunities for new life forms on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is, in their view, a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered to be essential to life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists discovered, the bacterium in the Californian Mono Lake is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"It's a question of what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the Arizona State University report.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act from the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not strictly defined," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another one," said Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenal content.
As arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to its chemical similarity to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It reaches into our biochemical system, where it almost smears everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers put the bacterium GFAJ-1 out of an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based life-form can occur naturally, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on which the arsen occurs more often.
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has not been a working example.
Arsen occurred more often in the early years of the earth, she says, so science assumed that early life forms used it.
"That gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early age of Earth," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen from a Bellflower motel were found from Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were accommodated in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are well on," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not provide any precise information about the location of the dogs nor the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation's still running."
"We don't want to say any more," Whitmore explains.
"We're following some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district zoo in Downey.
The sheriff's representatives found the van and the dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed according to official statements.
However, the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek on behalf of their Japanese owners this week, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace was to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The fattest Akitas and Corgis remained in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their cars stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised anyone who could give a hint of the corgis, a finder’s pay. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder's pay will be paid.
The lion roars again after the MGM restructuring has been approved by the court
After 18 months of turbulence and insecurity, MGM finally got green light for a fresh start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "prepared" gallery plan to eliminate the debts of $5 billion and pave the way for new films and television shows to the 86-year-old entertainment company.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be the head executive of the somewhat de-spected studio.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually come into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself pays $75 million, is leading the company. The funding is expected to stand until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management, which fought with interest payments of $300 million a year, solve their financial problems.
In August, the Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial services and pay out more than 140 studio glasses took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything began from the beginning when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid to manage the company monthly $375,000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio only released one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films for "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be made under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the final negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a whale mart, a toy "R" Us and a BJ's wholesale club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and cost at the same time a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys with their own website appear, there is a wider offer on the most well-known of this kind, Webkins and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cells-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plus figures as big as guinea pigs singing a note when you press on their stomach.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, by multiple pressing you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Note: If you have started pressing once, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sound and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon's walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can make a car ride an hour of teaching, with a better knower with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you do not want to entrust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, bright screen after Leapfrog’s first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there are Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8) . The five blocks are not larger than a strikewood box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about to put the blocks together before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores on your own after the offer, Webkins and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online game in the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2' Mix 'N Match character package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
These can be roller shoes or a puffer.
The latest head cell-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a lunatic garden from Klötzen.
And he's holding out a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, examined his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and mutated voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their hanging on violence - to impress the viewers.
"Just stand!"
"Click straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely outgrown the teen age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers were tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four proper hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"On average, they look like me," says Mr. Tang.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low starring: According to reports, in 2009, 50 officials surrounded an improperly positioned imbued car and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a district of Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police strips. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, their good character and their youth.
They're supposed to give the grosser police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad picture the Chinese have of these city commands.
That's right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are permitted to enforce urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely show a different image.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone, as they made a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a Beijing officials training manual was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street merchants.
"Chengguan scares the government," Parliamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The paper demanded a "real thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are the current approach for clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or just serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were searched with good figure and "harmonious facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too strenuous.
"The most important thing is her image," stated an anonymous district official at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Beautiful Chengguan are like vases of flowers," he said, adding, "but in addition they have other duties".
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to include this description,
However, admitted that in China, the size requirements in job advertisements for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether it is equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lambs or bucklings here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pies and a well formed mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so great a value is placed on her appearance.
"Do you find me looking sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than just to turn dealers through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street merchants who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already told you this so many times!" explains Mrs. Xu, a merchant who had fled on foot, temporarily leaving his noodle kitchen fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20 who study sales in leisure.
"All the routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate merchant goods like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public assaults which are often exposed to Chinese officials.
This year hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, marched after the rumors, Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured during the night, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the women officials were patrolling this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers with a fierce face paved the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male strip coordinator, stayed behind. He turned his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going to be open-minded."
"But sometimes also physically," explains Mr. Li sober.

Public Prosecutor Will Not Blame Senator Ensign
Senator John Ensign has been acquitted by prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice from the accusations made against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying job, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most severe lawsuit against Senator Ensign, Republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal that struck nationally and made his career a damper, he was considered a potential presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was pleased about the verdict after one year's investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were terminated and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had ignored the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents that were first published in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituents, was helping to purchase lucrative orders to his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during an Ensign election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was still in Ensign's election team recently, he was not allowed to do lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friends before the affair, was against the so-called prohibition of turning door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "everything seems to be about a deal and the violation of the turning door statues," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients in the government's visa.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the ministry seemed to be very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats that were persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
State attorneys "are obviously horrific," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in U.S. parliaments and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This means, in principle, that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from an attorney on Monday and another on the next day when he was told that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense officer had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable with going to the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much has been said: We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to terminate the investigations for a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had been violated by the Federal Election Act.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyist.
An e-mail dated December 2008 shows that, after Mr. Hampton continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he "knocked" at the Ministry of the Interior for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also present at lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had stopped Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When last year, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in fourth place in the Republican ranks.
After he hadn't noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was pursuing a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his press spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and put an end to his investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tipping into the walls in the courtroom.
In the minute, via Twitter, they sent their reports on cruel testimony.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and bed chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of having killed three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's verdict on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
But Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications to the court, which explain the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that intensive reporting on the process - even through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has brought about a "circus atmosphere" and so widespread, immediate penetration of insidious details, so that the jury was unduly influenced by public disarmament.
This opposition could lead the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I think it really is a danger if the insertion of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's chief defender.
The President-in-Office, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Chamber Court, briefly and promptly rejected last week's appeals by decision when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on famous and notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an Osteopath from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "Flee from it" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court claims that Mr. Hayes' convictions half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of the case Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes that are persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she is arbitrarily hanged.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who present the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss years and thus delay judgment.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have already been condemned when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel murder photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their cultivators, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with abhorrence.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge had wrongly exchanged a jury who was a critic of the prosecutor's office and that he had unduly pressured the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors weren't isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of the detailed report on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a lawsuit they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously re-enacted the flames of emotions over the case.
"One such daily crowd of media sufferers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "have not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even throughout the country."
Its focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were more invigorating than reports that were being reported more slowly was a technology-eminent view that hampered the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes were required by the courts to adapt.
Mr. Hayers' lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard was revoked on the basis of the report and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Is courtesy able to connect the separation?
After a campaign of chimpwords and negativity this week little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues with which one had to deal during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government in which decisions are no longer taken.
After all that one hears, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party score.
The President's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction creates mutual respect over a period of months, which conceals the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
That's hardly enough to say it was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is called for, while one tries itself to weigh the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of voters after a new party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep that one could expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election Washington voted mild for at least a short time.
"No question, the soundfall has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections bring about partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "Lame Duck Session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to obtain some or even all, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is to be expected with regard to the increased unemployment benefits, even if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferential tax cuts for the rich, while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these questions during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START contract.
But William Glaston of Brookings Insituation warns that successful cooperation on urgent questions of the lame duck session" must not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformism is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as an advance, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were responsible for their education.
As concerned the Republican leaders may also be that they are too high in poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to lower government spending and put out health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pressed so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 out of 18 votes to make their plan an official recommendation and they fight very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the board, as in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes and health systems, followed later by a phase of larger two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and find the compromise.
In fact, this may be an optimistic view.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 see themselves as a prelude to a much wider 2012 election.
In this respect, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
On both sides, however, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that are still separated from each other.
Passed US document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes on to the Kremlin some of the bribes and the patronage it collects. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service are extorting high protection fees so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part from the money that the leaders move upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose name was edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption charges over years, and he has won numerous accusations against such accusations.
In September he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary that suggests he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has led to polls.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow Government with crime has led some to call them "disturbed" and to conclude that the government acts more like a cloptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "Dach" or protection), which extends over the police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Public Prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and militia are at second level."
"Recently, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city offers no help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
One source, that is, "declared that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - due to some pretext.
Medvedev spoke several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he had made little progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, so estimated Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks at position 154 of a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed as "most corrupt" by "minimumly corrupt".)
The disclosure of the American message's memo, which happened after Moscow's late evening, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted angryly to the disclosure that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor of internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to be done with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and rolling walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, the infrastructure developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-time followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook, which for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia sentenced for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Slange Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, aggravated their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia's society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, Head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed, or they died of disease, revision, or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement sponsored by the UN led in 1993 to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to cross over to the government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although some of the Khmer Rouge’s elite officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng,
"They are anchored in the Utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Lang Veng before he settled in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on In the Chaem, 64 years, which had been district chefin during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she told the editors of the Cambodian Documentation Centre that they had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project in which thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening in the Chaem from work on the fields came back to her wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, the Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court order her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, war would be here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer Times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that everything can be understood."
The center created the first school book on the Khmer Rouge approved by the government, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages via the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, a road covered with rusty sheet roof leads to a rectangle covered with plastic waste.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire heap.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the roadside, said she doesn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will leave a bush of ripe bananas - hoping he'll bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect further weapons-resistant uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarus Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But the U.S. government official told Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been signed with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-resistant uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations" from April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear safety summit (of 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important and important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How do highly enriched uranium keep hundreds of Kilos, which is basic weapons capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, say official.
It has been loaded into a special train that has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official aircraft.
The U.S. government pays 14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated in order to build trust, which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on the global reduction of danger.
The James Martin Center for Non-proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-like uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus intends to dissolve its stock by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram from the U.S.A. Ambassador to Madrid.
This reflects the documents unveiled by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that former Deputy Governor María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid for human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "hit Zapatero in the distance" and affirmed that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objection to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", not to be "unprepared surprised", reports Aguirre per cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of judges."
In January 2007 the prosecutor Vicente González informed him that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defense via the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," said the Ambassador after a discussion with the Public Prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly operate between governments," laments Aguirre.
At a lunch time in March 2007, when Ambassador Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba and Spanish Minister of the Interior commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely concerned about their independence and were doing what they deem appropriate", he instructed his employees to "absorbed rhetorical comments to let the tension fade."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt the fact that the government of Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, will be capitalized, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States," he points out.
The child killer confesses that she has complained on the Internet about the "maturity" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she brings up from a small point of view, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The communications are dated 2008.
To understand this, one must know her life of love, which reconstructs the daily ABC on the basis of the testimony of her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman took up a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, she became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex-wife never let him perform a DNA analysis.
She soon entered into a different relationship.
The choice was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around in the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But it can be concluded from the content of their news that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him, he liked it, but now he realizes, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and to be able to do whatever he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she speaks of her return to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine myself at work on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will bring her firstborn when everything goes well.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone other than my mother", a dubious intention if one considers their bad relationship.
In July there will be another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th.
"On the one hand, Cesar is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place likes him a little, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She speaks of moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the baby girl."
On 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. If you see, if he wants to, he'll find me like that."
On the 30th: "The boy is doing well. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer".
"Terror a la galga (title)".
The last man who lived with her, a dedicated hunting overseer, explains that he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to the Palma provincial prison yesterday from the Center for Prisoners in Menorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she did not intend to inflict the small damage."
Previously, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
Defence and prosecutors requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
According to the important vote and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking ahead or not at the parliamentary elections. Your expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the Catalonia elections.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this number in the 2006 regional elections was only 316,222.
Last Sunday the PPC scored 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP's electorate - were to stop, the PP analysts predicted that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congress members, while also CiU four (it has now gained 10) and PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (of 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party analysis, the ERC would lose a Member - at present it has three - while ICV would keep its MPs or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date will come with the municipal elections in May 2011. Also, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the balance to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city’s administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists will neither gain a majority nor be able to rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debacle, it is not sufficient for this party to lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, where it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's transformation. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has also seen a significant increase.
Currently, PP is represented in 34 city administrations in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida with thousands of travel passes
Except for the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers of the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "movement to the liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, which demanded 106 deaths in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure him that with the "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaidas forgery machine has been "weakened" worldwide and "so their ability to act".
The researchers assume that during the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could pass the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The revealed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units, besides the Thai investigation bodies, have also been involved in the investigation. It is not excluded that in the EU area, in the coming days, there will be similar attacks to those carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babathunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Syriananlaya Kijbumung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - especially tourists stole passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the name of men aged 25 to 45 and still had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In investigation circles it is underlined that so far no connections between the prisoners in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay could be established, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the stolen and then falsified passports in Spain.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several days before the assassination of Catalonia from a money transfer company, several thousand dollars had been sent, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid mobile phones cards, which were later used by the members of the "command", who put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police confiscated extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present his terms of office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already held during the election campaign and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People’s Party turned with security to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable. For the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is obliged to have at least one of the opposition parties present at the vote at his office.
The future alliances that regionalists want to enter the Congress in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible Entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
With regard to the PPC's party president, it calls for "all discourses affecting the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and for an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU is even seeking to make a referendum in the back.
Both political leaders mean that they want to reduce the built-up political apparatus of regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the negotiations for the accession of Mas.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) - and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidartat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not exclude that their caretaker killed over eleven elderly people
The people responsible for the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they revealed the damage to the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - of the institution.
Joan Sala, the head of the nursing home, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, came to court and announced that "La Caritat would like to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the right and our duty of liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only suffer a loss of social esteem because it had not determined the criminal acts of the caretaker in time, but now also pay a high sum of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to kill.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat totally denied this point and stated that "remaining measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat's lawyer added that there was "no evidence of negligent actions by a person other than the defendant in the dispute."
The "death angel" who had already been baptized yesterday 11 murders and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that he murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had used a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat said that access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail were used by the caretaker in six out of nine crimes committed to relieve the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will reveal whether Vila lies and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them from the inside by offering them a bleaching pool, as he had done in the confession of three women whom he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, no faith is given to the nurse’s statements, not even in terms of the number of known murders that could be much more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila made very different statements before the court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say that they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
European Central Bank threats (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned, "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The euro periphery's risks have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has scarcely raised any concerns.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which is recovering to the extent in which it collapses, but due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the end of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as it was ineffective, as well as for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and maintain quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect that the program will continue to purchase bonds and will issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if it is stubbornly insisted that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, which confirmed that the bank would not consider buying government debt securities and that the markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and durable.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said to have already bought a lot with which she provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State asset management accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
However, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of markets according to Trichets.
In Ireland the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million short-term and possible another 15 000. There is time until February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalised.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem of stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to be given parliamentary approval to its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unity has been asked to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's ninth symphony.
Yesterday, the President of the Spanish Government presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, government deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explain why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to indebtedness.
For Spain, the request for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without delay.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now it counts not only being, but also appearance."
Courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen will, at the request of his children, celebrate the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro societies, does not drain.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate gulp, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority in order to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing legal measures for a new legal chapter in their fight for control of a part of the corporate group.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not seem to be willing to yield in his case to control the organs of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January of this year, which has already been registered as being challenged in the Commercial Register.
The Society's meeting of El Enebro, convened by the Madrid Commercial Court's Judge No. 2 for the 16th, triggered a new thunderstorm in the Álvarez family's lap.
The call of the Judge for the contemplation of the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the Society’s Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "disputed means by the applicants - their five children - to have the congregation declared void of 18 January, by means of legal scepticism, fraud and abuse of law", as official speakers explain.
This argumentation is the basis for the opposition of the congregation in retrospect, in order to declare it "absolutely invalid".
In June, the same protagonists who shudder in discreet silence tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting on the judicial path.
With El Enebro - the asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez's seven children controls 100 percent of the capital.
In contrast, according to family records, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
That is the actual background to the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the proceedings for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history in this sophisticated universe is characterized by the speed of surprises and successes.
In the beginning, no one gave attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, the final track was all on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without wanting to reduce the ability of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the strength of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company brought to the market in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This PLM software program was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A true reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains that using this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that can be found on the races and tests.
Russwurm concludes that in 1992 ten technicians worked in the racing stations, which were able to introduce no more than three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bulls team, 180 highly qualified young people are employed today. With high-performance IT systems, they perform analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred to reality within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula One team is allowed to spend for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built his high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a place 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts in the service of his participation on the race tracks, other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their awareness is zero.
Steve Nevey, Chief of Technology at the plant, stressed that five years ago, it was possible to say that the progress in the R&E field for racing cars contributed 50 percent to victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed, and the technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty separate stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy president of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned as an example the converted store at Gran Vía in Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working together for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of them in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Vice-Chairman, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, assured us that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch), and in Europe all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales point network intended "to optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and after, and even packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of the HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a link to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'claw' its rivals in three years
The Executive Board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a break-in of interest rates which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - an existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of a million private customers - 700 000, if you subtract the customers who will lose the bank - which is the big challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has given more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Its market share in private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual financial statements.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as all the plans of the banks have been confused by the financial crisis worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima guideline four years ago, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
In the case of a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficulty" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only be "slow" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years "to create work" - essential for the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - punishing the interest rate margins - will fail, the risk increases that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions for the maintenance of liquidity are already being offset for declining profit margins to the price of loans.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto had already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (see Cinco Días, 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the state "to increase fees", but "within a framework influenced by competition".
Sabadell's guide plan is based on organic growth, even if the group does not exclude corporate business as always.
Not for nothing does he assure that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He stressed that the demand for capital is "increasing" at the moment and did not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions would break down in red figures.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in the case of quota increases.
After ensuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of markets, he denied the argument of some bankers who already predicted a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be done, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing could be achieved through repo transactions and thus overcome the crisis.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of the savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that there could be a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase. They kept the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, did not ensure that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed, but the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica Group cannot be regarded as a second round, but rather as adaptations."
"The most important part is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, who has supported all operations strongly."
In a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we need to be satisfied with the timely outcome, which in earlier times, not now, was established in the context of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 each with 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there would be a number of inconsistencies about the slowness of the process that revealed unease and insensibility," because "Banco de España urges us to conclude before the end of the year in due time."
Yesterday, Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured Spain that it had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and that it was possible to "maybe" the whole world and added that those who doubted that they were doing so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic cycle, we must not worry about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time conditions exist for the entire European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 Euro support for unemployed persons who do not receive unemployment benefit, including the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former President Felipe González, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany is taking on a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which, with the maintenance of the old traditions, largely conflicts with its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, three possible reasons for the crisis are being speculated in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although this sounds more like science fiction - is supported by a large majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Third parties: A redesign of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that violate the requirements; possibly the setting up of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been in place for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew a constitutional reform in order to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of a conflict between what Germany considered necessary (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At that time it was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable a country to be saved and, at the same time, to oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and all the following.
But her proposal, albeit somewhat sweet, has been accepted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It says to everyone that, even if some unpopular measures need to be taken now, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro as of this date.
In 2013, the year of birth of a new currency area in which the beneficiary countries are severely penalised will be forced to declare themselves insolvent and in this case the private sector will have to take over part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a tough growth course, with high savings and investment rates, measurement of consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on indebtedness and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as mentioned by Spain in booming times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we wouldn't mind not understanding it.
It is not just about driving down the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheating ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will change to more tranquillity.
And that we will take advantage of the possibilities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of order in his own home is ready for its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like it would change anything.
Among the possibilities considered is that we would not have to leave the euro area fully blocked with a small number of serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and control
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventive spirit, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
The exclusion of two real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed about whether it was an unsportsful act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before gambling (their team had already won clearly) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the required penalty at the next league against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without any cards.
Finally, the UEFA's Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach José Mourinho with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this type of sport - rules.
Part of the debate on the case presented goes back to the fact that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who in his hymn presented nobleness and honor and punished his players for similar incidents on other occasions) played the main role in this, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the Statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a set of rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to bypass its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused by the spirit of sports should be investigated.
The spirit of sport defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the opposing players from taking an unjustified advantage of the opposing team. This was not the case either.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by mistake or regulation, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players were waiting and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the defendants drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was neither placed in any less favorable position nor the advantages of the played game were heated because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club doesn't have these players.
The advantage is clearly that the players begin the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also leave. Furthermore, the players get a sanction with this approach and move into the second card cycle, in which they leave with a card accumulation less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
In the end, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sports, which includes strategic decisions in order to derive maximum benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of control), they wanted to choose when they submitted to them.
They made a strategic decision to avoid or escape punishment.
Although the boundary between invention and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventive step.
I have the impression that the polemics came from two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The damage inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than, rather, aesthetic.
Offer offensive to the customer for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that will bring oxygen to the Barcelona restaurant and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they will trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of December 13th, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top customers (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies discontinued group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are demanded, the president of the Barcelona restaurant ngremium, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
So far, the representative of the umbrella organisation dares not predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think it over and over before they book."
"They would like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he emphasises.
The business will go well with those who "provide quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are most in demand.
In a survey in several central restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 leads the suppliers to collapse.
The Soteras group said that the demand for less than 30 euros would be boomed this Friday. The group has adapted its menus of complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which heads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the revenue has bloomed again since the second quarter and good, though for a few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business.
The sources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than price hit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts sprinkling, which is why the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the group dinners are again in the upswing.
On the sides of the Fécasarm umbrella association (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the Vice-President, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are generally quite "living" although customers "beat out a maximum".
The fun of celebrating, however, did not go down, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
The disclosures of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by Wikileaks web portal, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington has raised.
On the verge of clarifying and juicy details, which offer the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between both countries in matters of nuclear safety is not strengthened but, on the contrary, is "abstaining" and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "for a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the unique nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but that their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are included by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the Taliban-affected area, the probable distribution of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of persons involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered by the US alone, but also by Russia as an extreme and reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan has to hire strictly religious nuclear security personnel; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American colleagues.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that the cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation is failing and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" explains: "There is often no transparency; we receive no answers or they are rejected to help offers."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the state secret service for South Asia, affirms that "in spite of the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit of the Supreme Commander, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear" the person responsible, that "Pakistan's army has stopped its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a senior controller for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning on the persecution and detection of Assange.
All that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" on Assange's "invention and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australians have to face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, says, "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On 20th, the International Police Department, based in Lyon (France), issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority of the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, "to establish and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organization's statements, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter of arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is probably staying.
Assange's attorneys, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for the departure from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor who was granted the appropriate approval with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin.
"This is like hunting, not like a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is teasing for her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview to the Head of Time magazine via Skype from an undetermined place. During the conversation he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "a ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he explained to CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior controller for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt of the President of Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chairing the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to confiscate their money and to persecute anyone who supports it or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever has sent through information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not executed is an own too mild punishment," he explained to sender Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC with a twinkling of eyes
The Republican leader shall allow the Party to vote in secret on its continued office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the ranks of ERC for the longest time in an internal turmoil following the loss of 11 Members and half of the electorate's votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and he will not have the same head-wreck as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a twin eye, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
At the beginning yesterday, it was announced that the more than 200 regional councillors of ERC could speak secretly about their remaining in office.
With ballots, not with an upright hand.
If the charodists wanted to miss the president's penitentiary, they could do this without having to fear repressive acts.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division as well as that of subjugation among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the voices plus one, and he added without indicating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The locals call for more from the President than for the party's office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the highest body of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree a plan of action with the Executive Board from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be submitted to the Council on 18 December.
Their intention is to protect Puigcercós. In return, this is supposed to promise to put forward the Congress in autumn 2011, which the party's point of view already considers a fact.
The party president of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" harms stability and once and for all, he strives to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, signed by Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog, is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party president was supported "in exchange against different goals".
He listed five of them, two of them in the foreground.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the Board of Directors, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great novelty.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should give up the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
In this way, he condemned a reform of the Statutes, which would allow Congresses to hold with elected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which was already fighting for it at the last two congresses, is as obsessed.
In fact, at the inaugural assembly of 2008, the party leadership was commissioned to review the general assembly principle at a congress that should deal with the reforming of the Statutes.
This date is still awaited, as the internal uprising of recent years has not been advisable to address this issue.
Now that the critical sectors are not in the mood, the time may have come to reopen and close this matter forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO, four cases were reported in México less than 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to MILENIO México figures, that is four less than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year we come to a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organized crime.
In the case of San Diego de los Pås Cuexcontitlán, a place in Toluca, emerges.
The subject had at least three shots of firearms, the gunshot was given to his head and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day a person's body was found in the trunk of a vehicle stationed on the street of Mixtecas in the settlement of Santa Cruz Acatlán of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, on the early morning, farm workers found a body with torture marks and at least three deadly shots in the chest of the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
In addition to the body, a message probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana was found.
One day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots after leaving his house to do his job as a garbage truck.
On the seventh of November, two 30-year-olds ended up in the head of San Pedro Xaloxtoc village of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro a man's body with the gunshot in the forehead was found on a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a cartridge shell shot with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the waste water channel of the settlement Playa Golondrina.
The emergency service looked for the rest of the body parts, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán informed of the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorada. The hands were tied together backwards and the head was connected.
The man had a wound that touched his neck from the shot of a firearm.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been killed, covered in ceilings and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle stationed on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda of the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two murder threats were found.
A day later a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On 17th, two dead women covered in ceilings were discovered in the village of Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, a man's body wrapped in a yellow-blue ceiling was probably called Mario Ríos, according to the news that his murderers left behind him.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, a woman's lifeless body was found with bullets of firearms in her neck.
On the woman's skin tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with appropriate illustrations were discovered.
In the last half of the month, in the municipality of Zinacantepec, next to a vehicle, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with tape, were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Against the body was a news probably signed by a criminal organization, which said: "This happens to those who don't join."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to the hands and feet with torture marks were found inside a taxi station located behind the San Agustín settlement’s judicial centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and put in black plastic bags, and there was a communication. The second had been tortured and found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases
China's representative stated at COP16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offering to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
During his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured his country that it would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He claimed that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included targets for reducing emissions of gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the energy saving objectives, effective energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he has already undertaken or completed several years of plans, both those financed by the Chinese government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the program for the effective use of energy introduced over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
It also runs a project at provincial level on climate change, another to exchange traditional light bulbs through energy savings and another to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, scientific government advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than generally accepted.
He showed that greenhouse gas emissions per capita in China account for six tonnes per person, while in the United States there are 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine-percent total contribution to pollution.
It also made unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent over the last five years and is expected to happen further by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panist party president had the right to turn to the National Commission of Ordinance and to demand what the right was for him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former President of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right was for him.
In an interview which took place before the Board of Appeal of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the State, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the order commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to turn to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance with presidential candidates never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Accion Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the 4th and 5th December, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a subject that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a precedent for the municipal elections, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we don't fear internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman, the Accion Nacional, for the next three years. Therefore, he would hand over the staff "to those who would determine the Council."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to transfer to each of the five chairmen the office of the party."
He predicted that the upturn of the party in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it was not time to think of 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and observe it throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in it and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When he was asked about PRI's criticism of Felipe Calderón for his course of disciplining within his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, should they finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could make expressions like those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on mouth and even less a censorship.
Obama works in Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
The President Barack Obama today supported nationwide mobilisation to support the Dream Act - the law on the legalisation of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His short communication contains a cyber link to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to come in contact with their senators, with the exception of the fact that the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 republican senators threatened to block all vote for any law, except the extension of tax reductions from the time of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could have an impact on the coordination of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Commenting on the blockages of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, the Presidential Speaker Robert Gibbs said he believed that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set up for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then we can plan the outcome of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote to end the debate" so that the Dream Act - Act, with which the initiative to legislate undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old during the last five years of life in this country and are enrolled in a higher educational institution or army.
But the defenders of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organisations of the supporters of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, the Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, if other democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side.
Among the most converted Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who spoke out for the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your fingers in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The taste of the language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los plagas de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "takes us into trouble", the Argentine writer sweetly pointed to the audience, which was composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this Marisol Shultz-moderated round table, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz later marked it as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who is looking for to know what a "wound" is, and is going from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer, but hints for the guidance of her story.
The Infectologist leaves her convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who robbed her in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, psychoanalysts reveal the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs and concludes that she “only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist”. But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'Lob der Invention', and which does not mention the finger in the wound, but is discovered.
With references to magic realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer who brought back the clouds, far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning point and told of America, the great novel that was not missing from its own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, criticizing the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the preconceived witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even got away with shame."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the fools and liars who best imagine the things," and where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs, where fiction reaches the summit.
He actually calls that the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the FIL had contributed the invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated their contribution to the great wound of social violence that invades their country - like the whole of Latin America - as a result of the fights for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unplanned commitment," she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero decided the evening, whose contribution also "promised this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-moving world also intellectual habits and the control of consciousness run out on dogmatism, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation there is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuances often mean putting fingers in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final game there are also two different styles for their respective coaches, and their opposite encounter is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinian has played with the medal to the second champion, he has remained one step behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has played successive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put a setback again, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the Elfmeter he came with 3-1 forward and got two ways to plug in his title, but eventually three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I'm going to end up, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the taxman when asked about the lost final games.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures to have learned much from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two elfmeters we were prepared to make a decision, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the Elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared to do it in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in our hands, which left us behind something for this final game, and we hope that this time it will not come."
It is in Romanso's power to not be just second champion anymore and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring with them.
The US is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves for visa applications before their consulate talks with the service providers; the costs will be reduced accordingly.
As from 10 January 2011, the procedures for requesting a visa will be amended in the United States Embassy and Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their consultation with the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The ASC staff shall record the applicant's biometric data checked by the Consulate prior to the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, as there is no longer a need to pay separately the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa need not have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
As the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consultation at the Consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the order of 26 dollars.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces finding extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented by experts of astrology at a press conference in Washington at 13.00 p.m. to examine the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life", which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in hostile environments, which so far were considered unusable, human creatures. The hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent living beings - just like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found on the basis of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that has been considered too toxic for all possible life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbial uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances are increased that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
According to the atrobiologists, when these organisms transform the arsenic, it has been shown that "it actually gives another life form, a second life form that differs from the one we know."
Tomorrow, on Thursday, the space agency announces the actual scope of its find at the press conference.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and by biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the Congress Organ Law introduces the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition bloc had already been installed, led by members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined himself as an independent. The four asked the following question: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergcia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo from PRD were weathered before the inauguration session began.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled the Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau appointed by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Deputy Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political edge with these reforms.
He claimed that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so they went out of their political will and if they didn't have it, they would again be wrong of both parties to put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Here I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there would be agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued that after being monopolistic, Congress is now supposed to be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five Members and they talk to other colleagues to make them grow more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, in reference to PAN and PRI, explained that the congress had now turned into a 'buy' for two.
"Before, it was only one party, now they split it up to two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to assign them their place in the negotiating table.
"The five that are currently seen as divided into different groups have decided to join in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that was carried out and commissioned by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical equipment.
Another check on slightly more than 200 000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on 200,144,56 peso with the number 9258447 on the last 16 November with the purpose of "counting open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent that more money would go from the community to this supply. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at higher prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total sum that you still owe and as a result the number of cheques that are still displayed in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought from her, it's just the debt paid, just like with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "shown up" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the examination of the cheques issued by the City Administration to its suppliers on July 25th, it was announced that, from March 2008 to July 9th, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where she moved cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the overthrow of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, Mazatlán's tourism industry requested special attention from the authorities, the areas in a bad condition and a poor picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Trade Union of Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions it was requested to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the roads and walkways would have had a negative effect, since the tourists would come to stroll and see the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work in this way slowly and without plan."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall had brought attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work from the city.
"The community must assume its responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How to do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are waiting longing for a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it has to be maintained, we also residents have a right to a clean habitat. City administration has to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look rude and unfinished," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito from Mazatlán."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions always keep a good shot," he added.
"These precautions were not given enough attention and these kinds of incidents simply state what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently required."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they were not properly used and caused a bad image to develop.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the front with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Unfortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which first need to be cleaned and cleaned up in order to make them attractive to tourism and to introduce them to the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Mr Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should assume the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
The company industry of Mazatlán calls for a worthy parliament, free of agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and the different social groups, who are dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and do not repeat the same patterns of partyism and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneur Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right to act free from party agreements, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming themselves into carnival co-parses of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and work above all for society and its groups, because they were the people of Sinaloa who trusted them during the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the population is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, create incentives for investment and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked the new Members to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary priority in the state budget.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second most difficult means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and stands in direct competition to the agro industry."
The tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been redefined in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Seeking Holy King
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family yearn for themselves.
For parents, it will be difficult the next three-king day to meet these wishes, because the household is no more and no less than twelve people and a goat goat goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toys and clothing they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the doings to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would have liked a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted to have a 'Monstercar' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana proposes clothing in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would have liked this monster,' but I answered him, 'let's wait, boy, for it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, during the eight-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis, around the ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where most of the drugs were to be produced.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom came from Sherbrooke, who are considered to be the main trainer of the drug ring.
The arrested persons should have appeared in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, of its possessions for sale, of the plot and of the service of crime.
These house searches were carried out as a result of a lengthy investigation which took place for over a year.
"The information received from public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel specified.
Around the 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit Estria of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Department and Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be pursued
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to deal with the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, will in all likelihood be stamped out after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I hold with a party that has tied you to your feet," explained Michael Ignatiaff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session was completed in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, infringes the Canadian legal and freedom constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law because he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned down the critics who demand that their party did not stand up enough against the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to do through the mediation of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because he seeks the guilt of refugees and has children imprisoned for at least one year," said Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the Canadians' will.
"The Canadians strongly inform the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that concern Canada and which treat the country as a step-by-step."
"They expect Canada to take tough measures," said Minister Kenney's reaction.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a Conservative said to the agency QMI that the government would call a vote so that every opposing Member would immediately declare himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, asserts that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not least discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "from the hat enchanted rabbit" as well as "from the end of the table right-made solution".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the questioning future unity.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he said.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means of forming a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, lecturer for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposes to Quebec to grant a special mandate to audit financial control so that it can conduct investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power of scrutiny as Commissioners, whatever it would allow you to oblige people to make a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government drawers.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law accordingly in order to be better targeted in this way of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, currently disagrees with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During the 2001 operation Printemps, which concerned the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Due to the high rainfall that has taken place since Tuesday in some regions of the province, several streams remain under strict supervision.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Maurice, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere, took place.
A road has sunk together in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfalls from 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation have spread to several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimetres of precipitation were expected here according to the regions by Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outauais region were most affected.
There were up to 100 millimetres of rain showers.
As the snow melts that have already accumulated in certain sub-areas are added to these precipitations, the overflow of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings on the flood alert regarding the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudiere.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière are here to be the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, the severe rainfall has dragged some lakes into Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an evasive bridge was pulled away due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains in readiness for alerts and monitors the situation in detail, says security officer Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Water Center has issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partially justified Dupont
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of its controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as because of its outrageous speech via Funk.
Although the CCNR held the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, certain statements "would, however, include incorrect information on the social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unbridled speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcasts that are broadcast throughout the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide infringed the Broadcasting Code.
The CCNR received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
The moderators should rather provide solid information than misleading information.
Regarding the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" in question would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not burdened with any blame over his person.
The final point of the dispute concerned the statements relating to the Haiti earthquake.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media - effective discussion that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI-moderator had declared that he had not given in favour of Haiti aid, since it was not certain whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not abusive characters, but that their cumulative effect represents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already abolished my three-day suspension penalty on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board is barring the dissemination of an unbridled form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM had acted "in addition to its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to notify his decisions once during the main transmission time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealian Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the Kickboxen and in the Thai box, is now rising in search of new challenges to the Tatami and into the box rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports like Kung-Fu and Kickboxes in Algeria 12 years ago," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I am looking for the fight everywhere, because for those who like to present the ground fight, like the mixed martial arts to him, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, working as a security officer and working at UPS, he had given bad news to his rivals, in which he won two gold medals from World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the amateur World Championships held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact of Kickboxen and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shuu, China."
"There were those fighters from each category who had been placed among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze collected."
"2005 I became an Achter in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place while I became third party in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where fists and footsteps are allowed as well as floor drafts.
The two fights usually play on a platform, less in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer, which has emerged from this type of martial arts, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to hold back only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," said the sympathetic pounding star.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
In the semifinals of his category (80kg), Zemmal won his first fight before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the foreheads to crown a single champion, the King of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has approved, in mutual agreement, the Project Planning Company $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely the project management, of a sum of 295 million dollars without an invitation to tender.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a companion to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector to overshadow this important hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" met the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois party, resorting to corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a shortened game and disengages competition."
"This means that instead of playing played away in a secret way, we are now doing games in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ MEP, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public can be used in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently saying that this contract would have dealt with an abbreviated game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathered, strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and "missing her in hardness".
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance, which allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in a bid for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity with regard to its work scale.
The construction process is in progress and is to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition being possible; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself is by no means an exception for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consultancy is subject to government investigations.
A brief overflying of the Quebec business register allows it to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of a lasting duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely, Dessau.
With regard to the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has taken account of this fact in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has left out the nose about the fact that the contract for project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation and there are only a few applicants, your prices will go up fast."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this March and you say that you will be able to negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that the price is not decisive, but the person's sense of purpose," Laporte confirmed.
This contract approved by the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Québécois Party.
The contracts were approved by either the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts, companies or their branches, including, in particular, resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had found 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16 to count Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in "Energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are probably known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had said that the PQ was equally connected with the companies they "financed" before she specified that it was more about their executives.
Barometer Adjective Consum - The "green" label is not trusted
Greener, but unwound skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little about the marked brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
Shame, although it is bathed in a media-reactive universe, where it is so engrossed by information for the benefit of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain of an inadequacy that makes itself known as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday showed.
Although they pushed forward the consumption of so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to be low on credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of the Quebec population admit that, in fact, giving no faith to the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green business promotion, the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke betrays.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates on the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
Following the same pattern, only 14.6% of the Quebec population takes the political discourse on this subject seriously.
Nevertheless, the information on responsible consumption seems important for the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is currently experienced by almost one third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Moreover, one third of Quebec's declared performance of green products and services is mistrustful of what they are trying to do.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from dealers in their district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum of 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, social and ecological consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that in 2010, they used public transport or preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The addition and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavior survey who feed the cliché ideas.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over Daniel Langlois's cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to reclaim his actual cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they demanded.
Although the government has accepted to intervene in this matter, it has agreed to its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a loan less than the initially hoped-for amount that could bring about a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources of public rumours that can be removed.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected from Quebec last spring, the petition has been corrected since the summarily down.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturalles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report of the case.
However, the counter proposal of the Cabinet was submitted to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to them.
In any case, the preliminaries of the state donation seem to have really been pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebec Owners' Association of Cinemas and Cinema Complexs refused to oppose a direct State investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not have any financial assistance for real estate projects there which he did not allow other cinemas to come.
In contrast, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic assistance.
After the self-funded design of the cinema, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years, which could justify the exception of the state treasury.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the head, in turn, manage a privately funded campaign, of which they expect a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini did not remove the newspaper "Le Devoir" and they ignored what he and his group consider from the proposals they made to the downside.
Mystery of complex shaking Canada ventilated
The new American diplomatic leaders, which were spread by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be under the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the superiority of the latter toward Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have the Canadian-American relations in mind during the election process, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were published yesterday, offer even more puzzling details than the mere substantial content to which one has to snuff.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, that is, during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador set up in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins has several explanations for this situation.
"As a result of the fact that the Canadians are almost inhabiting a minority complex, the Canadian political leaders may be much more inclined to talk about internal issues of everyday life than the United States in this election to send black Peter (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade), "he describes it.
The United Nations, he concludes, is therefore "the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him".
The Ambassador understands this "suffering silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it would be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship, which the voters have as a key factor in urnification."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the announcement sent by Terry Breese, Managing Director in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, that President Barack Obama will prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade resulting from a recovery programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," explains Breese.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties would have had an impact on the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Another announcement, dated January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, agrees with Washington's increasingly negative picture that the CBC series broadcast over CBC are spreading dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about such broadcasts as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle hints at Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also abductions for the purpose of hearings conducted by the CIA muscle protz.
Another communication tells us in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting to see if Europe would be willing to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is supposed to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed out to the Secretary of State a paper in punkto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again".
Finally, let us note that the moods are heating up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper's very close consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "circumcised".
He was here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global lighting renewal plan
Yesterday, in Cancun, the UN has proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCK) equivalent to almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be realised in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of the industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCCWs issued to the earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-emitting pears, which so far represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by LEDs.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet.
Last year in Copenhagen, major exhaust emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance would have to be reduced by 5 gts to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from being out of control.
95% of the energy in the white bulbs is emitted in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs you reduce this energy demand by twice again.
The compact light bulbs average between 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those brought to the market by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company, by the way, took part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-flowering pear, suggesting the savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new bulbs emit very little heat, they can also function with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact light bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and therefore they have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulbs, but rather the coal power plants, which emit much more mercury in order to generate the electricity wasted by white bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report presents in detail the profits that each country would achieve thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects excited announcement of election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "unfortunate" publication of the results of the presidential election of Côte d'Ivoire directly after its expiry.
"The Secretary-General stressed the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said one press spokesman of the UN Head of State.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibilities and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had allowed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight to end three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue working" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from all over the world have become loud, but CEI may at last call the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara, who is part of the office.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of "fraudy" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the Ex-Rebellion Camp of Forces nouvelles (UN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Côte d'Ivoire Presidency campaign, had confirmed that the UN's efforts to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's followers from going to election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the claims made by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents are now of the opinion that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who contests any connection with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results as "incomprehensible" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies affirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he has lost; and submitting a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the process of unification and reconciliation of a country divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned Côte d'Ivoire politicians that they could be held responsible for any outbursts.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, the unemployment rate in France is at a stable rate of 9.3% (including the overseas departments to 9.7%), the provisional seasonally adjusted data published by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee on Thursday show.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is estimated to be 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the overseas departments.
The unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points over the year.
In more detail, 3.4 million workers of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the inclusion of overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to IAA data.
The elderly, for their part, have experienced a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% involving overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on his calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), and was sent to Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of subjugating company assets, misrepresentation of general property, heeling, co-corruption in corruption, illegal bribery and gun ownership, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is prepared to fight and plans to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading brain sparing."
"It is easy to consider a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the Department, had stressed the need to give the judge a memorial to his justification before hearing with his lawyer.
A member of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill running.
As regards the field of business competence or the location of the associated funds, he would never have known, says Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne Exile, was accused on Wednesday for failure and complicity, but was ordered to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more persons had been charged and released from custody on Wednesday on the night of Tuesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole disposal company (MPM), is prosecuted by "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one due to the title "intelligence and miscarriage of general property by a public service agent", the other because of "commitment in the misappropriation of public funds".
The lifemate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "healing and subjugation of corporate wealth".
One of the people who were confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public machinations affecting Corsica.
The banners suspected his society to have contributed to the washing of money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation indicate that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its central role for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, a young French researcher, who was detained in Iran for "Spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in an emergency and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the close supervision of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained his strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advices on dealing with their own crisis of "broadcasts" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and of the American justice due to trade in material for the benefit of Iran's Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a glaring light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way in which hostages are handled".
François Richier, Elysée's advisor on strategy issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They encouraged the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Matt noise", they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without neglect" the words "basic human rights", "innocent", "indecent release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into embarrassment, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because "silence doesn't solve anything", past the discussion attempts over inconspicuously, the Iranians are "Masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic": "Girl taken for political repression".
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to come on August 16th, on the day when she fled to the French Embassy) "needs to pay a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230.000 Euro deposit).
And he allows the elysée to anticipate further hostages, a phenomenon that will "shatter itself".
Iranians could " arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison twelve days ago, but is still detained in Iran.
An information has been circulated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding to Iran because of illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials, has been released after a judge's arrest in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American message raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand by Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, who is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear programme.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian from the French ?
François Richier assures Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "awesome surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under the "harder" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a phone number, returns, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in charge of the buildings in Paris led by the Iranian Embassy".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not protect its efforts to believe by means of statements and media-organized "flight trials", Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influenced mediator role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 enrages the "media flash of the French authorities".
What is based on so much "thank witness" to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy asks.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to lapse this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria", he analyses.
A 2008 policy launched at the time "was perceived as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role building up" tries to introduce Paris "Syria in front of what promise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow a balance between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11 François Richier had entrusted her with this: "of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Cinderella", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight by blocking access, so the government administrators said.
A bill designed to call on online game operators to deny young people under 16 years of age after midnight access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, described representatives of culture and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning in school and also with living a normal life day by day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Ministerial Officer of the French Press Agency Agence France Press, with this draft law.
The online games will be open again from 6 am in the morning.
The manufacturer companies had a year to prepare for the application of the law, so it clarified.
The government also intends to ask manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for accessing these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible person added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events involving intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the Richterland
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the World Championships' organisers for the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political choice, in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities associated with the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
The skills behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA Evaluation Report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the completion of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temari and Amos Adamu), could have ruined equally well the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only once allowed to take the World Cup, namely 1966.
The BBC had again given the floor on Monday by sending out a documentary report, which takes over three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who were primarily working intensive lobbying with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess move accomplished by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort suffice to rejuvenate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack debris with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about Spain's and Portugal's solvency, raise the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (Stadia, Hotels, Transport) has become a significant outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the infinitude of the appeals of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the Committee members.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin weathered.
For 2022, the United States seems strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be the logical favourites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages vis-à-vis Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the 2026 World Cup that FIFA wanted to grant for China, which allowed the Asian opportunities to fade into 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the anticipation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by European countries (due to time shifts), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really broken.
Midrand had led him to believe he was breaking up.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of state will be Ergo candidate in 2012.
But openness is not a good sight to the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to act as if there was a doubt from then on.
One, as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's followers claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15 Nicolas Sarkozy assured him of his decision to make "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP Parliamentaries he would have the perspective of "two mandates" sounded a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We're missing a lot.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year term of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
New in May 2010: "Don't believe that I don't think about the subsequent phase."
His words of yesterday make him no longer a candidate than the day before, but also no less.
Should they bring out comments, then for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the competition around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS urge more early than accepted for a fight.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, voters of the Right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions about it with the UMP," responded directly and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found a defeat possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in winning," corrects Alain Juppé, who has settled with openness.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to keep its purchases of state papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the appointment of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to be concluded by the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt requires that the central bank in Frankfurt cannot afford to achieve even today's more than tense situation in the European bond markets in order not to cause its deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving Europe's sovereign debt.
It did not dare to say whether it believed that the central bank could do even more, for example by stimulating its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partner (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the occasion of his hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, was not very concerned with his projects, but rather pleased to note that the programme of purchases of state papers on the secondary market would "continue" and that we would "see the decisions at the meeting on Thursday".
Only certainty: The ECB will remain its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to the discretion of some traders, yesterday she is supposed to have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese state papers.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among traders, the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price is not doubted at all (see page 29).
There is no longer any remarkable change in the prices of the farmers.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter will still be able to create the unrestricted funds reserves in a generous way over a period of one week up to three months.
People's concerns today are that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme".
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Volkswirtt of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit foreseen for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Norbert Bräms adds, in the area of its intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB was to maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that would make a difference to the prevailing market.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must be placed on the market at any cost by the lack of investors and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest countries," one important bond holder testified yesterday.
For if interest rates were to start on a high flight, countries would be even more hindered from reducing or even stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government goes to cover in Italy
After an alarming week beginning for Italy, the situation has relaxed a little yesterday with the decline of square interest rates to 10 years.
A return to false silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, regional chairperson Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indivisible" and heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, but the person in question immediately denied it.
In any case, on Tuesday the Schere with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had increased to 263 points, which had led to some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkwirt at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that his problem is the abstinence of economic growth and the associated slump of tax inputs that threaten the state to be unable to meet its financing needs.
The last forecasts from Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget before the Senate is estimated to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission estimates that next year's budget deficit will remain 4.3% of GDP (as opposed to the 3.9%) and 3.5% predicted by governments in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
Therefore, the uproar is also a new budget collective, which could be used at a total of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
At present, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated and we have been repeating this for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is in charge of the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, since, despite Italy's high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), less stabilisation progress is required than in other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD's chief economist.
Remains the question of political inconsistencies.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections could be organised by the end of March.
There is therefore a slightly favourable period for a decision-making process with regard to a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had expressly stressed it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it was still proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly holding together, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency".
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not possible to speak from the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, which is probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly due to banking systems," says the opinion of the peoples of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, since "political time is much slower than that of markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of this gap as well as the danger involved, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in the wider sense, with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
This also applies to Eurogroups and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the table, the loss of unconventional measures to strengthen the countries of the euro area in the cross-border cross-border markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia-Tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicitly fundraising, he will certainly prepare the terrain for this.
The first European Agency for Safety and Health at Work expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the agency Reuters had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct engagement of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the main countries, are in favour of adopting structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms which add to austerity measures, but which are intended to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
Both the one and the other are in favour of avoiding international aid at all costs, before they set up their own budget corrections and decide on essential structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
The European investors, in turn, talk about the options available to speed up the normalisation of government bonds markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, had the first to come up with the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pocket.
The people of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market in European public debt, judge the actor in the very foreground, an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This funding exists: the European mechanism of increased financial stabilisation, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
A advisory board which has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are at the forefront.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 departments in Orange Alarm Level
The snow episodes are still experiencing traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange's alarm stage due to the threat of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in the orange alarm stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshowers dance the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also expected from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic barriers and to impair certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads have been closed for heavy transport of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police who refuse to use their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been crossed throughout the day.
In Picardie schooling was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for heavy goods transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
On Thursday, the DGAC asked airlines to eliminate 25% of their flights starting from Orly, due to expected heavy snowfall, from Roissy airport in Paris and 10% of their flights starting from Orly.
DGAB recommends that airline passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketch
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy at the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion will be remembered for Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the SGP to the start of construction, the State has called out a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical schema, this is the sum which the SGP would then allow to give part of the financial sum to the markets to their doubles.
Finally, today the first tallies have come to light.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which is provided by the National Assembly's Financial Commission for the morning, contains the measures envisaged to fund the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on the development and higher taxation of the offices at the Ile-de France.
The former, thus removing Article 15 of the draft law, goes "to the benefit of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is stated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it to increase the product resulting from it and to pass this increase on to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not counted in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital allocation that the State imposes and that the Société du Grand Paris is gradually made for the project," the explanatory statement is to be taken.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment when you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the planning for three years and then only get out of the 4 billion," is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the four billion promised, which will continue to be sought for a long time, is in danger of producing a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Harmful hackers and emulsive spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On one side, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of purgatory that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste for the future dominated by regression.
But let's move forward.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper extracts.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw away nothing more than what you've been able to read in every year's journal (except for those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the frighteningly caricatured profile Gaddafi's offered cabaret artists for a long time already for their sketches.
The rule that the secret files may only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotherian publications, you will see that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosenkreuzlers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent one), but because those who devote themselves to occultism do not believe in anything other than what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Same thing about the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (or else he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, who had sent the American Embassy in Rome to the State Dezernat, was the same as those who had published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such an end to the disclosures of this dossier made?
On one side, these are saying what each educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then the heads of government have been able to call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spying centers.
Every spectator of investigation films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless: the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second of all, the idea that an x-any hacker can get to know the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the state dezernat.
In addition, the scandal puts the victims less at risk than the "sharpeners".
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, in Orwell's times, one could bundle all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has since been able to turn out to be perfectly correct, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction made, the hotel visited, the selected motorway and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if you face what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a citizen's revenge - can bring the secrets of power to the fore.
But how can a power that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkel is basically a secret free from secrecy, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did not do Sarkozy or Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this violation that has been inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will not put any reserved information on-line - that would be similar to a hanging on the road corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with current technologies to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state is moving on a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could certain relationships be maintained in the future, private and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction sounds like science fiction and romantic at the moment, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agents moving in secret ways on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages anywhere but in mere memory, and beyond that the few written information they have received hiding in shoe sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, watergate spying had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for tape by tying from the back to the front and venting all the secrets of the installation, while the (numeric) CDs today do not allow anything but jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
The high-speed trains travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the change.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was forged for secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks well of its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the quickly settled financing promise (also called "Fast Start" or "earlier financing") realised by developing countries.
And already the rough French beauties are exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to making 30 billion dollars available between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed progress report by their Member States, press conference, major incident events, brochure distribution.
The transparency operation is remarkable and estimated for its actual value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces release of EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which will lead to the right way to respect for its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Treaty in order to ensure that additional use has been made, without harming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen as a benchmark for those in 2009: international financing will be maintained and 150 million will be allocated for over three years as part of the "fast start" financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in respect of year or in relation to conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries may remain stable (or may decrease) - France provides for its commitment to the "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are € 1 borrowed as equivalent with € 1 donated.
Obviously this is hard to bear: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is taken as equivalent to a euro donated... Moreover, only the cost of the loan should be considered as a commitment to the donor country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with the following considerations: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, taking up 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and providing 8.5%) - see also the EU document in order to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that makes substantial use of loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) keep 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 to fulfil its obligations, France will spend just 10 cents, including a comparable operation.
Beautiful Hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: to some extent with a further development of the action over time and to the other side with the reality of financial deployment.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36,1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems likely that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once the EU-internal (why do the other member states continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not allow themselves to be completely deceived...
The chapter of the advanced financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the overall discussion on the climate.
But it could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal treatment with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, decisive and currently discussed issue): it does not escape the question of "preciseability" or the type of recording of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is with other issues.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "preciseability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the basis of international trust that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pestilence taken by children
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Vereinigung Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "are not statistically significant in view of the small number of samples analysed, but represent the illustration character of the problem treated", had generally purchased the food consumed in Oise and Paris between July and September, from about ten years old to meals, plus an intermediate meal time in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have also been investigated as well as nesting of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counterbalance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the approximate total of the cases, it is very good to note that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptors is worrying," says the association.
Already during breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three have proved safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate period for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included at lunchtime, where the study has identified traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna from the bush, even the baguette and gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were also plucked.
In the tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "most abundant", and even the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unburdened.
According to the study, the final risk of this "polluting substance" for the consumer "is likely to be underestimated".
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, in turn, proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
