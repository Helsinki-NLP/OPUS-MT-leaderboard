According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Police from Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorcycle after they had observed it leaving a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before writing off to the bushland, where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person matching the description of the driver were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha police charge a 20-year-old man with failure to observe a stop signal and ruthless driving.
He shall appear before the County Court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read in a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, asleep, and could not signal acknowledgment."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set up the negotiating date for November 17th at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Refocusing on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"As unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Minnesota democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employee empowerment law together with the citizens' right icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representative in order to complain to a civil court for justice - and in order to obtain compensation for damages or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other sponsors of their bill propose is to link it back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and comply with labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that militarized autocracy would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers are guaranteed for union and joint negotiation and action."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and to any profession or trade.
Agreements restricting or aimed at reducing this right are null and void and are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chair of the International Commission of Human Rights, which was designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "anyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries about how civil and democratic societies could be formed, Americans explained that the right to set up a trade union - and that this union would then have to be protected from collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and governmental bodies.
In fact, after these rights in America came under fire, it is very wise to face up to the American ideal, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has wonderfully created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made great in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which the attorney says it would probably have led to the closure of all five government abortion clinics.
This measure, which was enacted by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and will enter into force on September 1st, would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient's right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles in order to acquire their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that the doctors may, for the time being, continue to be able to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing will be held for the judge in order to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion supporters welcomed the decision, the recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors took so much more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are missing a devious law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five hospitals in the state to comply with the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment extended to the doctors from the two clinics who did not join the action and also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that doctor’s admission rights require unnecessary restrictions.
Disposal opponents hold that the measures serve the protection of women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient rights, informed the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery because of fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient access rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher mortality rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video home for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data from more than 1100 Australians, where ovarian cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research manager Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIES: New medicines could slow down lung and ovary cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases as well as social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest for older women and those whose cancers had already advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter distances, as a possible remedy, she proposed strengthening the service of doctors involved to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more closely at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling houseowners
The decline, together with an increased decrease in the number of houseowners under 35, could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year of garden centres when today's young consumers reach the "garden products" group after a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with home spend for their garden.
The increase of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting courtyards for park purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which estimated £5 billion per year are put into sale.
In the Greater London area, where the proportion of houseowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot attract plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to rising domestic wealth and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also forecast an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the priest Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have stoned the state TV station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have forced the Protestants out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away from it, they supplied themselves with poles and stones equipped with safety forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters called for Sharif's resignation, but he rejected it.
The army of the country therefore urges a political solution to the conflict "to waste and apply without time without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains bound by its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already washed more frequently.
The opposition politician Imran Khan is urging Prime Minister Sharif to cheat in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were escalated on weekends after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diploma for spying reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's most senior U.S. diplomats to provide information on a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the U.S. Ambassador's and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main activity area for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany's most important secret service had in the visor also caused much more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning Strike: Locusts threaten with consequences for commuters
The national warning strike of the driver on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The distance announced for 18 to 21 hours concerns all transport companies throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district president of the trade union Deutscher Lokomotiveführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There is no regional focus.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so that it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Attorney General of Mallorca.
The chief of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption accusations by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after accusations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf lie.
According to the online daily Majorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and civil servants of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Attorney for Corruption Fighting Majorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the charges of corruption and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the government's nursery has a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video, where an 18-year-old British tourist was shown to perform on 24 men during a summer swim tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of alcoholics in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamous drunken pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage had to pay a penalty of €55,000 (73,000) together.
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
FRUIT has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong wind, which affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 pm, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already settled on Sunday at night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started shortly before 8 pm and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had taken care of an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city returned to a peak of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The harsh weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go through.
At that time, wind was about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally set up at around 8.40 p.m.
The delay in flight resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthias thinks: Maximum time to connect
In view of the galloping technological progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech shift centers, our columnist Bernd Matthias is comforted by a familiar electronic accessories.
While I'm writing this, I'm looking at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I'm thinking, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there's a thought behind it: if the cable weren't, in the shortest time, all the listeners would fly around in the house wild, and that would be even more retro.
In any case, does it apply to the eceltronic (eceltronic?
No, typing error: electronic) Sector the rule that the world news of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And who, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, simply says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the breathing of the Ifa at the radio tower again this week brings to mind our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The layman, who had previously mastered the washing machine and CD players blindly, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with unimaginable vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you all right?
What should one talk about with people who seem to voluntarily spread such quarks?
In fact, for some 20 years we have been mainly concerned with networking our house.
So that the yoghurt re-orders itself, so that the fire detector informs us on vacation on the Maldives that it is burning in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were to get from the air conditioning office on our arrival soon ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true in the near future: we lift up our watch, you say loudly "saws!" - and at home the vacuum robot goes off.
Irrre.
Everything goes to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are floating", a industry expert, one can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses shows how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but what does not help because we are in the dust.
We also know from daily practice that when a new-moded device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in shelters, while rockets and mortars had been fired at their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools were closed in Gaza, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket holes in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, who was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls prior to the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little strange" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further from Gaza in safer areas and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenades, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, which is heavily drawn by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide security."
Last Tuesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to an unrestricted ceasefire.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unsolved, such as the call of Hamas for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the airports and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests this information and estimates that at least half the killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades while fighting Israeli cities, most of them in the south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into provisional shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue fighting, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can learn more, just as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD ban procedures
In view of the NPD’s loss of voice in Saxony, the CDU Bundesweise Thomas Strobl spoke in front of the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the current NPD ban procedure.
Berlin - According to the CDU Bundesesvisze Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts off worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU Head of State in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a happy development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is fought politically rather than in front of the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed very little on the five-percent watch during the Sunday vote.
A first attempt to ban the right-wing extreme party had failed in 2003 because constitutional protection had at that time also in the NPD top informants.
In December 2013, the Bundesrat submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
Refugees are now accommodated in tents at Neuländer Platz.
The central first recording for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all the seams.
Now the Internal Authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The District Politicians were only informed shortly before - they are not very excited.
"These Hauruck actions continue to spare citizens and give district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that the District Administration of Harburg currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling the initial take-up are the rush of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-way market.
RP data shows that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent last year, whereas in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra is hard hit by cuts in government expenditure and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that the beginning of the spring would see an increase in the real estate available for sale for the next few months, which would put the market under "a real test".
"If you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the consistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and certifies this to pose "like a field master".
This is not the style of the university, it is stated in the communication.
The Medau family had already been "informed orally about the college's inauguration in mid-June.
The statement that the plans did not become known until July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "provisions or even decisions", but there were "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road that is necessary for access to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
It was from a nine metre wide street and is not the speech.
According to current position, it is 5.50 meters, which is a meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The Medau operator's argument that their free and schooly parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future does not want Pötzl to apply.
Zugeparkt is not going to be at all because, as with other public parking places, it is now possible to solve this intelligently.
Thinking about the locals
According to the president of the university, the children's script Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and would lead the entrance to the park deck at the front door, is "not affected".
Rather, it is worth considering, "that this is not only about the children's script, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Sreib Street and the 800 students of the adjacent real school.
So it's a lot more than Mr. Medau's personal interests," said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents council of the children's script, with the expansion of the road would be "lost of a few naturally left spots of Coburg" would be entitled to "can the readers decide for themselves".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's script about the plans of the university last week.
Therefore, the access to the new park deck should not lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Sreib-Straße, as before, but over the Medau-Berg.
This would require two-track expansion of the narrow road to about one kilometer in length.
According to the Medaus figures, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase by ten times.
The talk is about 2000 cars a day.
From the city side they have not yet wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from Handball National Team
Holger Glandorf won't play for the DHB team anymore.
The 31-year-old by the Federal ligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt pointed out health problems for this decision in particular.
I didn't like the decision easily, she's matured for several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion announced on his Facebook page.
He thus goes into international retirement with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the heavy-duty player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on goal hunting for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announces his cadre for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me just as they will inspire my long-time co-players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available healthy in the next few years too, longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had even had to fear his career after a heel infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles’ tendon problems, he had been treated with a cortisone syringe by team doctors of the German Handball League (DHB) who later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health facilities that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
Here are some other complaints related to wear.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I can control my head, but can't fool my body," Glandorf explained the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, it would only be ready in an absolute emergency.
"When all the stripes rip, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father explained the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a bit straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League, he won the 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) EHF Cup.
In 2012, Flensburg also secured the European Cup winner.
German economy decreased by 0.2 percent in the spring
The crises surrounding the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investments declined.
The economy was also slowed down by external trade.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, for the first half of 2013 a total of 0.8 per cent of GDP is generated compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Minsterland-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycle tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through the Münsterland.
Written out in various specialist journals, this tour was offered to interested people.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland even more in this way," the cyclists were delighted by the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbroderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Furthermore, the route, which had been written out for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on their way to Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
Chief organiser Jos ter Huerne and mayor deputy Heinz Lölfing were delighted by the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for everyone involved.
The organization went through without problems and there were no negative incidents", Heinz Lölfing concluded a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped were coming, which was probably due to bad weather forecasts and morning rain.
"We will see ourselves again in 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or another weekend", the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, Liedermacher, Pazifist, polit safe activist, ex-Häftling, in "Mönch und Krieger" brought to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thought fetters, the Munich-born on June 1, 1947, has written down his memoirs, starting every chapter with a suitable lyrics.
And he's out of his mind: from Onanie as a gymnast to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes abstract, but all the more more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the ground, in very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how not only the music influenced him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is "caused by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary away".
However, there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-spirited views: for example, about beatings in a local or a crazy car ride by GI, where he directed a tree frontally.
Even there, he is unsoundly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tastes for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only his voice stopped: "Listen to the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's time, he won an insight into how life would have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep styky labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of rust.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him singing because he was able to wash the foundry of himself.
When I ran around there, I realized that he had been doing it for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew bigger.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ expressions of affection.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
Only when my mother was ill towards the end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22.
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's strenuous.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may show up in his elegant short cut beard.
Since being praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been united by the theatre.
The comedy of the errors followed, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the Sitcoms and comedies that have filled their busy working life.
He started at only 16 years of age when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black immitator/comedian on TV for a quite long time."
He learned to work.
I had to grow up not only in front of the public but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke teller while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry brought up his Comedy there for five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "for many years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and movie roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it feels like you're just taking the time or getting a little in the way."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought him mostly for a middle class domain, white in tights and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very scared.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't hurt me if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was excited.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost like someone finally put my head on right.
"That's what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the delusions.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed your mind."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the director announced that the performance continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This too came well, so it is like a large shield of gods telling me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNDE voice.
So I'm staying with you.
I really love it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a Comedian - our conversation has been perplexed by humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I want to, but in total I don't get as much as before.
I wonder if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen’s capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital Sasai.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi-Führer Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened, according to the sheet, with a further escalation of the conflict, his claims should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis fight for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi people's tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding country there are always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain "spirit workers"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically in order to remove "spirit workers" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid a government notice.
The government assumes that thousands of people will receive salary payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his entry into office in 2013.
At a test at the beginning of this year it was found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month were lost to payments for "spirit workers" and through other abusive financial practices.
The government assumes that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded has been communicated in a government message.
All those who did not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of public service by identifying the actual number of officials and by adjusting the salary list at both levels of government - so the "spirit workers" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be dealt with in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim damages of Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in civil proceedings at the Düsseldorf Landgericht 19.4 million euros.
This was announced by a court speaker on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and oldtimers and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has purchased valuable items for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
Forty-four years he was in the school service, 23 of them as head of school.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershausen and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his striving to see the people in the pupil.
The snowheads are the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in Trautenau/Nordbohmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was already interested in the teacher's profession after four years.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were absent.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
That's how Richter turned to the Upper Franconian town of Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers to the next train station six times a week, go to Bamberg by train, go through the whole city to school and back in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a sleeping space in a red-creuz home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dorm.
In 1951, he completed his second state degree and in 1954, after three years.
Since he did not have a free teacher's office, Oberbayern went to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the School Association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Petershausen five.
From the school year 1968/69 these were grouped in Petershausen in today's Town Hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to escape a relapse in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to obtain the present building, which was extended after Richter's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who also built cellars at municipal expense and during the expansion of 1997, although this was not eligible under the School Building Guidelines.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school friendly", judges remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a lecture by a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know, "That doesn't always work out." Whether he's just talking about his students or about his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case judges were sometimes unconventional.
When students stumbled, they did not get some sort of criminal work from him and were not tarnished to the next chair.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had purchased two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents come against each other, even if there should be a veil.
For the sake of the school, judges as rector maintained a good relationship with then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
It moved the partyless judge, after his retirement, to run for the municipal council at least as the last on the CSU list in 1996.
But judges were elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten intermediate stops
When cyclists make on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing in itself special.
On Friday, however, only the number of rests made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4-radtour and accompaniment tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open air in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radeln and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel, where they enjoyed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, which took 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmen were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was taken with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
In order to refresh the body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: the country women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, pork, sprinkler and cheese smokes, which made a wonderful mouth for the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake country women", praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be achieved at the level of the Turnverein's Geis-Nedda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operatic and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a massage of his partner's head: "He earned it, finally he has already fastened bicycle chains that have already been thrown off today".
Thus, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of reporter Rainer Janke's Trinkukhaus and took the opportunity to advertise at the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also PhD director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-radtour 2004 as a tour guide, could only be brief, but he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated Facebook entries and made reports with his employees and the 15-head motorcycle squad of the police Hessen, using three phones and a radio, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants came from the Rhein-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many cities in westernfalen bikers have arrived.
The number of participants depends on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved for farewell.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course one had prepared delicious estates, such as flame cakes with well cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his role as CEO of ADAC Hesse-Thüring, welcomed visitors.
The three were clearly delighted with the "many operation in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move freely under the sky was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, increasingly citizens, who were affected by the good mood as well as the great crowd of cyclists, were mixed.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - stood on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government staff, including four ministers of government last December.
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal association and started telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergy Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk his daughter to school.
There he informed waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held at every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pafeithow, head of the school in Slavjansk, the daughter of Jazenjuk, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that children will receive education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She meets with a proud famed sling from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she's got her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson's parent company's top post went to a younger male colleague.
It is said that their settlement amounted to nearly £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
It was recommended by Lord Browne, former president of BP, to David Cameron when he sought more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
As early as May, I described the role of the president with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside on the first Guard of their own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also on the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming president would risk starting on everything and getting apart from an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps taking care of his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is drawing nearer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is associated with special risks.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year, the British public buys in the certainly largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent of them support them today, compared to 31 percent ten years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my mobile nowadays and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that decreasing tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a decreasing remark about the democratic district attorney who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of the authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another by Perry's user account, which cancels the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the tweet and I deleted it," it was said in the later news.
Perry's employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who is actually serving the feed.
In the former tweet, an unprofitable image of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn who was sentenced to tax in April 2013 for drunkenness.
Perry filed a veto against financial support for her office when she refused to resign, which led to an accusation against Perry - who might be presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drink with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but when I do, I appeal to Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the drunkest democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a state attorney from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads for not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal advisers requested in the case judge to reject the charge and argued that the law against the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the State's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed his fifth term at the Iowa Election Meetings during his presidential candidate in 2012, Perry agreed to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley explains the housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England was "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly coveted and the subject of huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set upper limits for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment of action".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Katasteramt, prices in the urban area alone jumped by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student offerings increased by about one fifth in the last year and were around £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "vial tax" before the general elections in the coming May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which tighter lending arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of a already weak house price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter a year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for forward sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and, as a result, future sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new self-catering homes in the year to the end of April – almost one third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent to £280 million per year, sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Company's Annual Meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that Berkeley's revenue is expected to be in line with current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 in the afternoon in London.
Naked Photos of Jennifer Lawrence by Hacker released on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar Award.
Naked photos of Oscar Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 Starlets.
A star representative from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker about "clarifying violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were reportedly obtained from Apple by a gap in the online storage system iCloud. The alleged "masterlist" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim vs the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos my husband and I have taken years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so very satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" however suggests that it was about pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are FEELING, people.
Let's get started. *Wortspiel intends to play*.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They were broken, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a carton that you left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distanced and perhaps a little scratchy.
Then shook his hand.
He knew Kratzburst.
He was soaring, like in lgel, yes.
The last victim of this agility was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than before, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more secluded and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older escort that Kevern thought of her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradisiac valley named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, in the baths were still spiders, neck snails had left their tracks on all windows and believed they belonged to all this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, which looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and seductive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn hanging on the broken sun loungers in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both of them joined the service console, which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had gladly listened to at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - Nothing was so properly forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully unsold, just as the word obscured.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations had never done, and as the people in books choose the vom-counterwashers-to-millionaire-memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads during the music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a coarse-comical serenade of Ailinn's great feet.
Alinn didn't understand that.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anyone.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not banned.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only place for a single "win" in life.
People wanted to be absolutely sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
The same mind.
His inestimability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressive.
Although he was 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Once again, there were no laws or constraints.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society was gratefully in agreement with the principle of group talent, as well as those spared by fate.
People with African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family did not remain without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks broke plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHITE WAR, WHO WAS HAPPENED WAR- Out of fear to be accused of fire brigades, out of fear even that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants, thought and became depressed with inactivity.
Each one according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words which Kevern had just told her could ever be displayed.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers to her lips again in her presence.
After all, she thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head infidelity and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing to see all over the world but her unchallenged black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're doing it to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked at it again.
Your feet aren't like that.
Maybe your ankles, a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate it?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the soothing charm that one needed to embarrass the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he wanted to be Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of her chair, overturned the console and poured out the wine they had been drinking.
Holunderblütenwein, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In their excitement she seemed to tremble like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perversely drawn to you," she said.
Except that I'm not at all.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rose up against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here like there on the shore.
The same confused men, with still thicker skin and more perplexing according to DEM WAS GES WAR as their ancestors were smugglers and beach robbers, pulled from pube to pube, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a big fist if she didn't watch out!
They first gnaw - Knuts were the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a countertox to the unspeakable love ballroom from the console - they first knelt and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knocking itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
He rose out of the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt bleached, but the wax of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You hardly knew each other.
She watched him as he was removed - just as she saw her companion from a room on the upper floor - a man who complained about something he himself had raised up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, shamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just reported, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public mood monitoring body, worked on a short lecture on continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely the areas in which their reduction, if not abolition, would be most likely, given the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has already been done and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the inborn aggressiveness of a people who waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness was historically felt despite the high demanding church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be indestructible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The population is crying when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicated with stories of overcrowded difficulties and claiming to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former rawness holds rural communities as well as our urban fabric in hand, but there are also evidences of the emergence of a new and resilient struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme walnut fell her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme called for her right to privacy and refusal of statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I was against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a job that is completely free of charge.
We serve a largely free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
They themselves have obvious prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "remain" and "raw" could be interpreted equally well by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If one continues to wander around, WHAT IS HAPPENED, IF IT WAS, IF IT had happened yesterday, it would mean taking its essential life force to the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED writing train in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
If you smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen to, agree, apologize.
Speak is better than silence, the sung word is better than that written, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to go on," answered Esme Nussbaum with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we have not yet been healed as effectively as we ourselves do.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves finding ourselves repeating the mistakes we have made to DEM WHAT IS IN HISTORY.
But this time it's not the others we're letting out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an English patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you say that these would have left their "wildness" and their "faith" to "others".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are not talking about "us" and "others" when understanding the past as in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From him, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured to say, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well what happened has happened.
That was back then.
Nothing has to be said about this - that is where we agree.
And just as no guilt must be assigned, no guilt must be blamed, if such an extermination would be appropriate and if there was a way to destroy it.
But to what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget them.
If I may say anything about this -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said, and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was passed by a motorbike driver who, as passersby described, was driving on the road in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Mr Lesotho-Military said that no state strike was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representative of the military in Lesotho refused to have planned a coup to overthrow the government and said that they were going against policemen who are being accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the army of the country had surrounded its county residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting on assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup d'état, but the military responded to the threat of "political fanatics" whose weapons were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defence forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several intelligence reports that within the police there were some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Even if no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that Lesotho's activities have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
The military spokesman of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers would retreat into their barracks and that the situation in the capital would be calm.
In the meantime, the Vizepremeier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during the absence of Thaban.
Thabane announced that he believed he had become the target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his single government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government's accusations otherwise loudly.
Eurozone production on a 13-month-rate
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest point in August of the last 13 months, with a closely observed study.
The final Markit purchase manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced break-ins in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will take place before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with the eurozone's slow recovery and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that over the course of this week the ECB’s Head of ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information on whether he is considering quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more evident for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51,4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a caretaker, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer taking place are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry in the Eurozone of August is that the sector continues to grow afterwards."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are currently finding life quite difficult, as current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that it would be "more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The hellteenth of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children, heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war, which now haunts Ukraine - and in the child like they die - will now end.
The girl who was photographed at the attempt to climb back to the school hall that was shot
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliacow when she tried only to climb back to the school sports hall that was shot after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida back then.
My legs were flooded with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of surgeries she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday she said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knee.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people how they have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says militantly.
"This happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and begin my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory becomes somewhat weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I go back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and help to keep things from happening again.
The boy who fled through the ballpoint hail thought his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down when there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was gonna die.
She said to him, "Run."
Frightened, she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying grandchild on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a ball hook.
His father Vladimir, who put his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality Tamara was stunned outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in its assumption that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it gets more pale in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid of going back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember these kids I played with in the yard and they didn't make it out there.
We never say they were killed or killed.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially at the toy store where I could choose everything I wanted and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
One day I want to go to the police and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly recalls her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her herself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir liked to eat Borshtsch and call all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war is continuing now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are exactly the same children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remind himself, but he has six close friends from class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the sofa, the face turned away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I impugned him, "Damir, run, run away", but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, a right picture of Georgij today
His blood-flowing face was marked by fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarian of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before hurrying to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was an entire family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day in which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always haunt me.
No one's ever gonna forget this, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgy in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden in the bookshelf with us at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever learn the truth.
Humans constantly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what caused him?
This world is going to turn into something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does this happen?
Ten years is nothing like that.
We need dozens of years to forget about it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st September approaches.
I'm going to count my old childhood friends Tribut.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and went to a medical school in Wladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to train in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was imprisoned in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his health damage caused by the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is excruciating and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical staff, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never report my children's experiences.
Of course, children should not know about this and they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It's still in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if you do something so unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated multiple times, he can run, but he can't play sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the siege and that only heightens my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the slain.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart leaped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how could we be fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more have been killed.
If only we could grasp and cast out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was carried in security by a special deployment command
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special deployment command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the crueltys at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from Beslan's siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty held back her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous mind.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife, Swetlana, who named him after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are both available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes, which optimise the exposure time for damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Find in our shopping guide and ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode with which a number of recordings with slightly modified exposure settings are made, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill out the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agonie of the disease and the suffering of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the people treated are mostly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May this year.
I was having trouble picking up.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he had impatiently accused his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything right now than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and worried for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to perform an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast coat, that is, the skin that attacks the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have had lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have previously been smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos strain - contact with the fiber material, which was once considered "wound fabric" but has now been recognized as lethal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, but industry has voluntarily undertaken to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clamps, construction workers, roommates and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he seems to be hardly concerned today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the climax of a mesolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual rates of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all asbestos types were banned) is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been selected as a starting ground.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer that question.
"From the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have been suffering from Mesothelioma for the past five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are still going to get sick?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.
When he died on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliosis patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still going to get sick?"
UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to occur in the UK, a total of 90,000 people will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts to which the persons concerned often turn for damages shows how far the hostage of the mesothelioma is already spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had failed to expose asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of Mesothelioma, I never really knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, flooring plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, but the EU and WHO consider it a "great health risk" with possible death sequences.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "this is clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomas."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London, Asbestos Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those concerned, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure to work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could expect to be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government might have been unconsciously exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes behind the parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the management of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds of labour must be spent over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that, according to the 2015 general elections, Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference center rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not dealt with in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never precisely determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital in which asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45, and just late in the evening he performed an operation.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I'd stop driving home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest coat that touched the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Wondered doctors made X-rays of his chest and used pleuracathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after exercise and severe breathing.
In 2011 a patient in his practice came to an end with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his home doctor took his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and chest coat.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I didn't worry so much at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year: "It was said to me that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over decades after the war, hospitals for patients may have been lifesaving, but life threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students turned their bunk burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have placed their bunk burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And sometimes so innocent objects in our houses such as underfloor plates or shed roofs have included asbestos by default.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our property," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a woman concerned was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch how you rip off your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That's it then."
Mesothelioma is particularly homely because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
When asbestos is stirred up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle around the lungs in the chest coat, the skin.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast coat and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects that it exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they will be pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is invasive from the beginning of nature.
The usual options in other cancers do not work so well in mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some think it's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest coat," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Thus, the cancer is "not very well addressed to chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advice office for those affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he presented himself happy when calling.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and would only extend his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be remitted, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail inevitably, many people are concerned about another financial concern - about the future of families leaving them behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that one realized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the neglect of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally contributed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation to his death, however, a speaker of the Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who seek compensation, to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation which makes it easier for mesotheliom-affected people to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has established a fund of £350 million, funded by the insurance industry, for all those who have been diagnosed after July 2012, can show a contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have told them in a normal compensation process - approximately 120,000 pounds.
Some 300 successful applications are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesotheliomas that £350 million represented a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone over and Mesotheliom sufferers found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both money and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven victims a quick action is needed every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasure, he expected to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, the most important thing," said Abbott.
This can be seen again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you're going to get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott performed the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-surgery scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
It's not life threatening.
It's life-threatening.
Once again, Abbott was subjected to six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumors visible anymore.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You need to think about practical things - about the money, if I'm not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You need to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very cozy and unspoiled.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reticent.
She didn't say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelios, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings a grim security (as well as for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong's right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the growing call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists lead the planning and mobilization into the way within a few hours after the announcement.
In principle, the decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows Communist leaders to reject all non-tangling candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
Hong Kong residents have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defending the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-General Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let its inhabitants choose the government president from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process firmly in hand by a closely controlled nomination committee by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates will be admitted "with love of country and love of Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most public-active protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
The Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement is behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, whose organizers have threatened to abandon the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine general electoral right.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters within a few hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that should take place only if all the dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all the dialogue opportunities have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were reinforced on Sunday in front of the government building.
The turmoil is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The access of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, fear is growing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement because it jeopardised the business operation - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to fear that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780.000 people participated - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen appearances with private aircraft are offered.
We look forward to being able to respond to this demand and to offering the first luxurious travel service of the UK to students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security detail.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to kiss their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesperson said that no new bookings have been made since the service had just been introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems totally separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are facing a crisis of living costs because the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the rapidly increasing bills for the simplest basis of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as coming to the student home.
Females criticize racial question and police behavior according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, for the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West rose and were received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "thinking of Ferguson from a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think many people are found in feminism who are white and talk about privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicated so that they have to express it.
For Professor of English Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to light, to which black Americans are exposed every day, but who are not considered "women's topics" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of cleanly separating the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the themes of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were limped and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's election rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for electoral rights could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to vote for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
Remembering such things will make you aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it lasted another decade until white women organized themselves against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for the help of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fangen" with the problems with which black women have been interfering for generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists, who have such traditional feminist platforms, took the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to control reception?" said Mitchell.
Second generation feminists who built their career on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception now try to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, asking for more protests by white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race, which are significantly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender themes are addressed, some of their comments on the racial theme in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks to Ferguson contrast with their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions by many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is in the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors have taken up the country's south-west border this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilises women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the topic as an essential theme of women, they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position in which they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a sequel to the women's organizations," she said.
"Swine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house standing for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - among which also a pig belonged that his head had bedded on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was accidentally released and has been removed," said one company spokesperson.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as an "unique single-bedroom house."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
In social media, house sales were of interest when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lottowink
A Harvey lottery player this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth will take on, with a lucky winner who will receive almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot for the second time in five years in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the winnings provide a conversational fabric in the small town in the southwestern part of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a win could come.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, one player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had only won the 7.5 million dollar mega-winning a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the winnings allow them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bathed in the Gladiatorarena
Not only the gladiators stood in the mud at the first Römertag in the amusement park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who were defying the rain showers and the autumn cold and were left completely enthusiastic about the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial arts force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in which arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator-owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for heroic two-fighting in various gladiator-types.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangle sign and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with breastplate, short sword and wort, as well as iron Gladiator's helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius", which struck against the "Secutor" with litter nets, drench and dagger, was particularly impressive and after a short fight the lads fell to the ground.
Because forces of the swords were metallic in each other, the shields were scraped, and the worms flew surrounding through the arena that could become a fear and fear for the health of gladiators.
But on those had the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, a always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman era revivable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "oppidum Romanum" was created from the amusement park for one day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
Finally, not only have the Romans brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of this were also to be admired on the day of the Romans, for example "Aqueduct marble" from the 11-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once contrasted the supply of water and energy, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit today from the knowledge of that time".
This also confirms the diploma surveying engineer Ralph Heiler of the "IngenieurteamTwo" from Rheinbach, who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocauste, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive, too, are the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the foothills of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Land Memorial Care Office of the Landesverband Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord commercial park in Rheinbach.
Walls of an economic building with a dart for drying grain and milling have been found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, a farm estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations she presented in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the Roman Rhineland at that time, Morscheiser suspects.
The children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names on wax boards, as did the Roman students once.
At the booth of the Roman thermals Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bark glass mosaics at the booth of the glass museum Rheinbach and use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at Eifel Nettersheim's natural centre to grind the flour for a flat bread or a muesli.
With the original remodeled Roman carriages drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the community of Wachtberg will also be attending the roman year 2014 declared throughout the Rhine, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor August 2000 years ago.
Together with the local and historical associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and the Roman past is reminiscent of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told of his work on the quadruple watchtower, presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman era and offering a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of watchtowers "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme within the framework of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans, which are often but no longer visible at first sight, are to be rediscovered in Wachtberg.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matronen Saint in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Burdens West Africa’s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go on a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are squandered - the virus has severely spread to the region.
Some international companies are already running at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, alone the fever fell victim to more than 600 people.
Recently, health authorities declared that the disease was at every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands more fell apart.
Foreign companies attract employees
Companies are using their operations in the rich countries everywhere.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers also react: few merchants still leave their homes to get supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot in the fields.
Farmers dare not leave their homes for the harvest.
Food becomes scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the West African economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and forcefully: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, supplies of basic food such as rice disappear.
At the same time, the heavily dependent region of international companies is facing an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time," says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors could have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest," warns Hugoon.
The disease also affects the strangled state budgets of the states
The disease also affects the already disrupted state budgets of the countries concerned.
The Moody's credit rating agency is afraid that their budgets are heavily streamlined by the high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oily region in southern Nigeria has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere many people are already at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also decline significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Schützenverein Tannenwald runs the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 6 p.m., there's a big Böller shooting.
Afterwards, in the large fiddle of the mood evening with the "Stoapafälzer Spitzbuam".
Blakapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Festival Service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the large consecration at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the award distribution of federal and Gauschießen.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is Berngau's Blakapelle.
The patronage took over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through exercise in the space shuttle and small calibre shooting".
The NS-Regime had caused the association to dissolve in 1937.
Only in 1964 have 19 young men again found themselves, who on April 30 at the Gasthaus Lukas have lifted the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult start time, in which it was primarily about finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the Gasthaus "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were plotted annually and the magic border of 380 rings was reached for the first time by Rudi Meier in 1980.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the membership numbers have also developed positively.
After the association room "Leininger" has no longer met the demands of a modern association of shooters, the then board of directors, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future home in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a working performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, Father Strasser gave the ecclesial blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gauschieschen, coupled with the solemn consecration of the new Schützenfahne in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of its founding.
A Böller Group was set up in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllers" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work last year, members of the association have modernised the rooms and the shooting plant in Berngauer Hof and thus brought them to the latest knowledge of the technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting services of the shooting association.
A total of eleven teams currently compete in the round competitions: six air gun teams, one air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose in the 2013/14 round of the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ALB) to the district league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as steaks, carnivals and royals, club trips and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time, after his right front tire broke in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better job and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart was driving a collision with Kyle Busch before the Sunday night of the race and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I went in with quite good hopes for a good result today," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit another driver in a ash race in the north of New York State and killed.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that the studies on the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made whether Stewart has to expect a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart was already shortly afterwards in the first 10 preliminary and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a reboot in round 122, brush hit
Car with no. 18 out of control after exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, where both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21th place.
Dance-joyed young people looking for
Simply try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to competition.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in the TV Jahn also create all day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays some groups have strongly decimated.
Now young people are increasingly being sought for a sport that is healthy and is having great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups by Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of the eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of the twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, Thursdays between 17 and 6 p.m. or Fridays between 17 and 6.30 p.m. in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, can be snooped into the training hours.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, from classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, social gathering does not come too short.
"We go to dinner, watch dance movies, and we've also spent the night in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dance, you can also snoop in one of the other TV Jahn offers.
Children and young people can always take part in lessons in children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop in class.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who likes discofox, slow-moving walkers, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango may come by and join us.
Bulgarian prison inspectors protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of receivables to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meeting between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continued, the Director-General for Criminal Measures informed Rosen Zhelyazkov of the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
The pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise in the Obecrains.
After heavy battles, which allegedly included Russian tanks battalion, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel highburg Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the Supreme Army without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists, on their own account, have again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in battles in the Donezk region, according to the insurgents announced on Monday Russian agencies.
Ships sunken by the Coast Guard
The insurgents also claimed to have for the first time sunk two boats from the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Sea of Azov.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, a speaker in Kiev told the transmitter 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported to have put several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk today, the Ukraine contact group meets.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a messenger of the separatists from the eastern regions should also participate in this.
In advance, all stakeholders used their appearances to announce their claim publicly.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a harsh break" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
The Russian side's documents and statements show "that they regard us as opponents".
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he would like to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to Russia and Ukraine, official figures have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is still awaited whether it will also send a representative to the discussions.
Ukraine has been getting no fuel from Russia for weeks because of the dispute over the gas price.
Last, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe receives about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Toll will come "very clear"
Now the chancellor clearly confesses.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
Hard-core concerns from the CDU against the car-maut have kindled the CSU.
After persistent resistance from her CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke a word of power for the introduction of a car mout.
"To make it clear, it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party chefin on Monday after meetings of the CDU committees in Berlin.
Merkel did not establish a detailed model for the time being.
In the black and red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal and is now working on it".
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its No toll on all roads.
Mr Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also involved in constructive deliberations for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also spoke to Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is examining its own concept to reward motorway investors with tolls - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the Cabinet.
The CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never expected to invalidate all district and federal roads," said North Rhine-Westphalian CDU President.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to discuss the issue again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU Landesverbanden Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background concerns that a toll affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition support from the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as failing in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said the party manager Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll the ministers fail". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignett obligation on all German roads that will start in 2016.
However, national car owners may not be burdened additionally under the Coalition Agreement.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the toll via the car taxes.
The model must not, however, discriminate against foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One Briton said she thought that she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few more years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure walk and curved toes.
Illness also suffers from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she'd sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and she'd die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell there all the time and everything took longer.
I was never able to ride with the other kids roller shoe or skateboard and was often rushed to school because of my way of walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretching her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and between that I would lose all my skills.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, otherwise you'd already be in the wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
Some genetic tests have been performed with her CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a firecracker since the closure of the former campground.
For almost ten years now, the former Münsingen area of troops has not been shot.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition occurs every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere region.
The pomegranates are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
An ear-suffering bang stops at the blasts over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen area, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area is the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere region, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated routes.
Taxation of businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax records for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the Washington companies were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to government and local positions in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue of $ 26.6 billion in 2012.
The company's government and local tax burden rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third growth year in a row after the several years of falling notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Centre, a tax group.
More than half of the district's tax revenues, 56 percent, come from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Marylands' income comes from companies.
Virginia earns 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Most of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say, which resulted in an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from major states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process also seems to be taking place in Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion of government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not so effective in Maryland in increasing government and local tax revenues, as here real estate taxes amount to just over one fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to offer the same services offered by other states.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase evenly in all three locations.
The increase in the district was 4.3 percent the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has, with 6 percent in all three departments, the clear least corporate income taxes (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9,975 percent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia requires lower government and local corporate taxes and, overall, a better tax climate exists than in Maryland.
The District has not been studied in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will decrease to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State's corporate income tax rate by 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in Washington seem to be better off, so they are paying more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure whereby most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase of the general multi-strike tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the German Government's cut in spending affects the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes for a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - is the urgent wish of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Vice-Parteise Secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the discussion, the functionant of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly returned to this concern of the Twelve-Millions metropole.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessen SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be listening to a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added during lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
This joy of life was already radiating to Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the functionant from Guangzhou came across with sheep’s gums, but with red wine served for food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity offer.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Parteichef Li.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," said the municipal politician.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow".
At present, travellers would have to take the detour over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate acquaintance of Germany, nodded.
Maintained partnership
The ludicrous vice-party director of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He entered office this year only after his predecessor had been promoted from office for corruption charges.
The local party manager Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the functionaries from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration imposed by Head of State Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is very unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a leading functionist in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the Guangzhou 9,000 kilometers away is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, they want to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, says Li.
The Joan Rivers family "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was sent to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but today her daughter hoped that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We all push the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were sent to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday following an emergency for cardiac arrest in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and carefully observed until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "most".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners, which are now on the market.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive from 1 September on a label where the buyer can at a glance recognize central data such as the equipment's energy efficiency.
For new cars, in the pollutant class "Euro 6" sharper nitrogen oxide values apply.
There is also more money for the scaffolding farmers: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information on Monday morning had reported: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because YouTube was widely suspected to acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared of course.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their brass pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", said an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser gives the (mostly older) games an appeal of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy became somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal did not come about with YouTube, as the company reported that it was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer sports to watch, it is difficult to understand the attraction that is likely to see others when playing instead of taking the control console in their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 o'clock in the morning, as she sneaks through resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spinster shooting him in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All these games could be watching you right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so seeing without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humor virtuosis, his switch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And what exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch could easily have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who have been recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch " both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on the Sunday evening at the Burggartenfest.
The idea of organizers was right.
Despite the strong rain shower on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the Burggarten.
In time, the intake had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sahraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is supposed to shine brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was shown early in the evening when the first visitors opened up to open air.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And that's what they did.
Around the utilities on the Burggartenwiese it had made Salzwedeler but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live appearances, flipped with the foot in the clock, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: relaxation pure and enjoyment was announced.
And that's all over the generations.
While the one on ceilings on the extra-carried white sand at the beach bar rang, others lived on a quarter of the wine in the Vinothek, the young people on the Hüpfburg raged, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when making children, the volunteers had to do all their hands in the truest sense of the word to become the master of the crowd and to enchant imaginative creations into the little faces.
The sizers used the kickers or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew set up from salted weeds.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he boasted of the visitors, especially families looking for the widest and dry place.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not stop.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why a repetition of the big party will not oppose anything in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still have to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday against the referendum.
As annoyed, he said that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security firm had been booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid were no longer on the grounds.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the saltweeder co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were rummaging in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The saltweeder hip-hop-band blocks`n`Rox therefore interrupted their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-wise sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt for a tire pan.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will have to be made for the first time, but must be removed from the second edition.
The organizers must also make criticism in the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more", says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it's very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hut off!", writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
The organizers will now have a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
He is not expected to be.
Instead, the ready-to-lay component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the space observation radar Tira, the case, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom with a diameter of 47.5 meters will be slightly smaller than the old one.
However, the size remains world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old case is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case is placed.
If the weather plays, the action should go over stage at the beginning of this week.
Contestant at the Ice Bucket Challenge, Kiefer's inconceivable
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her icy water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully next to it.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she could wipe out her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain creased so much when her icy water was poured over her head, that she violated her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was hardened, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and were laughing almost in their pants, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital to get the jaw back into the hospital after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the Burgvereins going to pull a string again soon?
Last but not least, there were times between the two Wolfratshaus Burgvereinen.
Now the executives think about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
One year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
So far, there seemed to be very different positions to deal with the history of Wolfratshaus Castle and possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving together: discussions about a common approach will soon be held.
The club directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested we could get together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both associations could once again move into a new direction in the future.
Thus, there would be more rapid visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until last had in mind the reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the "explanation and experience" of the site is at the forefront of the Burgverein around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with his own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been standing before the Burgundians.
A new chairman will be found in a meeting of the members in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently numbers around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the association activities rest from respect". This "think phase" was necessary to "consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president is to go to the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make a current mood picture within their group.
There is no candidate for the Presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to compete because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The culprit wants to continue working on the project "but very much."
The different positions in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as "Missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the population and voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become increasingly convinced that it makes sense to push ahead with the project. A "simplification feature" for the Flößerstadt could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"This is why I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein might move something on this point.
Their goal to first document history is "important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever Ways to Save at Uni-Teaching Books
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students amounts to more than $1,000 per year, the Fast-Second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever spadee.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick file A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management announced that students spend on average more than $1,200 annually for textbooks and study materials, but there were different cost mitigation options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
The renting of textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university books, announced that the renting of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college libraries last spring, said Neebo’s Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in Campus-Buchläden, according to the trade association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are available in the Campus Book Shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Purchase used
If one does not mind the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was recently sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
The renting of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the provisions of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply to the writing of notes, underscores or signs of use.
Renter careful: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Make sure you look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, says Gault, if the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had delivery time for four weeks and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't hit the cash register
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollars budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of its budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape" on Cameron Diaz only recorded 14.6 million dollars at the opening week, while children films like "Drachenzähmen made easy 2" also disappoint the revenue.
An article by Telegraph movie critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films itself could be the reason for the children's films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Drachenzähmen lightly made 2" as purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
In movies for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer film start, which was shown on at least 2000 screens between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinematographers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-appearing jungle book film, said to Hollywood reporter's website, "I think the times are changing."
We have to accept this and not try to trace the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood production, Netflix has recently achieved revenues with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics films and forecasting a "nuclear melt" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash registers to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was removed for streamlining the league division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the programme.
The result: Those who have not ascended have gone down.
Göttingen's highest-class team Torpedo has avoided the descent in the Oberliga-Relegation, but in the coming season only plays fifth-class.
Four-class women, despite their magnificent passage to the Regionalliga, remain torpedo.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxonyliga, as well as the boys of SC Wende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserves appear in the new Association League, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttinger Clubs.
With the ladies the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo-second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class of composition is now the new district soberliga South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the district league, as regional representative Dransfeld and SC Weende, play in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Upper SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district superliga of the ladies starts at least in Solstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wölllmarshausen are starting up in the district league.
With the nine teams
The SC Wende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league squad of the SCW-Jungen - where Torpedo II starts - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen started with nine teams each.
In the west stage are the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielehausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Staffel, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play among others.
The women's Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wölllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no women's teams at all.
Remarkably, none of the six 2nd-circuit classes achieves stability, here the innovative and exuberant circuit board will have to think about it once.
Nato Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from NATO opponents in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-nato march.
On Sunday about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-tip.
Stephen Fairclough has been following the developments for us on the weekend and speaking to demonstrators who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenages escaped from the Blue Mountains
ZWEI young Buschwanderers were secured with the rope winds after they were trapped the night over into the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man broke up for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
At about 8 p.m., relatives called the police when the two had not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had hurt her knees and the man had been stunned and had raised his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were evacuated on Monday morning.
They were delivered in a stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating Government Enemy Protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators had been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter resumed the radiation after more than half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with poles had damaged equipment in the editor's office.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the head of government to whom they have been accused of committing electoral fraud.
The police announced that about a kilometer away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were again clashes with security forces on Monday of around 3000 demonstrators.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured as demonstrators tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "to waste time and apply without violence".
Furthermore, the communication stated: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has caused concern for the intervention of the military, which has already washed more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have taken place since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan proposes to have won the parliamentary elections in May last year with fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are working to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had at first been peaceful in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them to move to Sharif's residence on weekends.
Hütteldorfer after second season win on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Valdag, Rapid has had a bitter week of reconciliation on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate level with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and gatekeeper Steffen Hofmann, who was driving third with green-white.
Schrammel-Träumtor brings Rapid on the winning road Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes with a success experience into the national game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership Volley from the 16th corner in the 14th minute, set the stage for victory.
"I thought I'd cut all the frost from Thursday and snolled it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schramme met last in a Bundesliga Party on November 13, 2010, this was still true for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory to him.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid-Agenzie," said Schramme.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term Becken-Blessur, Schramm moved from the left to the right defensive side and also made his case very good.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirrorfully.
He earned the gate, he already did some assists this morning," praised Barisic.
The team showed character Schramme also delivered the flank to the 2.0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written in.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," said Schramme, who used to point out that in the past few weeks, "the results have not voted, but the playful has always been good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games one was better than today" - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium".
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less pleasing to him: "That we finally played to zero again".
A lot of work during a country break The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures are to be regretted, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their debut debuts makes victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," said Barisic, who has lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players in the last three days, "who have been very stable lately."
Therefore, the country play break had to be used to " lick wounds and add a little bit in the physical field," said Barisic, who has five U21 electorate actors in his ranks.
One that the break is likely to be particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He's breaking up for the team. He's going through pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave Rapids the game not only the structure in the 68th minute, but also the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We must have had some luck, but someday luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He clearly warned to concentrate on further work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
We must not, however, believe that everything is fine now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much right now.
They keep up with me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Valdaig-Coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the rapid counter-trace "from the category Zaubertor", as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute, which had been rejected to injustice by fellow judges.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that in some phases we were not concrete enough towards goal.
We have had too little conclusions there.
Inside defenseman Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It just started badly, but then we found pure and even made a gate.
In general, there would have been more in it.
Under this tip rest prevails
We showed a powerful trunk in our puzzle task of the summer series "My Piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the specimen shown is the "noise" above the subwhite well.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes groups, Basaltstein heaps and Basaltstein lakes.
A piece below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of the area and reminds an American mammoth tree with an extent of over eight meters.
A little Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there were only indications of the origin of the names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has additionally consulted the Bishop'sheim Archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what a lot of people are dealing with the gunpowder.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goats’ shepherds are supposed to have driven their animals from the well of underwhites to the weary reddish pastures and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guardians exhausted from the ascent are supposed to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, in fact, goats feed again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
When entering the stone collections, however, one should be careful, for the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place for crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but there is something hidden.
Further paths are signposted, the direction of Hochrhön ascends and invites you to an extensive hike.
Where's the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle, which is searched for in our next task, is rather rare to be found in height.
The reflection in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Glück"?

After many weeks of exchange, Italy's Prime Minister and EU President, Matteo Renzi, has enforced the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit last week, she becomes the successor of Britain's Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government-oriented daily La Repubblica renders the appointment of his Mogherini as a favourite also in the government team to strengthen the position of the social democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to keep the desire on the left side of the party, because Mogherini is assigned to this party - albeit in a moderate way.
In contrast to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland, nominated as President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, the dominant view in Rome is that a political balance should be created.
At the same time, the EU's chief diplomat will be Deputy to the President of the Commission Juncker.
The approval of the EU Parliament which is still outstanding is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, which has been known for almost two decades in leading party offices and is known for its ambition, will be showing itself the "high-quality challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began with the doctorate Politologist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing democrats), which in 2008 merged with the Catholic centre party Margherita to today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became vice president of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
In 2001 she joined the Left Democratic Party Council in the high party policy, working in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head became her soon.
It occupied traditional areas of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a military quota, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's over 40 percent votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The prudence in Brussels, which the new EU External Representative has too little diplomatic experience, is therefore lacking in substance, is accounted for in the PD.
In Brussels, especially Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's distrustfully realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a "rustland-friendly course".
It endorses the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is to be transported directly to southern Europe via Russian natural gas through the Ukraine, which also serves the Italian energy security.
After Renzi entered office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow on her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken with amazement in Brussels, as well as that they invited the Kremlin boss to a Milanian economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training jobs, the new employees will be active in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Verorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday the trainees of all vintages as well as the instructors drive to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day walk and rafting on the Inn is on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed throughout the years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" to the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet transformation has come to disapprove of the great majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
The prime minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a relaxation of the regulation by Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, poured sand into the gears in which she appeared at a meeting of abstinent socialist MPs and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far right-wing leader of the National Front, mocked the permanent socialists' digging struggles and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the fall or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she would stand up as a winner in preferred elections and be ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was at the forefront of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking into several rival groups before the end of the 2017 Dutch term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve any improvement in the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, has advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to be able to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and in the next few years it is expected to strengthen the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice for cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $ 850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in 2008 in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, according to approval authorities, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have over 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the presence of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election.
The Chinese flag was not far away from a group of peckers.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the 2017 Hong Kong leadership elections.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee that is expected to be occupied by Pekingfare Members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and led pro-democracy activists to face their threat and to paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with Occupy Central protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's leadership fears that the call for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper on China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and Vice-Chairman of the Hong Kong Office and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in the afternoon in front of the Hong Kong leadership office.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not foresee any democratic elements.
Putin asks Kiev to take up "state talks" with the ostelraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, Russian media reports demanded that the Ukrainian government set up the fighting against the separatists in the East of the country and immediately enter into negotiations on the "state" of the apostate region.
His spokesperson Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of the Oshatras under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev Government to negotiate with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy that he had been pursuing since the outbreaks five months ago: aid for the separatists in taking areas and putting pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to be effectively independent of an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the areas held by separatists in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the occupied area "Novorossija" or "Neurusland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on October 26th and while government groups are hoping to attack civil communities in the areas held by separatists on early peace talks "are caught in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to enter into detailed discussions, not only on technical matters, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of the South East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the state must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months in order to disperse fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker on the correction of Putin's "feel interpretation" stressed Russia's claim of leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period gave a wide majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian legislation, after a new election, should consider additions to the Constitution, whereby the respective territories are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armaments and insurrection Moscow is accused.
Putin's last appeal to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed after a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks were invaded by the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the hands of Ukraine's security officials, who, according to fears, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have started to secure Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just ahead of a point where there is no more return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andry Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, reported on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included in Ilovajsk by the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australia Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn't make a heel for his troubles about hackers who probably stole naked pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecketo and a who is who the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal around celebrities.
The hacker is likely to have 60 nude photos from Lawrence, Star from "The Tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly also published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
The noblest, who had engaged with Grecco last month, said to Confidendial, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
According to a news website, Greko, currently in New York, said that the hack was "indecent" and that the people concerned felt "harmed".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two photos where she is upstairs without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sugar Punch were not available for comments on the hacked pictures yesterday.
A representative Lawrence said to TMZ: "It is an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but selling hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the reproduction of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer were with them yesterday at the 8th cycle on the Großen Feldberg and have therefore supported the association "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour, which was a torture for one, represented an easy training for the other.
But everyone agreed in one: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberurseler Brauhaus was driven yesterday by bike to Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the little muscle cat from it, especially since he had personally brought a valuable insight into his participation at the 8th Raddles on the Große Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt).
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - fine!"
Little fuss on the way in the applause basket?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants came to the mountains yesterday in the early days and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the distance between Hohemark and Feldberg, which is well over 11 kilometres long.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the circle day - red dress, red bike - did something about understatement at the start ("Every amount of professionals, there is the destination!"), but then turned out to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the target after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also drove through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press officer of the city of Oberursel, who had made his way together with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathletes, "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is about Charity, we are happy to be with it - we would have made an exit anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to trample right on to the height.
In the morning at 9 a.m., the Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung at home in the saddle, "made the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Also had fun "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk cycle tours over the Feldberg are simply included.
He had plotted with his 6.5-Kilo-Rennrad for 40 minutes.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of itself that he is an "ambitated cyclist".
He must be, because he was on the road with the "Fixie wheel", although those are also racing bikes, but without a switch...
The fact that it was also easy to go up without a wheel proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed up to the summit above the White Wall and the Fuchstanz, but also a jogger who pulled a tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad Bully and Quad, said, "I know him" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself." So the man is, to a certain extent, his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never - were sent on the route in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the club "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that the route to Feldberg will be able to block up to the safety of the participants.
