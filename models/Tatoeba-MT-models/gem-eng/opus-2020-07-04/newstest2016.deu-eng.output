Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also involve the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement building of Israel and promotes Netanyahu’s lack of will in the peace process.
The deal about the Iranian nuclear program, which Obama has committed, has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech that was sometimes considered to be an affront against Obama.
The speech was not given up with Obama, a meeting had been rejected with the indication of the Israeli election that was to be held at that time.
In an emergency call, Professor said he shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly trembling voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was scratched on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it backwards, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me". This was stated according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard shooting at 10:18.
He said that someday Lamb made the devastating emergency call after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamm took his life when the police chained him up.
One day after shooting at the university, the students and lecturers forced themselves to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said helped draw an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching bodies comprise 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a vacation for health reasons, saying that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the University's employment policy meant that the doctorate for which the Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to work as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in spring.
One of the long-standing friends of Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met together by friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's mother at the time.
All the girls melt there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss were together for some time.
In the emergency call Lamb said "I killed my wife", but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer annual market three years ago.
Later they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for different companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night last night September 5th after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmony game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no evidence that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
On Tuesday evening at Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mahnwache, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm called Prentiss as his wife in his emergency call, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to recruit fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there won't be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers who are currently working with him a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centers across the country. In the Christmas period 2014, 45,000 workers were still employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with applications and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated goose and an arm length away from being at a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "unquestionably the biggest time travel film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says that his answer to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five years of conflict, and more weapons and misery will only worsen for millions of people.
The UN Head once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join forces and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the end of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had shown in the face of the crisis in Syria in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Survey values that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have turned him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks of surveys down, it has not worked (yet) yet.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump in the double-digit field, and some start to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the voting period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win Republican nomination.
Experts stress that Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain at this time in 2011, none of whom won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to let her dollar flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by Monmouth University showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "annoyed" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they're "excited" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of the Republicans' Irish voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Even so, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their intellectual guardianship, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If they are asked who wins the GOP nomination sooner, after a survey by CNN/ORC from last week four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
That's a change since the time when four out of the 10 end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP selectors did not have the clearst crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final Mid Romney candidate.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beat almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership while anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffuse.
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-and-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points, ahead of Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-and-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given up their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change his mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico " rapists" in his election campaign two months ago, immigration was a turning point in the public discourse of 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will seem to do the same.
Frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for around half of the support of Republican voters, mainly through their external status.
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "dissatisfied with pride".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea.
In the street a square meter of a reet roof house on average costs 73.300 euros.
"On Sylt the offer of objects is naturally limited", says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations one square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square metre for a studentbud in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany's top residences, one of the prices is found like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residences - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are once several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square metre, well noticed.
But good, who can afford it ...
By the way: Munich is by no means at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern Dream start thanks to Müller and Göttze
Double gateguards in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the Hexenkessel of Piraeus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90.+2) and Götze's hits (89.) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th success in series is expected to be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
At his 28th match in the Champions League, Müller received the help of Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made a shot of the world champion thought to be a flank.
"We won't underestimate them," promised Bavaria captain Philipp Lahm before the Karaisakis Stadium in front of 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich people kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stumbled (1:3).
But the Bavarias, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were brave, but often too indiscriminate in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were launched too often by moving to the left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half of the square entered the upper left corner.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown hit Poland's headball off the line (26.).
Then by direct withdrawal, Torwart Roberto paired with his knee (35.).
Although the Bavarias performed their usual dominant game, Piraeus could put needlesticks.
At Torhüter Manuel Neuer, however, was abandoned.
For instance, when he directed a shot from Ideye over the latte (56).
Before Neuer, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero has only given green light after finishing training, said Chief Sports Officer Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something else out of it is already evil".
In the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to the beaten Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Muller put another one on it per elfmeter.
Before the game it had come to scratches in the stadium.
After a small group of partially mutilated Bayern fans had apparently provoked the fans of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and were fighting against the Munich followers.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
If you smoke, you have a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, you will not only damage your lungs, but also your teeth - this will suggest a Potsdamer's long-term study.
The good news: If you don't, the risk will fall quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of premature loss of teeth was higher in smoking to 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammations of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For this periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss therefore depends on more frequent gum infections in smokers.
The extent to which smoking also increases the risk for caries is unclear.
However, people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the threat to return to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, said Professor Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking reduces life time."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, leads to good dental health up to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 per cent of the population are affected by toothlessness between 65 and 74 years of age, the DIfE announced.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of premature tooth decay.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists bump into Cologne Rheinufer's remains from the Late Antiquity
Archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for repeated times.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-German Museum have dug out skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological monument care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it had already been known that instead of the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood, Trier explained.
In addition to remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman has failed at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police are asking the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the track from the station building at the end of the train path and was picked up by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she suffered most serious injuries from it, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on the spot and taken to a hospital by paramedics.
There is no knowledge of the reason for the nightly crossing of the young woman's tracks.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquired are residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident may be given under 24-hour and free hotline of the Federal Police on phone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
With a view to resolving the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The contested private conciliation bodies for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedish Government has proposed that the proposal be introduced as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU Member States and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to come from the EU, the US and third countries alike.
For the first time it is also a second instance.
It would allow opposition to judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, there has been no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, according to her own information, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
The investor-state-shooting procedures (ISDS) required by large groups in particular are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, by companies charging damages to taxpayers, by abolishing national laws, or by lowering consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact referred to the Commission's proposals as inadequate.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission took into account in the reform important points raised by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU Ministers for Trade.
The old system of private arbitrations was off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned that too many new rules restrict the appeals of the economy.
In particular small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it was said.
When talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement can be concluded, Wednesday continued unclear.
The negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US.
Originally, a framework for the Agreement should already be set at the end of this year.
This date is no longer considered to be sustainable.
Delicate folk of Suffjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a stick of felt.
The whole audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells about his minute and delicately arranged songs on the map, based on various places he is constantly on the map.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative wanderer.
With the 2003 released and third album "Great Lake State: The Great Lake State" soundly composed songs that can be harmoniously close to American folk of the late sixties, but can always drift into great opulent drift.
The rumour is that "Michigan" would be the first part of a seductive series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
This is where Stevens performs.
Live is enough for him to guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a widely celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overwhelming to ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises into the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in the best annual list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic offsets.
This sixth decent studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
When the smaller clubs escape, the stage shows will become the colorful spectacle of neon starbands and large fluorescent stage déko.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens tour as part of a five-member band through Germany.
In the dark, more Hamburger!
Theater he presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now banned in their chairs, Stevens, who have become more mature, returns to intimacy and to the people.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
One hears from the audience: The lecture is more "opulent" and one can thus throw away the "place basically".
First, Stevens thanks modestly, playing acoustically few older songs and finally bowing down under a great applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Mr. Corbyns' debut has been awaited since his election at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
The new Labour Chairman, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and join David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby.
He demanded "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip a few meetings to leave colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, because after his appointment she will come to the member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to stay silent on Tuesday during the national anthem's singing at a commemorative celebration on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory-MPs and is at the heart of several cover stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to himself
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said that he had "standing in respectful silence" and he had recognized the "hero of the Royal Air Force in the battle for England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national anthem "independently" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in business, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stumbling" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statement on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour had made changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
Hours later, Mr. Smith told the shadow-working and pension ministers that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he was Tory-Chef, who has been standing across the dispatch box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour President, who promised another political approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and more than 30,000 suggestions were given to him.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he is not only "moderate" and the struggle with restraints, but has instead focused on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Minister for Economic Affairs, will be represented if he does not participate - for example when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the word, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the spokesman of the Unterhaus, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to get rid of politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but several years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the hour of question with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House and his position among his colleagues in Parliament, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Guests in Joburg': homeless young people trained to photograph
The city centre of Johannesburg is a hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and get a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rising by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose jump by data showing an increase in UK wage growth, and in parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared with the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most estimated rate since 2009 of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and was climbed up to 0.84% versus the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed by 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20% after the acquisition offer of the Rival AB InBev was received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
According to encouraging news from the Competition Group for Luxury Goods, Burberry shares were 0.9% higher.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are showing renewed growth.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the mining farm said that it had taken $22.5 billion from a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment for the company Rating on "sales".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sportswear company had reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the semester.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, which could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a chicken with uppershoe hair.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
At present, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is turning around.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the polin sits on the cold stone slabs of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose poster is hung up in Stettin since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much on the day as her mama Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my vittoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the high school."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
A compulsory school?
Who's nuckt's?
Not the fans.
Neither do beavers themselves.
He's taken care of anyway.
For the advertising break of the Superbowls he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pimpel company washed many, many dollars to the beeber account.
And for every doll that looks like him and over the counter, Bieber also cashes.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're stuck on the window window window.
More than 100 million is said to have been paid for.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is finally just in the USA and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, does not interest the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does that.
Pegida Plakat brings Lebanese on kartoffeldöner ideae
Potatoes or donuts?
Both are going - in the Kartoffeldöner, which Oldenburg's imbishop Hani Alhay developed.
Inspired by the word "kartoffel instead of donner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spear.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartoffs instead of Döner", which he had happened to see on television.
Since then, there has been a barbeque in his shop, which is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been introduced to Lebanese patent office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a utility model according to the Authority's information.
So how much meat and how much potatoes the spear contains does Alhay not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Culinary international understanding is also a good thing for its customers.
Metcash launches soil resistance campaign to fight Aldi attack
Metcash tries to protect the IGA files from an aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distribute samples in IGA stores and sell shop owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to trusted customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after the opening of their first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states and will remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will decrease the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction at the same time on sales and margins.
The wholesaler, however, refuses and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by improving fast growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief business manager, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and shop renovation programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is often referred to as "Special Ks", came to the fore by the infamous clash of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, where Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen how he smashed a tennis racket after a seizure intruded a potential US-open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teen is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup Half Final against the UK.
Healy said, "One thing I'm pretty mature about is the fact that Thanasi, in my opinion, got a little involved in the fight."
He broke a beating when he lost to the U.S. Open because of a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a beat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances of Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around, he's got a great family around, and I think he's been treated a little too severely.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he is training hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right thing for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid part."
"First, we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the climb very fast, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the ramp light, in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and suspended the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to enter the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's country and Serbian officials responded with indignity.
For an unknown time, the people who had fled from violence stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants "open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian police.
Some returned from protesting food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "indisputable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collagen damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
However, ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, in the end, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU Member States would include another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on an early Brussels action or on its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto also said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major gateway to the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming refugees are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not refugees who are entitled to protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damage to the 4 metre (13 feet) high fence that the government had built along the southern border of Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences on convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process human data and press a crowd to penetrate there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, 27 percent (increased by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the Presidency, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic electorate.
More than five months before the elections begin, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion will determine which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has gained some profits.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moderates, but these advances have been reduced.
Her support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only down here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage with older voters.
Last month Clinton was in front of Sanders with a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections throughout the country say that if they were nominated by the party, they would support Clinton with enthusiasm.
A quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of the democratic electorate say that they are enthusiastically supporting Clinton, less Republican voters say this about their leading candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President casts a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of the democratic electorate want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not.
When democratic electors are asked who would be their second choice for the party, biden is at the forefront.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that bees would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to compete for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's advantage increases in front of Sanders, from 20 points with bees in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election, but this figure of 78 percent has fallen last month.
Biden is by far a second at this measurement, but the percentage that looks at it as the "chosen one" has increased.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about the eligibility.
As in the last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre-elections emerges as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features of voters of their party's pre-elections.
Most people view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the best match for the three candidates while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters of pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server will continue to be asked during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their views overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton’s general opinion, although 36 percent said that her opinion had deteriorated.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this is still a problem for her among registered voters in total: only 32 percent consider them honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also regard Trump as being not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades when guided.
Cut from the six tested candidates bids, Carson and Bush best with honesty.
A majority view Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes up near Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half the support of the electorate in the new survey, and others lose dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support grew by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well-reached in demographic groups and that Trump surpasses Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen to the bottom, from 10% support last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are on third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is increasing in surveys - he ends up with 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some sideways for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees hot.
Even if top values are measured only remotely, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimmers to find warm water.
A bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea is expected to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) announces.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east, they even reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood Members Stressed the Death of a Baruch College Neulings
Almost two years after a student died during a shaky ritual of a student relationship in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng brutally during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
Officials said he was burdened with a 30-pound backpack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911, after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, to Google his symptoms and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide Utensilien and basically put the welfare of the brotherhood over that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeated with blunt force inflicted injuries to the head, buttocks and thighs.
"Too many families were destroyed by the harassment of the brotherhood. At least one student dies every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in an explanation.
Brotherhoods and their members must be accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for murder of the third grade for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to make the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also bring them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates will come, and the house will be shaken, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to run.
A recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is bound to be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money", said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights, but we still expect too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the prevention of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the Fed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates, quite flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, head of investment strategy at Nuveen Asset Management at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote increases in interest rates.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the event of an interest rate increase in the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question of "if it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have focused all year round on an increase in Fed interest rates, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could allow an increase in this session, the futures trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all cycles of increase from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP growth and put pre-recession levels in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery," the report says.
In contrast, this is a distinctly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this has been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares if they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds coming closer and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stronger monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flater, credit margins have widened and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
Generally speaking, companies that do the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from it when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse, as a rising dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to react positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have on average exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see profits through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.

BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that it does something that the private transmitters don't do.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "damaged" and increasingly not to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "hidden" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lies far in front of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public intelligence.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And to find the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I also really think it's important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that working harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, however, which, during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, put the commercial rivals on fire.
Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC-wise".
He added that he wished that the company "find a hit from our own stable" when it next starts a series of entertainments.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on the payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased most slowly in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7 percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the recordings in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November has slowed down spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has grown, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August showed the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMG Sales Index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is incongruous, and we may experience that growth slows down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the neglect of turnover.
Experts believe that buyers keep their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers raked around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 spending a little more than £1 online was spent.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in fashion chains in inner cities.
Muslims killed in the crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia causes some of the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden Group to be put to the burden
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on Mecca's main mosque.
Grieving filled, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead made their last trip to the Al Moaissem cemetery.
The procession of mourning passed by at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a crane crashed through the mosque’s ceiling and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral, when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 betters who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already agreed that the Haddsch to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the crane's arm when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group is responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking news agency service did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company is prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman praised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddh, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the cranes and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also accused the group of non-current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia for decades and has taken over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an abject son who was abducted by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£ 174.000) be paid to the members of the killed and the same sum of permanently injured.
Other injured receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind it
This leads to the opening of 200 other screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lower their hammers and brush in favor of the use of qualified East European artisans who carry out the work in their homes
If you can handle walls skillfully with a hammer or brush, you are apparently a minority nowadays.
Britons are increasingly engaged in craftsmanship to carry out heimwerkerjobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices has now been overtaken.
Kingfisher is therefore planning to open 200 other Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q sales points.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men are superior to the employees.
She said it was necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We must move this towards a more balanced approach.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British FTSE100 index leading company, has also restructured her top team to reflect on an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in the half-year profit and sales after the group raised the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functioners of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to answer for unfaithfulness and tax evasion.
The defendants were not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with maladministration.
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation it had been crystallized that the defendants used funds from association accounts over which they were allowed to dispose in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact was chosen by the chairman of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had not at any time a property disadvantage.
The sports staff would have only paid off expenses compensation and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and where they had invested a lot of time and money had taken out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 Schilling (€ 44,000 in 2001).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Do we continue the club or are we locking up?" said one of the defendants, in the Bread Business Reviewer of the Financial Office.
He then decided with his colleague and fellow defendant to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We've put money forward, our life insurances spent as security at the bank," he said during the purchase.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, there can only be no debt made.
Furthermore, in the event of such financial success, the payment of the expenditure compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid out only years later, namely from 2003, when an increase was on the account.
Therefore, lump sum and non-detailed accounts also appeared, the former supervisor explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the disbursements had not been disclosed to the association in detail.
The association had not been interested in the financial event in detail, only debt freedom was important, according to the answer.
When, in 2011, a functional investigation against misuse of office began, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
That would have been a setback, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the respondents knew no answer.
Then he finally thought he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage recovery".
Why damage compensation?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant declared that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never caused any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of the tailor."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never paid a cent salary, he had only paid mileage and diets.
On diets he had charged 1,000 euros per month to the association, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide precise documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an audit, in which everything was deemed to have been properly assessed, they explained.
The second defendant had also received several kilometres of money.
All the corrections had been made in cash, he had to travel from his place of residence to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the examination of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strikes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel reduction that has been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will reduce additional jobs when the company splits up.
The positions at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its business customer division.
As a result, costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros) are to be saved, the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will result in a special burden of approximately 2.7 billion dollars, which will be due from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs which has been ongoing for three years has not yet been completed.
HP employed around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
The Hewlett-Packard stock yielded 2.3 percent.
The company with printers from the California Palo Alto is currently splitting up: The computer and printer business is supposed to be bundled into a new company today - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both shares are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A further disappointing PC set-up as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services increased the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, PC sales and printers declined by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.4 billion dollars.
As a result, the proceeds decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split-up and massive positions on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only recently responded that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more shops online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting operations in Iraq would largely be counterproductive: 54 percent agreed that 35 percent would agree.
The fact that other states fly air raids against the IS in Iraq and Syria finds 61 percent positive.
24 per cent, on the other hand, are involved in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian power-holder Baschar al-Assad rejected 51 percent of respondents, 20 percent being in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The fair will focus on connected self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility Connected" on Thursday.
The broad audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA Car Association expect about 900,000 visitors as they did two years ago.
Röszke: outbreak of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and waterlights at the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred refugees.
Euronews Correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
After that, a police line had been formed and behind the police a water shed was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officers.
The officials first started using unstopped pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
Lots of tear gas were sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now retreated somewhat pending.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from respiratory distress.
The Serbian police press spokesmen also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of the decision on interest rates for the US notes bank
The world watches when the U.S. Note Bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade interest has been raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, who was still thinking last week that the Fed will do this, now think that the Fed will stay a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since Fed set interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, managing employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small amount of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to stand up for an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m.
Victims left an apology at Delta State University
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed them on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "feeling" at the first murder and wanted to "he could do it unhappily," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University called 911 on Monday morning
and said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call centre employee that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will bother", but probably will be upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it backwards.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening, when the police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, which Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "three-way relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "damaged in the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "they don't go to jail".
When policemen picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University in spring 2015, as stated on the University's website.
Stars that have lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also reportedly has to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
I'm sure all of this calls for his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year will save the Lufthansa Group with a better organization alone.
150 of the world's around 1000 executives will cost corporate restructuring the workplace.
There are new negotiations with the pilot industry.
Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment was to contribute about 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost flight line is to be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Management Board team, headed by Carsten Spohr.
With the redesign, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees of the strong company has been complex.
The airlines were operating under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Cockpit (VC) pilot association, negotiations are to be resumed on this Thursday following the judicial strike.
That's what the union told you.
The topic of talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible "in one year with a forecast record result".
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the savings concept is "Wings".
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Eurowings Group's exclusive low-cost line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this caused the left defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the locker he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed fortunate to have escaped from a Red Card and the hanging of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I come back more again."
Related: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult something like this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foulspiel by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long for you to know it almost externally.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister of The Lorax, who published Dr. Seuss' environmental fable in 1971, decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All is nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the act of the book, presents instead a description of the film version of 2012, which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text.
"In the midst of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if the text submitted by Cameron was not yet suspect enough, it reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the act of the book. Here an anonymous boy, like the local environment, hears from the money-loving, tree-doing, thneed-stretching once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a shocking, snorkeling being, "who speaks in the name of the trees", is spoiled.
Most likely such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read out a child 20 times in a row.
A downing street speaker said that the text was probably from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
Coming to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the cadre that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out a foreign victory.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars of 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth is separated from the England test frame and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to let Adam Lyth go is, of course, difficult for me to analyze as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are oriented to results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I have said this before - players are their own best picker.
It would have been a long time ago to extend the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he hopefully knocks out more races for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test hit man gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only accusation one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in here, and he's a hit man I'm counting on.
He's an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very much.
He must get at least the same chances as before him, but this of course depends on the crewing in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat up next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a drummer can't beat there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil's candle from Cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He did three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the cadre as a back-up spinner, and in my limited association with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the batsman and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He's one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring a lot of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in harmony with the previous words.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used by the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
While some will not agree, Coaches and team promoters do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly by the heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy is in a low state by 2017
David Cameron's undeclared renegotiation strategy to keep the UK in the EU will be more in trouble with each day, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who has been very upset because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states are as deeply involved in various crises as the EU is now and not always satisfied with its own fault, Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they do not want to.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that it does not like it if it endangers social protection either.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie-Agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance will climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they will win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking outwards inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and shows that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened to the exuberant longsufferings such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will tear out a leg to help the Selfie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan non-helpful remarks, all in the SNP style, while the UK referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a pleite" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barone, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can remember little about Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro-opportunists, who made a name as an "EU straight-banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hooking foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but noticed that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum vertigo, because Blair had put the principle of the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press has never let this happen to him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he no longer needs time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's Boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue-color tendency and the wilder rites of Tory's small-englandism can say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Benny" Benn said on the radio and on television this week when the hunter fought in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow dancer was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father, on television, tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabin colleagues without going too far and losing his cabin jobs.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and MPs after all the reports at their closing session on Monday evening.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the strudel of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Labour's support for a matter of course in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities on EU membership - in line with their well-founded siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities on NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not launch a campaign to withdraw - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of purpose for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mistrustful voters - to make concessions to the British if all of this can be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded at the start of Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise public health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Basic Report" last month and described it as a "extensive review of evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in Lancet's medical journal last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE justified its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE's claim that "the best estimate at present is that E cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to produce their opinions on the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health whose managing director is supposed to have previously received from British American Tobacco Means (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared that they would receive funds from an E-Cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not provided, but there are several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which mention an industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in PHE's tobacco management.
The research work of the group "significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products to most criteria" wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims were previously responded.
He said, "E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies in his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from an illness related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former boss of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hits like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs that are probably seen by a smaller audience in hard-circuited time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC General Director, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or sending programmes that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communications Committee in the course of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should have your production at least on programs that others don't make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax fund program could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Actually, other channels would give their right arm for this.
I try to see how this should be public-law television.
I don't think this would ever reduce the BBC.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series running Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of hunting for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows like EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programmes "should go to the BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson said to the committee, "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-Chair David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review their Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain".
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example of this change in "informed, clarify and entertained" on public television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, of which he said that only a handful is shown on TV, and enter with commercial channels Alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction of the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers reading and writing brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Srekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fad worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their Motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it uses ultrasound on the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblowers and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with Optogenetics, a pioneering tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency ultrasonic tissue can pass freely and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the intended human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications may concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Show Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Pedestal joints tearing leg cuffs!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but do not leave a trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this display is a militant parody produced by Amnesty International for the world's largest arms trade fair, in order to bring the British government's readiness to embellish arms to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the font types of the London Underground and the DLR line's trademark, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will ride with the DLR ... Customers are asked to help at the stop of the gun fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ pack of inbus keys, of which is claimed that "access to about a third of the bus stop advertisements on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade spots greets the commuters on the subway.
The amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works with the graphic artist and voiceover artist who also works for free.
VCCP-Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the gun fair - by an empty space of the ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic soft corporate advertising, but "through the introduction of bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be done illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the Waffenmesse comes from the area within ExCel, where exhibitors embellish fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab announces an order from the US Army about "the AT4CS RS shot off by the shoulder."
This includes a "unique shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effects within the target."
Whatever it does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life in student homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It is tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "really said Marmite don't love or hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were set on fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, film-night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and reclaim their underwear.

Introverters receive a rough treatment at the university.
Her room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space boomer culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can regain the energy that I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a Komilitone of socialism is exhausted - and send him a text message instead.
Speak up: do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back-many, knocking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering home-made delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to get to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clawing of chickens is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but you try to be more balanced than my roommate, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't be making any noise that keeps people from sleeping or from work.
It is not just a question of being a decent person, but of being one of the people sitting in the glasshouse in the truest sense of the proverb.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if it was up to them to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5:00 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she had her own music spoiled, closed her door, and went to her three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student home?
Conversely, it would not be outrageous if you held a roommate for your future spouse, took care of her, separated from her, and then had to see her every day and perhaps live with her as she passes over all her common friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to reason a little.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between a ulk and mobbing is more fine than it seems.
A good trick is funny, but it only takes moments for him to become a boomerang.
Provide a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding - but never acidify someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close her door, and put her keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but thank her belongings on the ceiling no more than twice.
Houses for refugees, single-parents, low-wage earners
The real estate contractor Markus Gildner builds houses for people who don't have much money in the Eckental region of central France.
So for example for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low earner."
"I show how to build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will press the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how to create cheap living space quickly: he builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, a lot of refugees will be pushing the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
For the people remain to a large extent here.
In view of the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing over the next decades.
A completely banal, three-storey rowing house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The building lasted six months.
That is appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: By law, I've done my project correctly.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the pitch regulation.
Terrible.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a rowhouse needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities lacks space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you sharpen the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True: We had a boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built that could hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single parent or the low earner.
I show how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the download option and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they receive an error message that informs that the "software update failed".
To deal with the problem, users are recommended either to wait until the storm returns or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by reducing the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool, delete apps, and then reinstall it once the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be switched off in half way and this could lead to an interruption of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg only knows one issue in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
Before the start of the World Cup, the WM-Tweet emphasized to the decisive seven overseas races "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The British already won seven of the previous twelve seasons and also attacks the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brite won the race.
Whether the current Smog in the City State will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a dark bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" was founded three months ago and has included another member in its ranks, increasing the membership number to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen on the spa.
Gauselmann is a member of the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that President Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot apply the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent research are also to be pursued.
Gauselmann wishes to see membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" as an expression of his commitment to the spa town.
Quartiersburst is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consulting, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center.
More precisely, the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, from now on, seniors and looking for advice will receive information on questions such as care insurance or benefits of health insurance and care insurance funds.
For years, with our outpatient care service, we have noted that often nursing families are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Also, many cash benefits are not used because the complexity of insurance is not yet understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the citizens' hospital as well as for the ambulatory service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The saludis were taken to the boat for this purpose.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as overthrow prevention, memory training or physiotherapist treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and reha.
Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described "The Senior Care and Care Centre".
The reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city center is particularly evident in demographic change.
For this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration celebrations, the Quartiersburo also devoted itself to the association at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
Thus, the Social Foundation makes a great contribution that seniors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 14pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 16am to 6pm and Saturdays from 10pm to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg v Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: after the date for the FC Eintracht Bamberg match against the third-ligist Würzburger Kickers had not been set for renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the date was now set as the 6th of October.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the Eighth Final of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third league player FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6th, at the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium at 7 p.m.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the card pre-sale that has been launched.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party league.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special attraction.
In 2010 FC Eintracht Bamberg won the first FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home against regional ligists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2) in the round of the last 16 teams.
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Vereinspokals 2016/2017.
The title defender is a third-party defender of SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died already on September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the treasury in Vienna's Hofburg and to rebuild the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park Penalty: Tim Wiese recruits policewoman with money
Tim Wiese, ex-footballer, got noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, in the meantime Tim Wiese, ex-Nationaltorhüter is engaged in Germany and Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass, according to his own statement, he wants to have increased over the past two years.
On the other hand, he did not give up intellectually.
In the city centre of Bremen, Wiese was just cutting his hair when he saw a parking guard exhibiting a penalty ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then rushed out of business, insulted the officer and threw the fine at her feet, as the "image" newspaper reports.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still under examination," it says of the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not meadow is displayed.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the growth of the marijuana plants.
Since three days, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evenings, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the Bft facility.
On the premises of the gas station there were also three people.
One of these men now shouted to the youth and slapped him with the fist in his face.
The victim suffered a nostril fracture and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends came here and spoke abusively to the butcher, he initially left off his victim.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car to their home and went there demonstrably several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the butcher and another male person.
With the help of a bat, the victim’s face and thighs were strangled.
The injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical attention.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second hit is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and informers to report under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euros
Silvia Müller-Gongolll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
The mayor of Samtgemeindemmeister Bernd Bormann, Wirtschaftsförderin Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Bürgermeister Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased.
In many places in the countryside, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is fortunate: Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen's practice on October 1st.
As Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be with his successor in the next few months with half a place left.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 31,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongolll, who is currently attending their medical training at the Verden Hospital and is also planning to enter practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The Muller couple liked the idea of operating their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years".
As an advantage he also sees being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The father-in-law Frank Müller also grew up there, following his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior notary in the district of Diepholz and volunteered in the DRK stand-up of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to settle down as house doctors.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongolll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speech room more.
In addition, the EDV will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of 50000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) and from the community (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasizes mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongolll, approximately 2000 patients come to Felstehausen's practice every quarter, with the average practice in northern Germany being about 500.
There is another home medicine practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have left too.
By the way, if you visit Müller's speaking hours, you will continue to look primarily at familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their departure ends in Asendorf an era, after all the doctors have practised there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms", Ursel Felstehausen recalls.
After a long time, she felt a little sadness.
"But we're still living in Hohenmoor and we're sure we're going to see a lot of patients," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughingly: "We have a 6,000-square-meter basic piece."
"I've always been pressured to do gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and loves to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being driven up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leiter.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum request can also do so "of course".
The care and safety of people is in the foreground.
But also, "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenia border.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia considered "Corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also like to send refugees to Austria and Germany and perhaps also build corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case with Minister of Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia would rather intensify border control, especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, has already been heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to block its borders for refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia by the border crossing of Tovarnik/Sid in the night hours of Tuesday, in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick it up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been operating ever since in Croatian Tovarnik.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects some 4,000 refugees, said Minister of Interior Rancho Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday in agreement.
However, the government in Belgrade disputed that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "We can neither, nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid had arrived in the early days, and more buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling through Serbia all night from the border of Macedonia about 500 kilometres away.
"We've heard that Hungary has killed, so the police told us we should drive here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could in fact result in a somewhat further west-facing route for the displacement of the existing Balkan routes to Turkey-Greece-Serbia-Serbia-Hungary, predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Extensive options for border control"
Croatia's Minister for the Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "wide possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, and the EU partners have since given a good witness to the country in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees continue to be trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm off Wednesday morning with a local eye-catcher in Horgos: he held debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers Adopt Migrants - Dangerous - Alternative Routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not, however, dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also minefields still not cleared 20 years after the end of the Croatia war.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of miners in the border region had been sent.
Stock market hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals that is accused of constantly gaining insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information being used is intended to have been made insider business on the financial markets.
According to this, over 100 million dollars were awarded to the investigators.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz reigns.
People do their concerns, some quick steps, some comfortable buzzing.
They drive the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at the parade square.
Hold the city lanes.
Pulsating, boastful life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large tables each with the heading "Before I Die I Want to Die"....
Ecumenical hospice aid drew attention to its 20-year existence with this action and is clearly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is available to the passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteer staff.
While some a passerby takes to the chalk spontaneously and the sentence "becomes my life", "can read", "go through the USA with the camper", "stop the war" or "not long suffer" added, others stay short, read, say sentences like "so far as I'm not yet" and then go on.
On the verge of small discussions about the action itself, about life, dealing with dying, are constantly developing.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
"Only when I realize that the end will come to this world for me at some point can I live responsibly," says the director of the deaconian work Mannheim, who is jointly with the Caritasverband carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this 20-year-old public action would be good.
The fact that everyone does not want to communicate publicly on the tablets, however, is understandable, and ultimately it is a very personal matter.
The theme of death and death remains with Tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and grief accompaniment is one of the first hour's volunteer workers.
Personally confronted with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to join the death aid.
When Ecumenical Hospice was looking for volunteers by phone, she had immediately registered and had been there at the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who are involved in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospice Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle their task and experience.
"I see the life of another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free and non-confession-independent.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of death and grief victims.
Every two years training courses are offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There too, other personal requests can be listed on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial prospects reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in the Premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a factset survey.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases, which average 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher increases in soil transport of heavy and large packages, which will be charged from November onwards.
The company said that it nevertheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, who plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31st, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zack's interviewed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has reported a decline in the international priority shipment in recent years, which caused sales in its Express shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, soil transport sales increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically low due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result was reduced due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the Premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, the Federal Reserve Streets spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it is time to raise the key interest for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at an end of the decorated two-storey meeting room there is a wall image of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will put the nation's economic interests in front of everything else.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximising US employment and prices keep stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predicting it. On Thursday it will be announced whether the US economy is ready to start, to be deprived of the unprecedented incentive by the near zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly, the latest turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomien at the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to wait on," she said.
There is no consensus as to what the Fed will do, which in itself insecures the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strands mitigate the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chefekonom at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "she had to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed in a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that, despite the complaints from Liberals that more economic progress would be required, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation remained below the target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and need them because of labour market tension," said Ian Shepherdson, Chefökonom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have to pull the reins during this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. node bank employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get better grips with the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the Fed, therefore it should not be technically included in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed Monetary Authority has become the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then director Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "encourage" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envesnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the fundamental economic data."
Lacer, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who advocates an increase in interest rates, quoted decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "with a very limited apparent impact on growth in the US", said Lacer.
A year later the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest fixing committee.
The recent turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are upsetting," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should prejudge time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/campaign was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central contact point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car division if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express for you.
The Garbüche (good and affordable) in this store is close to the cash registers and has various take-over options.
What there is here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are affordable and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fill the fish and even fry on request for you.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and Galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef and gall, pork-natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
Preparing for a warm welcome will not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still loves to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum applicant's home on Dillinger Straße.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a proper school.
Brazilian pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to shockingly tell women about how important good nutrition is during breast-feeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietetic adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernieder Sporthalle
The Bernried Municipal Council approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flattened for solar systems.
Planning for the long-awaited gymnastics building at the Bernieder sports grounds is progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated building request was welcomed unanimously without major discussions.
Previously, the board had decided, inter alia, to apply for a building statutory "exclusion" or "liberation" from the valid construction plan.
The "exclusion" involved the permission for a special form of roof construction.
Thus, a "satellite roof with a non-middle first and roof surface" is to be built.
The planning background is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems: "We get a wonderful large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the "liberation" it was again about the roof inclination, which is to be less than ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow for "exceptions" in relation to the roof inclination - where the Bernieder municipal council is usually more restrictive in the case of applications for exemption.
However, this is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost.
Grants are expected from school and broad-based sport.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction request for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now submitted to the Office for Examination.
Pissenberg Clinic moves to Schongau
The Pißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of the employees move from Pißenberg to Schongau.
This includes the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which the county council confirmed Andrea Jochner-Weiss.
However, a decision will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will take place on Wednesday 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the almost 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pißenberg.
The vast majority were to move with fishermen and the further existing inner station to Schongau.
The rooms were available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
The employees were informed of the plans.
Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongau Hospital since the beginning of the year, has triggered the change and is now changing to a private practice near the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and change to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau this meant in any case a "evaluation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "Inner Medicine", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the internal station.
For the next two years, when the Supervisory Board agrees to lead both houses, fishermen and their team will be finally closed in Pißenberg until next year, the former hospital of the scarcity, which still has 35 beds, is closed after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiss, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, has spoken against rumours that in future the house owned by the Federal Disability is to be used as accommodation for asylum-seekers.
As the property continues, Jochner-Weiss could not say that there are several considerations.
Currently there are a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatric.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," says Fischer about the quasi-transmigration to the Lech, which was "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
There has been no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongau's colleagues to take over the post of the medical director.
The Pißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth control.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required tonight (20.15 hrs) at the Bergische HC.
Although the leader of the Bundesliga table is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, there is no reason for presumptuousness.
In the last season, the bathers at the BHC suffered a painful defeat and have something to do with it.
Jagdunfall with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers have been severely injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the aberntens on a cornfield near Pratau (Wissenberg County), several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could come about was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violent Crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who have been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted that they killed young people and threw their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old who has been missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as the prosecutor and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, according to the deed and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she did not come home as agreed after a visit to Rockenhausen on the night before.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first encountered the victim's personal items.
In the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, a suspicion of the 20-year-olds finally arose.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the detainee admitted in the police interrogation, the 16-year-old killed and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be introduced to the referee on Wednesday, and the investigators put death at his fingertips.

Refugees Need Accommodations: Study Warns About Housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that has already been overburdened in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable dwellings.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 each year.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association "Social Housing".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This leaves 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation.
Many then enter the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also represents significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany has a housing deficit that is increasing year by year.
Currently, some 770,000 residential units were missing in the conurbations, lamented Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many workers therefore lived in major cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults stayed in the "Hotel Mama" involuntarily because of the mood on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head has for the first time fallen again in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a reboot.
New incentives for the construction of social housing should be renewed.
In this way, the basic industrial tax could be waived and the basic tax on supported dwellings temporarily suspended.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation for the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be stepped up.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up Corridor
After Hungary practically no more pass through, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the passage across Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border with Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which entered into force the same day, also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic stated: "You can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police had taken the first refugees on the border with Serbia to become the EU's neighbouring country Croatia.
According to most media reports from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
Although refugees do not cross borders on the Croatian-Serbian border, they do not.
There are other dangers to the borderline: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Minenraumer is now about to create a safe passage.
However, after the border is closed, little more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Just before gate closing on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws spelled out the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a criminal offence.
Thus, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The defendant is threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, 94 applications for asylum were accepted on Tuesday in the new "Transitzons" established at the border, almost all of which - 93 - were the most important crossing by Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees would have stopped there.
In practice, however, no one has any more prospects of getting asylum in Hungary.
In Hungarian terms, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be put off there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered before the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke workers began clearing up this.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the road in recent weeks.
Lockers were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to express themselves for the purpose of this transformation.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary has been closed.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
However, around 20,000 migrants remained in the country after government statements.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train from there to Germany was stopped on instructions from German authorities in the morning.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "Beached" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent with suitcases," says Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was in Wernstein's end for them," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the Nahe Passau.
Previously, we first tasted the unexpected guests, with jause and drinks.
We just said we'd take her by car to Passau.
"That was natural for us," says Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not afford to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening in Wels, the stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train direction Passau to try to cross the border after the short notice that rail transport was stopped in Germany.
However, the regional train was parked in Wernstein am Inn in front of the border.
In Wernstein the crossing is generally high in the course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociable, the day before a two-bridge course sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us other gypsies is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of assisting in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity immediately in Röszke's camp, our Federal Chancellor has moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dark circle of National Socialism.
Suffering from this policy are not just those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "promised land", which invited them and welcomed them, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for those seeking protection in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter.
And it will be an even bigger one - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter stables
Konrad has all hands to do with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre Traiskirchen has already got into control of Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees, who had come to Austria on Monday, had also been done without great whirlpool, Konrad said, praising the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total Konrad expects 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the national leaders.
These would have assured him that he would also have created quarters for the future refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, explaining how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
Private people can offer uncomplicated accommodation on the platform.
In addition, we hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In emergency times, it cannot be that quadrants must maintain a certain amount of towel holders or size of the upper lamps.
"Note standards" should be applied for a limited period of time.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior he was more successful in accommodation, Konrad explains with his experience.
I am an older gentleman who is not told the untruth in the face without delay.
Convinced is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number to three to four.
So far, the search for quarters has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there seem to be problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For now, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further sites are to be tested for their suitability for the emergency.
The head of the city is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Limits are not locked off"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday to proceed further on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be shut down.
The journey from refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, the searchers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Mr Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the refugee issue from the other EU Member States.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the action of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has been moved in and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative technology companies.
"In IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to make them work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later acquiring some.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the federal government.
The building is leased to S&T and Techcenter by Linz AG for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters remaining space in the building has already been rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia-Peroni-holder opened second store in the Arkade
Furla handbags are at the centre of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to lay a dog.
This project had to be postponed in a short time by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Doubenmarkt-Arkade: Finally, she has now grown in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop in front of the store, where they sell, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing of various manufacturers, everything revolves around women's handbags of the Furla brand, wallets are available from 75 Euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
Previously, it was rebuilt for several weeks.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store," says Breit.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also engaged in the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Grand Room Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots.
Her fashion interest got Breit put into the cradle from her mother.
I do most if something develops and I can show new trends at palatable prices.
Why some women get embellished at the sight of a beautiful handbag, the specialist woman can't answer with the last security.
Maybe it's because a nice bag uplifts every outfit.
The Brolljesmacher from Kallstadt
The parishioners of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called narrators.
This property may also be associated with the billionaire who wants to become U.S. president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobically, he treats journalists rudely, or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Presidential Office strongly stirs up the campaign.
And cut off well.
This is also recorded in the Palatine Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some people in the 1200-inhabitant place are related to it over-twenty corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatine: Donald Trump, here in election campaign mode.
Simone Wendel, the cold-townr, shot a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the world's most powerful man?
"I think they find it kind of exciting, but in their Kallstadt kind they are not so deeply impressed," Simone Wendel says.
The native Kallstadter has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous explosives, among which, besides Trump, the ketchup family Heinz counts.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also mentioned in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful even if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, the opinion tends to tend to be that Trump is "a bit of a big mole," says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the district is "Die Brulljesmacher" - zu Hoch deutsch: die Angeber, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the narrators.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a facility for gold graves in the USA.
The first purchase of property in New York was the foundation of the real estate company.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland on a permanent basis failed in the Bavarian state of which the Pfalz belonged back then.
He did not take Trump, because he had once resigned without permission, the director of the Institute of Pfalzische Geschichte und Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump was the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken apostately about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Like the poltert, this is not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The retiring winemaker sees the American rather remotely, "he is always so beautiful".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm, like some call cityrs, mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he did not choose, because "it has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had the case at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will be ripe even without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinematographers, also in the U.S. the interest awakened.
The Upper Bavaria municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the vice-president at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 resident village in the National Park Berchtesgaden received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may not have more than 2,500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurry to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but there has been no major shift in the reviews for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the state capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television programmes, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 330.000 of Sunrise in August.
At the beginning of the year the distance ranged from 40,000 to 50,000.
Until September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers of 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently wet father who decided to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and hit slightly The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30am to 18:00) jumped on 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot-Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half of the hour set 720,000.
Hot-Seat averaged 620,000.
Nine will confidently vote for the decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia that the Hot-Seat will finally be enforced at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to overflight the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Uncovered Secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly seen who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, where Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor, was covered in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before three of them will, you may have accidentally given a clue about who will be the winner.
Sam Wood will keep his lips sealed until the final on Thursday.
All three women have fallen silent about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as the reason why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should receive Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the game destroyer, who won the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both called Mackay the best partner for Wood quickly - except themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it is so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw her together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay told her that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood could be one.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who should choose Wood, if not, she was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a Gerangel as did the Aussie Rugby-Liga-Convertit at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also to the ongoing game after an injury from Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookes before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
==References====External links==*Official website
The 49s sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missing catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne followed a point that was restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start, Hayne and his massive Australian support for his NFL debut.
Hayne fluently left the field after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That's a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a passport in his own in-goal area led to a Try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested with arms on a Siberian rolling field.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, seized his oil company Yukos and subjugated his democratic efforts.
Free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and political group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt against a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Unfortunately, we will have faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtag faction of the Free Voters meets in the Lower Franconian Commune until Friday.
Actually, very different main themes were foreseen.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voter meeting.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will override the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they had been during the Yugoslav War in the nineties.
"That's not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Voter CEO.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum prosecutions: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The head of the FW criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states throughout Germany."
"Bayern's moving, other's not."
"There we have to be more able to act."
But national policy in Greater Wallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Medium level plus" at 47 upper secondary schools, during which an extension of the upper secondary level is tested from three to four years - in the end it will take again nine years to the Abitur.
But that's not going far enough for Aiwanger.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We call for freedom of choice for all the gymnasiums who want this.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Firmer Wall Street helps Dax on the jumps

Infineon shares increased by another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to a dealer, a positive report of the U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" had an impact on the weekend.

4 people killed after police shot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head district officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they pulled back on rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, of which it is known that although they can kill, which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last week of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent conflicts since 10.
In August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city
The property at Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-metre flats.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in direct neighborhood to the Youth Centre Old Post.
Preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
You wait for appropriate offers, it is called on the side of the city.
Which investor is inquired of is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The town of Emden had bought part of the property located on Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße a few months ago and had it torn off.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the cottage settlement at the small sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some laymen are still worried - they fear selling out their leisure premises
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, groaned, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new cottage settlement on the small sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized company "System Building", presented its plans publicly on Monday evening in the Council's Urban Development Committee for the first time.
Originally, this item had been included in the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction, which had been working against the investor and the management of mystery cream, Ralf Behrends went from the system building management to the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all questions yet," he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months.
The images and new details of the desired hotel building were highlighted by the intense reactions among those who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the seabud and member of the board of directors in the interest representation of the Anlieger, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a giant lump that surpasses all the other buildings".
In addition, like several other project critics, he fears that the planned size of the plant would greatly increase traffic: "There must be a whole bus charge to make it count," says Schulz.
What happens exactly on the good acres of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the building plans were still variable.
Zwillings-Nachwuchs bei Gorillas im Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased about young people with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diana has brought twins into existence yesterday.
Twin births are rare for Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The gender of newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Diana has so far kept her close to the body.
First, the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for Zyklon south of Cape Verde islands
On Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted a broad low pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, adding the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign that is to spend $11 million on humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when announcing the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"As part of our journey, many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear, were included," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on google.com/refugerelief.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya torn by war.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, Adipositas surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been shown to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are obesely obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
Here you can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained at approximately 29 non-surgical diabetes treatments.
Among those who had surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% in part.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely dissolved only at one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the blood levels of hemoglobin A1c in patients, which reflects the blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level dropped from approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas traction group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved major decreases in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and recorded a complete overcome of diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was probably 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years in the case of obese people who underwent obesity surgery, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit in the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, "without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is becoming increasingly important in Belletristics: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets her youth's Swarm again after years, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "Actually we are not like this" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the history of love, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, for he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she could set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not absorb all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the cessation of violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"In order to care for several thousand refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how killing in their countries is being reduced.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush's action following the terrorist attack of 11 September and showed that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four fold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting toxic control centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children come to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency department," Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a sample of social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol - containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially in young children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University Hospital of Kansas, the transmitter Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let whisky get around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when kids come to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four syringes of perfumed hand disinfectant to strawberry in school, was put in an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold considered by an adult to be drunk by law, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency medication doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watched them at night in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaiah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with death.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfectants that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health workers suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as active substance.
In January, three fourth class students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the classroom," a police report reported.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and exiled them from her room.
The police considered the foiled plan to be "spoiled" and directed disciplinary action to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In the event of a collision between Nordring and Herdenen on the cross-spange, a 33-year-old driver was easily injured in a collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-spange towards roundabout industrial area and realized too late that two prefabricated vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he hit the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed it onto a Ford Fiesta standing there.
In the case of the accident-related vehicles, damage to property of about 10 000 euros arose, the police inform them.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready and had to be dragged off.

Griffiths plays down Gede over Disharmonie
There are rumours of disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. This insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table guide.
I don't think we're feeling pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement in the old company games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen followed, who now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points.
But Dela said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Getting together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was aiming at some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new entries and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
The ex-head of Brentford said: "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal instructions
Swansea storm Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, has suggested that he can withdraw when his contract expires at the Swans.

Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was corrected after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about Ex-Heart's player Rudi Skakel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding, "it's safe to say that I don't go back to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management

Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points in front of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half-time.
McInnes said, "There is no team that won everything in trophy games or leagues that have not even won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as shown by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now falling to 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunken people disrupted the course

Why I'm going to witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see a man put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a spectator's gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison shot.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was first made in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since more applications are often available than places, a palatable lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will observe it emotionally.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining about her.
She admitted that she could've formulated it better, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you're getting from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessarily.
Man after wet police pursuit persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "speak him gently to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a housewreck incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I can't get out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
The championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car to the graves to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to stop racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching for a race day trial, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt competition at Lidaris that he could not explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage accusations and didn't want it to "be like too high-hanging grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out all at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"An 18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stable," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly grasp their noses because they have failed in trying to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still there today.
Should this make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now makes her think about it.
But I have now arrived at the point where it doesn't matter to me, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I'll put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The degree of frustration of the coach has been built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeatable master Black Caviar, described the racing-day treatment rule as "lying" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly put mud on my leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it also had it on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day. An examination of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's flight
The police arrested a man on weekends after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was handed in with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Autobahn.
The police said that the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday a 50-year-old man from Nathalia met the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of driver fleeing and failing assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Strikes Rivals for Claims for Ring Fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has referred to criticism of his players' tackling as "Agenda Setting" by two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the storm players to "run" with his team during the high storm win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled remark to the Storm team after his team had won the final win against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "muster example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's gratitude and said that they were only focused on their "contact" in tackle.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident that he would agree, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This is happening again and again - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talking about ring fighting when they hit us at 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we've made our contact with Dankles a real focus, and that has given us the trend change.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to losing, so it was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this is happening again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "stressing football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long-term" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I am building more confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about playing against us.
They probably didn't think about us six weeks ago when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points a bit exciting?
It's the game plans for me.
When they mention us, it means we're going to meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening in the preliminary final at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbs with $200,000 deposit after drug charge
A man who may be threatening a life sentence because of his attempt to gain possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and settled in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his fellow prosecutors in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long penalty for attempting to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire quantity and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of flight at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in order to obtain his release.
"After reading the oath-making statements of the two persons, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he surrendered his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police daily and held to a curfew of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Führerhaus tears apart
In the event of a collision with three trucks on the 5 motorway at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to dodge left at the last moment, as the police announced.
The guide house of the cause of the accident broke apart completely.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked over six hours to 2 pm.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure paedophile to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of inappropriate pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered "related" web searches that used terms to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then "promised to be a policeman to frighten them".
State attorney Eilith Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court, "he said it was a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to be a policeman to scare paedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person, who sent the pictures to him and whom he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the improper pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computers and playback to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment of having taken illegitimate pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the conditions on 25 January of this year and not to have appeared before the court at a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" can be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted bail, but was held in custody for hearings to other outstanding cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Slusers vary on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken up beyond the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many locks caused fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller crossings
On the Austrian side, a spokesperson of the Federal Police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been captured in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were on foot over bridges and dustweeches on the German side.
There they are received by federal policemen and forwarded to registration.
According to federal police statements, significantly more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station at the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8.00 a.m. alone, about 700 people arrived in the capital, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Tournament of Tropensturm "Henry" expected in the Southwest
Meteorologists warned of storm arches in the southwestern part of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, hot sea air flows into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The deep is the foothill of the tropical tower "Henry", which has been pulled across the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance are expected to last until Thursday morning with guilds of 60 to 90 hours.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again longer.
The mass makes it: Every two years the car builders at the IAA show their innovations.
In 2015, especially there is movement in the compact cars, which currently sell particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: approximately 28.1 percent of new registrations were made on this segment alone in August, according to the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (Publisstage 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars, this year many new compact models will be presented.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is Opel Astra, who will be with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel offers a view below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at €17 650.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, among which three-cylinder gasoline engines are also included for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitions VW Golf and Ford Focus, Opel Astra is first only five-door.
The second variant will be followed in the spring by the Kombi, which can be seen on the IAA.
And what is going on next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and a highlighted sporty GT version.
He will be traded at the beginning of next year, then also as a Kombi.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan alloy wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the brand's design line.
The base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm) according to manufacturer's specifications.
The launch of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën fan mainly put their hands on the front part: Here the cooler grill was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a series of reviews and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are being gathered at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin brick: Five square meters cell are unworthy of man
The Federal Constitutional Court gave a court of law to an ex-Häftling of the Tegel Court, which had been housed in a small cell for months.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were confined only a few days in the too narrow rooms (e.g. 1 BvR 1127/14).
With this, an ex-Häftling was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was accommodated in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space at the Berlin-Tegel Court of Justice between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now on his own free foot had been transferred to a larger cell.
He failed to comply with his official arrests because of the unworthy conditions of imprisonment against the country of Berlin.
However, the Constitutional Courts lifted the Berlin Chamber Court judgment and referred the case back to it for further examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
The Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention were relevant to compensation, a compensation claim was called.
Otherwise, "a confusion of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared".
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of punishment.
So in April they only told a prisoner a compensation because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, human dignity is also the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet.
On Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a person-unworthy accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009.
The plaintiff was accommodated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case over three months.
The Berlin prisons have also entered the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
Therefore, prisoners are repeatedly included 23 hours, aggression is increasing, even beating is said to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the Legal Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to young people's disabilities, 19 should be disposed of in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's happening in Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this and we can do it".
What comes to Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as previously built (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but especially with affordable rentals: 60000 to 80000 social housing units fall out of the rental price, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing needs to be created annually, and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour and Vocational Research, it is assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can work in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticise Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, whether they find work in Germany is crucial to the integration of refugees.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration researcher Dietrich Thrännhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on the employment of asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the obligation to reside with asylum seekers to live in a place of residence.
In society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the view has been largely that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is not a sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, therefore, the construction of networks is the Königsweg for integration into the labour market.
Berlin's school administration has found that only a few fledgling parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the displaced parents, it is only once very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
To convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handcuffs in different languages.
If the need for educators is greatly increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge in welcome classes will be prepared for the lessons.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal country prohibits asylum seekers or interpreters of study - the only exception was Berlin so far, interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student willing refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Refugees with a residence allowance or toleration are no longer receiving benefits under the Asylum Applicant Performance Act when they start studying.
The latter basically do not get Bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of the bafögig persons.
For four years, covered refugees had to live in Germany in order to be entitled to Bafög, and from 1 January 2016, this span is reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap also needs to be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state-church right to a new state-religion-relationship.
It would also be important to set up an Islamic welfare association that takes professional care of the new arrivals.
The rights also include duties.
For example, Islam's representatives must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and give it some scope for monitoring.
This includes the willingness to take decisive action against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be introduced to Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "are immediately entitled to reside here, in Germany," he said in Bayrian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will continue to be a whole society's theme much more than it is today.
This will also require a change in the majority society, and the elimination of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Although Germany - as a result of European decisions - has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for a short period of time.
But it learnt very slowly, as the NSU series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants organisations and the interests of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-racism Convention Germany will have to become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously anticipated refugees, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity is concerned, we can do that," he said to the daily mirror.
However, additional money had to be channelled into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all beginners hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
Benefits provided could be paid later to the Federal States.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited performance catalogue provided for by the law on the performance of asylum seekers.
Otherwise, doctors in particular will be able to create language barriers.
Even so far, Berlin's health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are more ill informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, interpreting costs should be taken into account, it demands.
However, many refugees would already be helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
However, with some other forms of illness, German doctors came out of their training, Montgomery says.
"Paracite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize," and as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even have a view of relief.
The Syrians had an advanced education system, and even some refugees were doctors.
However, in order to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and, possibly, carry out further tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Children of refugees are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and death anxiety.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong fearlessness and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, an early treatment is necessary, stated Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services can apply for psychotherapy, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services most staff or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misconceptions, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leadership", the Circus Probst takes back the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group in the ban on fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to wash in the manege on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chef.
"Leadership" - under this motto stands the current manegenstellung.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It's important to us to get people away from their everyday shit and take them to a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old Junior Chef.
"Manegencocktail mit Weltstadt-Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometres tour can now experience this flair.
The programme of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with jokes and charms.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of silent films, it wants to record the Cuban duo looser.
Easiness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and jointness.
Balancing with one wheel on one ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakes fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little else and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family", emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Absence in the attitudes of circuses is only too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also says: "If our animals don't do well, we don't do well either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read by the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the manege either.
So the highest commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony stallion and a zebra stud, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walk and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there might be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are there with our whole heart".
The Circus Probst invites its ideas daily from September 17 to 20 at 5 and 8 p.m.
The program starts on Sunday at 11 and 4 p.m.
Thursday is Family Day, for the show at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal view is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained intact, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
Parliament's opening up was also discouraged by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous threats of death and that they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with noises.
Last month, they had bled him out and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the restructuring and saving efforts of the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and services business.
The expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in an explanation.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have a wide and in-depth portfolio of businesses supporting companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on providing previously unrivalled, integrated technology solutions for companies", explains the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the rejection of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-tech companies, is the latest in this area based on the belief that closely focused companies achieve better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history, his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain next summer.
The great shame with this current problem is that after a separate ankle injury, Wilshere had ended the last season and had recovered to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd shows 23 different diseases from Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, which have recorded most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, if you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuky and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and to treat the players who need a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capital against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, especially as regards the need for men to open up, now more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign for a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "wonderful mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends is halving the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-loving and successful, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently said, money can't really buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent embraces, moments when watching football in cozy armchairs and the longing from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone department explained to me, "my audience role for people who feel depressed and suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I get along with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the little moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective external status via the phone may help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the backdrop designed for the celebration of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG move past Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö in the Prince's Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his champion League debut as a PSG player who led the French champion, but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk in Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they not only aim for the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn’t a class game by Laurent Blanc’s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the goal. He was later played against his home town team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not achieve one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which on weekends could hold a 2:2 on his own place against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was cast out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing storm was called the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he explained why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, before he passed by Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmo, the Celtic hit in a play-off to reach this level, appeared on the field at Anpiff with nine national players and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But besides a shot by Nikola Djursdjic, who passed by Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up itself, with some miscarriages and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who took no less than five trials alone in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had rebooted him.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his co-players into play, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan thus scored its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last champion league game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
Skills games are not enough."
Hats off before Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through share sales
Glencore, based in Switzerland, which is affected by one-thousand commodity prices, collected $22.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its huge debt eradication plan.
Glencore, registered in London, stated in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling raw material prices, as China's economic downturn puts pressure on demand and has a devastating effect on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange on early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced the $22.5 billion share sale last week as part of the broader plans to redeem around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arriving in Weimar
On Tuesday noon 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis's first official visit to Washington, takes place on September 25th and responds to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner this evening after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to take constructive action in areas of disagreement," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of disputed questions, including Washington's concerns regarding alleged cyberspionage in China and its growing self-confident awareness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola stopped change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the Barcelona FC at that time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, twice Club World Champion, twice European champion, once World Champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca Xavi now told him that he was already before the EM 2008 before his departure from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wants to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't win anything," he says.
And the FC also registered Bavaria.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Romenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not come about.
And today the decisive man works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has signed Guardola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the royal triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said that she is not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives, namely in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen script of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then do it when occupying the film and not when occupying the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief and cried "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of the actor from The Martian got stronger.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony," Brown initially said.
The only black person, and she's a nut that's being beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People worked for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the film's directorial rights; Damon replied that her director "may end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded against disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teen Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national effects and forced legislators and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against color.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums quiet matter", (the albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter Movement have published a statement in response to the question of Fox-News Personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Isaac Caldero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the big prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle race.
During the season, two men, Caldero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task included climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britons finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard battled victory, still under the shock of winning the grand prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E. said about his pile of money.
So suddenly .. like I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britons, although he was the first to finish the race, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he's got any grudges on it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received lots of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I was to be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eight season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNERAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as Spoiler, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to ascend within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-Worde, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once again in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) opened 6 times in the 1/3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," Simon said.
It's hard to throw in the bullpen every game, and that's why I want to go into the game very concentrated.
The designed Tiger host Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's made a good swing on the bat," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (beat training), looked significantly better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bundle, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy left Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designed Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, the right-hand Drew Verhagen a two-run entrance.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, the wall created an RBI double against the tigers' cloister Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stood Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by a still unmoving Phil Hughes.
The tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran who had been removed from the injured list before the game after he had missed for more than one month due to a back pain.
"Of course, not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning".
After they received the Leadoff Batter in the first time, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers increased in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center Field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, didn't score any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliever Right-Hand A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned because of an injury to the litter shoulders.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list because of a shoulder dislocation, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to launch against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has missed since August 20 because of a tangle in his right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people in need are then to be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She calculated with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the government bureau responsible for first reception, 7500 people have arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
Wolfgang Ischinger, Head of the Munich Security Conference, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a possibility.
"I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He promoted "collective vision" to the European states.
Four years ago, one had been glad that the Kelch had missed a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict is crunching at our doorstep," he said in Germany's radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controlled on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister for the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leiter said on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany, too, did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there have already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany in this regard.
Concrete figures did not mention it and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU Member States have not yet been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Ministers of the Interior want to launch a new start on Tuesday (22 September) for the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee spirit in Germany, the Federal Government wants to give greater support to the countries in the initialisation and distribution of people.
The Federal Government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined those people who needed protection, they also got it.
But if you don't have a staying perspective, you can't stay in Germany either.
This view had been strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "excessive effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest that the border with Romania would also be closed with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent Schlepper from seeking out routes across Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto to the proposed new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, therefore, eyewitness reports indicate that thousands of other migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icespanzer of Saturn's Enceladus, a global ocean is waving.
This excludes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Thus, the moon is slightly swaying around the ringplanets on its path.
This dome movement is only small, but still too large for a permanently fixed celestial body, says a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of Enceladus.
In 2006, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of Saturnmond, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must renounce offensive actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association announced.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis is "probably four weeks of forced break".
"This hits us hard, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unified professional.
However, the sixties initially presented a defensive man as a training guest.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian "has the opportunity to prove its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain shock.
The Austrian national player is due to enter the race training already on Thursday.
Okotie had broken his head in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3).
But he remained without a severe blessing, contrary to his first fears.
No diet fruit - Mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often advised by them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta carotene.
Those who eat the fruit thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel colour alone does not explain how ripe the fruit is - so also green mangos can taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
But a mango also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It alleviates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
UPS's U.S. Package Service will provide up to 95000 assistance for the Christmas business in the US.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, announced UPS on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being sought.
As early as last year, UPS had increased its workforce by 95000 for the holiday season.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements for Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought the parcel services very critically.
First Föhnsturm, then striking cold front
The coming night breaks through the valleys of the Föhn Alps, as Meteoswiss announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and on the night to Thursday the hair dryer partly blows with storm strength through the hair dryers.
After the end of the day on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing strong rainfall, wind bows and a temperature reduction.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the side of the Alps, the foot breaks through the valleys during the night until Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the foothills with arches from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland also partly with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can sometimes advance to the adjacent central country, and on the mountains even hurricane arches of over 120 km/h are possible.
While stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees in the north on Wednesday, the humidity begins to stand up on the alpine slope.
This is where rain stops until Thursday night.
In total, south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, over 100 litres of rain per square metre have to be expected, which after the last few days has already fallen large amounts of rain.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn goes out of the air, followed by a cold front with strong, partly agitated rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind rises strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decline significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north at 15 to 20 degrees.In the south, on the other hand, it gets sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther-Platz
Almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin-Luther-Platz in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located right next to the Colosseum in the middle of ancient Rome.
The naming had been requested by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes could often live as a minority in secret only for centuries.
With the place becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for several months as a young Augustine monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he received the city as a scapegoat.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him by historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar painted Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bibel, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colours and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means equivalent to "fun" images.
On the contrary: adapted to each topic, this can quite work quite dark.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artist selection from the many themes of the "Book of All Books".
These were cycles dedicated to such topics as crossroads, plagues, commandments or fatherless.
So he suddenly fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who, based on painting, has dealt with the various Bible passages.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into current contexts today.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and one set of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewellery cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old simultaneously allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter-Orden.
"There was already the training with the pipe rod," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work on this in order to perhaps tolerate me again with the Lord's Father."
His second concern is to help art return to more importance in a fast-moving time: "The perception of image worlds is characterised by advertising today, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and joy to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the images, let them work, discover and sense the power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" to be a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not take full care to grasp the Bible, but he chose the important, also mysterious, topics.
"This was not an eye-to-eye collaboration," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text explains only." A picture-bibel was created.
For Hans Möhler from Luther's publishing house, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction of BMX train neared
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, earth bucket modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train it was already finished again.
Political and administrative failures caused confusion, especially among those who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So shifted hill, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be granted in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now inform the Children's and Youth's Committee.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It was then to begin work at the former indoor pool without a "further commemoration break".
DFB intensifys engagement for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga is a clear sign at weekends.
Football reacts to the situation in Germany and guarantees politics its help in dealing with the problems that arise.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"No one can say, in principle, that's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This needs to be of interest to everyone to get hold of this topic," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At an annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Prime Minister, Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor there."
"Then the theme will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
But the decisive course must be political.
The German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach at the end of the UEFA session in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal ligands also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional associations will set a clear sign when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey rather than the usual sponsorship logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "image" newspaper (dienstag) and called the project "self-evidence".
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one can look away."
"We football federalists can, no, we need to use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
The national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the EM Qualifications Game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach called the support of refugees "a great joint work of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations in their places started their own projects would be great.
It's just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have spent, is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the Association together with the DFB Election and the Federal Government will each provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015, too," Niersbach reported.
Reports: Managing Director of SAP loses an eye in case of accident
According to Bill McDermott, the head of the Executive Board of Europe's largest software group, several reports have lost the left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident at the stairs of his brother's house in the USA, he fell on a glass of water that he carried in his left hand after midnight, reports the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bled, was powerless, then dragged out on the street - he told us this way last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "full working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "South German Newspaper" (Donnerstagsutscheitge), he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can do something like this."
"It's important to get up again when you're down."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was disturbed by the wheel.
He therefore does not come into question during the night race in Singapore on weekends as much as reserve drivers for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus have finally broken down in the first European League group game.
The national player will also be missing the leader of the football league in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00h/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot resort to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga-Topspiel against Leverkusen, the BVB-Coach left open: "We expect a return from him to the training on Friday".
In view of the high stress of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his trunk on the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the gatekeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Chiefkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level", the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weeds are used in the future in all Europe-League games, however, Tuchel left them open.
With high probability he will also contest the second batch.
The scientific statement by co-player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the European League must be the goal, says midfielder Julian Weigl: "This is not so wrong with Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic cars: government wants pioneering role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be, according to the will of the Federal Government, in the transformation of the car of technological pioneers.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new age of mobility" on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Automesse IAA.
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide less congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasises, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid change to digital radio.
A test track is currently being developed on the 9 motorway in Bavaria to test new technology.
In order to "no additional liability risks will be imposed on the driver", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to make an international effort to raise the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government is also committed to amending the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes over the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
After a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, vehicles without drivers on public roads would be "expected to be long after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study at around 8.4 billion euros in 2025.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said the SPD transport policy Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars still look skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey of the Forsa Institute on behalf of Dekra on Wednesday, presented by the AA, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect that 31 percent will not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the USA.
However, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the journey on all roads.
On the motorway, 15 per cent of the traffic in current traffic could be seen, 45 per cent in storage.
Good every four would leave control to the car under no circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis-EM
After the present state of affairs, the Düsseldorfer only wants to take a stand in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was flying for a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the scoreboard in Yekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo also missed, and we became European champions."
"That's what we should be guided by," said the World Rankings Foundation.
The English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has committed a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit with a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
At the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger, the first diagnosis pointed to a fracture of the shin.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figurine cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
Highlights: Window dolls that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfit - and so that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the enfant terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleached, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the sidewalk on the foothills), which can be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation from 18 September onwards, it is a good thing that the fashion maker has changed his initially rejecting attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was against it, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Montreal in Canada and Paris station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful dresses," said Roger Diederen, director of the Kunsthalle.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man, who wrote fashion history without ever completing training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed complete work of art, for which much effort has been made: for example, a stylist has been engaged to refresh the dolls.
14 tons of material have taken the makers to Munich, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was another special delicacies: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi means Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultiers old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first cool, fashionable search.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his Teddy bras and dresses, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later taught himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told Munich.
Later, of course, I bought them.
For his first own fashion show he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener lace as fashion niche
In the past, it was about making meters on the long stickers.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were made in large quantities for customers who, for example, reprocessed them to blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener top fashion played a greater role, was then pushed by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional suits.
The so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past styles, is an increasing potential for orders.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us they already make half of all orders.
Fashionspitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spit and Embroidery Industry Association together with nine other companies.
Only they may bear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
Private stores and wholesale trade are almost no longer available.
Our products barely reach the customers in this way.
Today, the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian area and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So there are sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to point out through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been leading a quality seal which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Ausstelle der Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.
To counter the competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the businesses that need to think mainly economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small balls in some places.
The Plauener goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "I couldn't start anything before with traditional Plauener lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme Plauener Spit - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plausia and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
With this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauen peak.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not touch, but Disney still dares to film his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly", it is not about a refilming, but about a kind of continuation, which 20 years after the first film plays with the magical nanny.
It's about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Who plays poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already stuck: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists on opening up the economy more widely to the world
The economy needs to open up more widely to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the direction of the reform.
"China should work towards attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote new start-ups and to drive reforms will lead to new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth, says Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list for regulating market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of public enterprises (SOE), raising private capital, and overhauling the resident meld system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it confers a greater role on the market in the allocation of resources, guarantees a state-of-the-art business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on undertakings and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of third-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to carry out their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thus leading consumers to a significantly higher dose of neurotoxicity.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies will be passed on to pregnant and toddlers with full growth," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of nerve poison for large fish are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons".
However, large predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that on the basis of the remaining limit values, about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be available.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as a "trick", because smaller pelagic fish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched mainly in predatory fish via the food chain.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "very small amounts can cause, especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, on its homepage, states, with regard to the existing maximum levels, however, that a "health threat to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury reaches the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, German coal-fired power stations are sending out more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fishes, for example, in Elbe, Rhein and Danube was "permanent and widely exceeded", the "mirror" quoted from paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings against mercury in fish were among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
