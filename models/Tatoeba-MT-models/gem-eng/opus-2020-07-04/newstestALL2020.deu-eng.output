Fire in French chemical plant deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant in the north-French town of Rouen has been erased. This was announced by the Prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was broken out on Thursday at night. Nobody was injured during the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with about 200 fire extinguishers.
The Fire could be stopped
Anrains were called not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemistry plant on the shore of Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety regulations.
In the factory around 400 people work. In the past, the chemical plant already made headlines – for example, when a leak released the gas methanehiol in 2013 and the environment ran far after lazy eggs. In 2015 about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system after an operating accident.
Woman quits her job to seek 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days was missing from the bitch every track - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was angry," said Carole King of the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then when they returned to the hotel, Katie disappeared. They searched for the animal, but without success.
Donner had a dog panicked
In hopes that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. However, out of days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man reported himself and said that Katie was in his court. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was standing under a tree. "I only hugged her. I didn't want to let her go", King recalled, according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without trace
Friday September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Federal Armed Forces have lost many weapons and tens of thousands of gun ammunition, including three machine guns, most of which are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" scale.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again – many of them so far without trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This comes from a listing of the Federal Defence Ministry, classified as closure, which is reported by the German editorial network.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3474 gun ammunition have so far emerged. The remaining weapons and parts of the weapon are six MG3 machine guns of type G3, four G36 guns, six signal guns and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 MG3 guns are missing.
The amount of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "disturbing", said left Bundeswehr Martina Renner. This was all the more so since during the investigation little was found. The left-wing politician spoke of a "necessary balance". Renner criticised that the listing did not reveal whether there was also any evidence of the missing munitions that had been found in connection with the investigations against the Federal Armed Force Officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of the possession of this munition," Renner said.
Oil tankers "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas today on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker moved and left the port of Iran. Port Rashid was declared as a destination in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained initially in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that one wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
On 19 July, the "Stena Impero" had been imposed by Iranian Revolutionary Guards on Hormuz Sea Road under the pretext of violating security regulations. However, it was assumed that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar of Great Britain.
Hormuz's road is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil exports is shipped by the sea meadow. The tensions in the region have increased dramatically in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who went on the road 30 years ago in the peaceful revolution. In autumn 1989 brave citizens had brought the GDR regime to ruin, Merkel said during a festival of the Thuringian CDU faction to the upcoming day of the German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor remembered, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken away from the horrors," she said.
Musk strives delivery record to
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery tree, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered over 95000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter. In particular, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A type of brake in the large brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question why children are so fiercely resisting the tickle, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand causes laughter even before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the large brain, which is already causing laughter in the expectation of the tickle.
According to earlier research, rats react in the ultrasonic field when they are tickled by humans. This "Laughter" is conveyed by the part of the large brain, which is the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touching
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and contact by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out during the experiments at the rats that laughter, as well as the activity of the area in question, is being suppressed during a self-touching. This was also the case if living beings were cleaning themselves up. While the foreign touch and the tickle by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse had been made to laugh.
However, if the self touch and touch by others at the same time are also suppressed, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self touch and the touch of others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self touch activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. In doing so, they sometimes broke off this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed flight behaviour or terror stars. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the tickle is a behavioral reaction similar to that of rats and humans.
Disaster disposed of: Great fire in French chemical plant deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant in the north-French city of Rouen, which is particularly dangerous, has been erased. This was announced by the Prefecture of Normandy of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire had broken out at night on Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have left. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Nobody was injured during the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by her own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the suspension of the compulsory leave on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without agreement from the EU on 31 October should not accept Brussels’ demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement. However, as he wishes to achieve this, it is unclear.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who had worked for Britain's stay in the European Union, "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to reunite this country would have been to carry out the EU withdrawal". Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Warnings about Oslo and Utöya attacks are revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial is revealed on Saturday in Norway in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that had been taken by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. The opening includes Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first lit a car bomb in the government quarter of Oslo and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organisation of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. In total, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring any solution in the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could re-enter the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani’s peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran since mid-July in the streets of Hormus is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now travels for medical investigations to Dubai, among other things, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell. At noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice to have it over," he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The London Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had already been released on July 19 under the pretext of failing to comply with the rules of the Sea Law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They would have behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and raging situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working on bringing them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in Britain's Gibraltar: In early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran intended for Syria had been put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery was against EU sanctions against the Syrian war country.
Iran spoke of "Piratry" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Presumably, it was a trade to free the "Stena Impero", as London vehement refused.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world’s oil exports is shipped through the sea meadow. The tensions in the region have increased dramatically in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents of tankers and drones.
Following the tensions between Tehran and Washington, the nuclear dispute between both countries stands. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of seeking to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States withdrew from the international nuclear agreement alone, which would prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time put an end to its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on Tehran's leadership with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to enforce a more stringent agreement that has been extended in other areas. Iran is resisting the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the streets of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York, with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf to provide Iran with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign security forces for shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India, with its protectionist economic policy, is building a better future.
India would actually be predestined as a "war winner". In view of the fine imposed by America’s President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are forced to relocate. Financial managers of Asian companies who are considering moving their production from China to another country call India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. This certainly has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers India seems to be creating a more important role in the globally branched production chain.
But now India itself has become the focus of Trump. Distinguishing from the Haudegen in the White House as the "kingdom of customs", America removed the threshold country from the trade preferences for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The USA is imposing prohibitively high duties on India and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictions with India clearly represent a deadlock. Furthermore, America also considers the world’s largest democracy through the security-political spectacles. Delhi and Washington link the concern about China’s claims for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, an anointing of American criminal tariffs against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who just started a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to weigh in security.
The problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development, in the Socialist Republic of India has a severe position. Also under Modi. His reformer aims primarily at bureaucratic madness, which has suffocated all too long any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-national state. Companies now receive quick building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more gripping insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating firms with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics, India has turned a lot to the better in the first five modes. However, in trade policy this does not apply. The national conservative government even created new barriers to the protection of internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi is linked to the Nimbus of the energetic reformer who is economically radically renewing his country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what is pleasing to Western managers. However, in the heart of the "India First" lawyer never came from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for the global competition. Businesses who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among the main voters of Modis nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain about these short-sighted policies.
Supplement of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to former French President Jacques Chirac, a report will be published next week in Paris. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported to the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral was scheduled for Sunday in the Paris Invalidity, as media reported.
Carried to the Goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Athletics World Championship
The world’s tip was long in the finish when the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium was playing hot-heating scenes. In the first prelude of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to sway dangerously. He could barely keep himself on his feet in a healthy position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly caught him and dragged him to the final half-station round of the finish. However, the forces were still enough to stop the accompanying wristwatch after the finish. As if the scene had not been sufficiently curios.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists. He was afraid to leave, he did not want to talk at all about his heroic act. Finally, after all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow of suffering. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Championship. In normal circumstances he could not even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
This is what he did in the evening with repressiveness - and much more intensive than he would have thought. For this heroic act will remain in mind. Especially Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end it had nothing to do with it, because the busby came to the finish with much help was disqualified precisely because at the end of the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, it was 18:10.87 minutes, but he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already. However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions: Egyptians equip themselves for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. In the center of Cairo, a reinforced police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
In the past few days, the police had stepped up their roadside controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, there had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They had been protesting against the government of President Abdel Fatth al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian contractors and actor Mohammed Ali, who lived in exile in Spain, who put the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, have called for a "million-dollar march" in the country for today. Ali calls for a "popular revolution". Although the man is not a "good man for most young Egyptians, because he was a subcontractors for the army millions, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase by two observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) human rights organization spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were not confirmed at first. The government confirmed and did not comment on the figures either.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "observed willingly", "only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW announced, in appeal to lawyers, arresters. The accusations against the prisoners range, according to their lawyers, from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities interviewed and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW statements, also arbitrary passersby.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocked websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Retailers: Retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many parcels are lost. Around 20 million returns land on garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be exempted from the turnover tax on cash donations, the Ministry explained on a question of the Green-Bundestag faction, about which the radio media group’s newspapers reported on Friday, but traders could make the market value of unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or little revenue tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the Germans would return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - would then end up in the garbage. They would be donated to companies after the current legal situation, as the financial authorities would rate donations like sales to which they would charge sales tax.
President of the Green Group, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) asked that companies be able to evaluate non-trading products accordingly and donate to non-profit organisations free of charge. Companies should be able to rely on not being penalised for donations. This would not only apply to online trading, but also to other shops from fashion shop to construction market.
Banksy Art for Auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be auctioned in the near future.
For Branczik, Banksys' work underlines "the restoration of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the basic maintenance of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the Southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The image could change the owner for a million dollars.
Finally, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a hard exchange of views with the opposition on Wednesday at the first meeting of the House of Unterhaus after a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit that has already been postponed twice on 31 October, even without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in South-East England he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks down a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walking in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy is a "walking in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy that. We will quit (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past days and accused them of, among other things, "treasoning" of the people. Accusations that he could put the MPs at risk because they could become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Mr Cummings said that the only way to get some peace back was if MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that people were told that the UK had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the invited atmosphere, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should talk with respect," it said in an explanation. "And we should listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UNO intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called upon the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at its first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno General Debate in New York. "If this goes badly, one hopes for the best, but is prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have waged three wars, two of them being the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August India had deprived the Indian Kashmir region of its autonomy status and thus increased its tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President Al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It is shooting at the population with sharp munitions, more than 2000 prisoners gather in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting in Egypt has never been harmless. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything in its power to avoid a scenario like at the time of Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions onto the streets. And that’s a problem that also the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it is going against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third party lives in Egypt below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you are funding: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was already the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, including the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulty in providing themselves with a bottle of water.
Tüv tests in terminal: BER-Chef: No "showstoppers" anymore for capital airport
Two months have been checked to see if the complex system assembly works in conjunction with BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said it was still flawed in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stoper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is not likely to be too large any more. The construction completion indicator is now to be submitted to the Bauamt during the first quarter of 2020, and this was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of shortcomings in power cables are still to be addressed; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the take-up of the operation of the aircraft, intensive work must continue to be done to deal with the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable tracks are hanging. The airport manager expects this to be available until the end of the year.
Moreover, fire protection is not yet working satisfactorily at the transition to the station below the terminal. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that run down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree meadows as well as planning errors delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally, he should go into operation in 2011. Since the beginning of 2006 the costs have risen from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros expected to be opened next year.
Because passenger numbers have since risen significantly in Berlin, the people responsible are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, it should be in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the Chairman of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finanzchefin Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will be retiring next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has set the airport finances on solid feet.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs - Police arresting man
He needed money for drugs - and he blew up several ATMs in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and car park automats exploded in Chemnitz and the region. There has been a million damage!
After two detonations, the police grabbed a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation of the production of explosive explosions in actuality with a particularly serious case of the theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-year-olds".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now has a total of eight deeds.
The police spokesperson: "With the prey he apparently financed his drug dependence."The bomber had blown up parking machines on the Bürgerstraße between August 20th 2018 and May 31st 2019 alone four times.
The total damage caused is at least 60 000 euros!
The automatic bomber is now under investigation and police investigations are continuing against him.
It can be thought that he was also responsible for further automating in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group rethinks its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the prize campaign with low-cost flyers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker of Austrian Airlines against the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa Billigflieger Eurowings will thus be dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings-Personal. In the future, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed in Salzburg and Innsbruck as chartering machines for holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA crossroads and network planning, the speaker explained. Flight times will be aligned on connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, the Eurowings in Vienna would only be used as a "production company" for the Group sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be used with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number will not be delivered in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would increase to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair machines together with Crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the trade union criticised as a roundabout construction for the collective agreement.
On Friday, Head of Ryanair Michael O'Leary said that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, Andreas Otto said, "We remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".
Queen's Enemy Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is supposed to have stopped at the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to be able to announce our engagement. We are both very pleased to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married in fact," said the couple, which has been in collaboration since October 2018 according to the British media reports, in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the coming years this will be very helpful."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and have also been published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about date, place and everything else will be announced to the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the gathering of the number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar feast as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart weakness or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and ill people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to learn more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of these types in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland the Hochgebiggsklinik Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich participates.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not known enough, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the Universitary Center for Heart and Cardiovascular Disease.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were known, it was called from the clinic. Each year about 200 were added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. Data could also be useful in the research of other national diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the Universitary Heart and Cardiovascular Center. New insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
Klaus-Michael Kühne, Chairman of the Kühne Foundation (82), also stressed the firm's desire to use the data for researching other diseases. So far, the Foundation's clinic in Davos has been treating allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be established at the medical campus there and a Professorship for Bioinformatics was created. In order to justify its commitment, the logistics entrepreneur in Switzerland said that he had been operated on the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the clinic. In the inheritance encryption, the scientists were strictly aware of the protection of the anonymized data. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital in Zurich.
According to the UKE, the genetic material of a person can now be decoupled within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this are at 1300 euros. The first gene sequence in the world, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are to be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police free hundreds of maltreated boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to reports from residents, security forces searched the school in Kaduna, Northern Nigeria, and partially discovered the still underage victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and being "improved". In fact, the guardians of their teachers had been held under "the most deplorable and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children of nine years old, had been chained in a small space.
According to the Koran school, the data have been available for about ten years. Residents would have called attention to repeated irregularities in the establishment. Parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They would not have thought of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested by police.
In mostly Muslim northern Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, therefore, over the past ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria have freed nearly 400 students from terrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
On Thursday the children had been discovered in an Islamic school after a reference. The conditions there were "unhuman" and the officials took the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been kept at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed worn-out and injured students in a clearly bad state of health.
World football election: Other accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth honor and therefore record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football elections, other countries were accused of fifa. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious justification.
Much of the fifa's work has proved to be a move in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionaries. However, the Fifa World Football elections have not so far been suspicious of running out unclearly - if one considers that the voting rights of the national trainers and national team captains of the members' associations are often more likely to agree on sympathy than on objective assessment.
However, after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies now occur: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly identifiable voting overview.
The fifa apologizes in so far as "the signatures on the electoral forms were given in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association was repeatedly contacted to clarify the situation - without response.
Sudan's coach also surprised
There is also an appeal from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation is understandable in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese Association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugasic did not vote as it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was received in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Federation.
The accusations had also been made by Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: "Had not voted for the #TheBest2019 awards. All the details about my vote are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the announcement was made by the Association: Voice, but of course it was no intention. The completed electoral documents were "disputedly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was stated in a message from the Association. However, the second captain, Manuel Rosas, was chosen. "We accept responsibility for the administrative error", it was stated in the announcement. However, both Rosas and Mannschaftstrainer Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases now allow the fifa to be examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains undisputed winner of the World Football Choice - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine-Affair: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two senior Republicans were open to official investigation against US Presidents and Party Friends Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Republican Governor Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being found." He wants to know more about the whistleblowers before taking action. An impeachment procedure can lead to the president's resignation.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. They had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyi on a telephone call to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden observed "since years".
So far, the Republicans have held back criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, few have seen any inconveniences. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. In doing so, the moderate Governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump’s policy, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As a further senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right procedure and responsibility for the congress is now to investigate the matter and to get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of U.S. states, have formally not taken part in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans expressed themselves critically about the situation. Mid Romney, for example, representing the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". In addition, US media reported that among the Republicans there were internal first cracks.
The affair could lead to an inaugural procedure against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of misuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the parliamentary procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make an impeachment. However, the decision on an effective parliamentary assembly was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for the success of such a procedure are small. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily. They should have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after having accidentally controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new serious accusations against racquets will be loud. Thus, three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects were taken in a recording camp in Messina (Sicilian) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we have no information on this," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country were raped, tortured and even murdered. Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence," said the communication.
NGOs and relief organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that even the perpetrators are on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed".
Italy's ex-Minister for Justice Matteo Salvini called for an apology from Rackete, who is still being found in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given a strong boost to his electric car group with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla staff members published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In the current and coming quarter, six-digit numbers have to be produced. In particular, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: only a bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget, followed by the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided to make a transitional financing up to 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October, the United States will once again have no spending plans. On Thursday, the Senate has followed the House of Representatives and has decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal government. President Trump has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown rejected
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year ending Monday 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws assigning the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the budget framework of 1,3 bio. to 1,4 bio. $ for the first time.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but spending laws reflect the priorities of the democrats who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also made ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly more capable of majority.
In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for wall construction, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the Wall Building Plans and their financing, which is intended for other military buildings and projects. The battle for wall construction had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall construction the spirits separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of transitional funding beyond 21 November is also excluded.
Against the background of the continued inability of Congress to agree in time on the twelve spending laws, and the resulting danger of a shutdown gain ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. Draft p. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the previous year's level, prevent the travel activities of parliamentarians and keep their wages from running until the new annual spending plans are in place.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is intended to open up to women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many children without a father could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which was defended by Agnès Buzyn as "Chance" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the costs of artificial fertilization for all women should be borne by social insurance.
Infertility with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
On the other hand, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which would give widows access to the sperm of their dead man for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there were cases in the past where women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased man. The opponents of the advance in Paris argued, a child so witnessed then carried a "very serious fate".
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and opposition MPs had, on the other hand, expressed their support for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow was imposed on a "double grief" if her husband's wish remained unfulfilled due to the death of her husband.
The initiators of the amendment which has now failed consider it unfair that, in future, a widow may be infected with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with his own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the shingles continued to be prohibited.
In Germany artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is still often difficult.
Climate compensation: Calls for air fare for unis become louder
There is a lot of flying in the universities, so in the future the country wants to have a climate tax carried out there too. The rectors say they don't have any money for it, but now they're under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
The discussion of climate taxation on flights from universities and universities, which had been held before the summer break, has again come to a halt. After the Landesrektorenkonferenz skeptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral candidates from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are pleading for compensation for flights of service. This was the first step "intensively necessary", at the same time there must be a wide debate on the avoidance of flights, it is said in their opinion. The cabin decision originally planned in July is therefore still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia adopts North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB secret service, the prisoners were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. As early as ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. However, this time there were no injured persons, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore on the move in Russian territorial waters. There Russia’s coast travels according to its own data to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 squid confiscated
In the re-checks, 30,000 squid had been discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, the data was confiscated according to three fishermen and two motor boats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
According to complaints from local entrepreneurs, Russia’s fisheries authority had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, the media have already been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about the ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In the future only 18,000: USA lowers the asylum ceiling
The "largest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world shoots itself off against those seeking protection: As the Foreign Ministry confirms in Washington, the upper limit will be further reduced for the legal migration of refugees. In future, threatened believers and Iraqi asylum will receive.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the admission of new refugees once again. In 2020, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020 in the United States, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as stated by the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the economic year that has almost expired, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump’s government has drastically reduced the willingness of security seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, there have been far higher admission limits.
The planned ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was launched in 1980. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs nevertheless referred to the United States as the "most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language usage of the President of the United States.
A "responsive" approach to refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their homelands in order to help rebuild them, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets much support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major dispute is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close down. In order to be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a potentially threatening administrative procedure.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups in the future, according to representation from the Foreign Office: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as stated in the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
In particular, the United States wants people from this "North Triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras' migration agreements to curb immigration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An orang Utan weibchen has been transferred to a reception centre for human apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra" born in 1986 at the Rostock Zoo was awarded the rights of a "non-human person", which is why its release is mandatory. The animal was brought by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human monkey is not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, it is supposed to live in the open-air enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. 21 more orang Utans and 31 chimpanzees have already been accommodated there, among them "bubbles", formerly a pet by Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" must pass through another 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was pursued by animal protectors in 2014, has helped to transform the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational facility will be created to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Dani Arnold, the extreme mountain climber, has succeeded in a new Husarenritt at the almost 3000-metre-high Cinnamon in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550 metre north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. He thus undermined the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sports goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit increase despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (almost 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the company announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new "Nike Direct" marketing strategy, with which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers online.
Sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period by the end of August. Nike sales figures increased most strongly with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon benefited also in the People’s Republic from its approach to direct contact with consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Finance manager Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thus expanding its competitive advantage. Investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium Ban on Racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pros Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToracism. Pride of being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has played at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late on Thursday. He reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma supporters would never have to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly Italian fans scold racist insults against black players rival teams. "We can't have any racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify and throw the responsible people out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on weekend. The reason for the statement was racist songs at the first league party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence on last Sunday.
But also around the followers of Juventus Turin there had been last discussions. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 chancelling fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are not expected to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police reported. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in Juventus. The twelve are accused of heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence, among other things. The club had brought the investigation into play with a show last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are supposed to stick behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have extorted Juventus employees to get on cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - all vintages are considered with catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the sense of life of young people?
"The crabs come!" This call officially started on September 21st at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as was announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee Department for Public Relations.
Gaochun, who is the southern foothill of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". Gaochun's great natural environment offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already begun their crayfishing in the early 1990s. Over the course of time, the crab industry has developed into a prominent industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years Gaochun has been active in a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of the crab industry as well as in a technology-based crayfishing industry. And the city has been concerned about promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the incomes of farmers.
In recent years Gaochun has launched a reform for the "dividing of power, optimising administration and government services" and with care built up the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for credit provision", which aims to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the local advantages of connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a signpost for the settlement of intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health industries and organic farming companies in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national, all-area tourism zone and tourist sites of national importance. In this way, the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun countryside, the state of buildings for civil services and for the public service, the areas of "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" have been actively developed and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worthwhile to look forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran-US conflict: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
After his return from the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of a alleged bid by the United States to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States would have envisaged an end to all sanctions, explained Ruhani on its official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event this way: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and urged a meeting to take place. "And America says I'm lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The nature of the sanctions that should be terminated has stood up for debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions."
However, this advance was not acceptable, Ruhani criticised. In view of the sanctions in force and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is supposed to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump at the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake in the morning, nearly 200 aftershocks have occurred, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This has caused a growing concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday the Marmara region had shaken off Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolises. Now the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Octay.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, says Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built homes fall into – among other things, the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
For years, city planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open areas that were registered in the center as refuges have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of Gölcük’s stay in August had the Building Engineer’s Chamber of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquakeproof.
The epicenter of the Thursday quake was located in the Marmarameer in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres of depth, as the Afad Civil Protection Authority reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu informed on Twitter that the damage or damage had not been reported at first. TRT showed people who ran into panic from the houses. Students were taken out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students wept as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake could threaten strength from 7.1 to 7.4. However, when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags finished packed with all the necessities next to door doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is waving. When the next big quake comes, it is unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu pursued the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to these figures, two minarets of mosques fell into the districts of Avcillar and Sariyer.
Warning of Postquakes in Istanbul
In the social networks many users report panic. Buildings wackled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It was harder than Tuesday’s, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Klinik, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to the time of the quake, official indications are given at 13.59 o'clock (local time). Just a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 has shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also whose epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the Afad disaster relief agency announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will someday be discharged - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy reckons that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a major earthquake," said Ersoy to the transmitter. "Before or later, the great quake will come too."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake also caused great anxiety in Istanbul. In Albania there had also been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year had shook the earth.
Parliament: new ignition in Ukraine-affair
Two brilliant documents provide for new ignition in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible court settlement procedure, the U.S. Democrats are encouraged: The complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous informant and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president raises important points for investigations against the President. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "hexen hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - Flyers redirected
Because a passenger had been locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines had been rerouted. The toilet door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline reported that it was US media.
At an out-of-plan stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be freed from the narrow cabin. For about an hour she had been locked in it, U.S. media called on other passengers. On further flight to San Francisco, passengers had to change the machine.
In a video on the Internet that is supposed to come from flight 1554 according to US media, it is to be seen how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline apologized to all passengers. Open was first whether the woman received compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the entire Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success writer Ian McEwan (71) has written a book on Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced that it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now at once the most powerful man of Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is determined to stop himself from nothing and nobody.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiters in high positions have to face the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to: write." McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines Like Me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's story is first published by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into an immense monster," gradually being excluded by family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," said the Diogeneous publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian rail infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary are given whisper brakes to reduce the noise load caused by freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to EU authorities, this should make travelling more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure summit "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travel to 31st October cancelled
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has canceled all travel by 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency contract. Travel could not be "on account of insolvency grounds", the company announced on Thursday evening.
It also covered bookings of brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it stands for travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had joined the British parent company's farm and had submitted insolvency contracts on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
As of now, insurers want to transfer money to hotels
From this Friday, however, hotels abroad, which currently host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, should receive money from Zurich insurance. Payments to hotels are based on the condition that holidaymakers are no longer charged for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are immediately not asked for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise required," said Speaker Bernd Engelien.
The insurance was therefore responsive to reports by hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodation on-site. Thus, some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, the insolvent travel provider agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance speaker. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook-Pauschal holidaymakers were leaving Germany. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return travel from Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts of hotels by Zurich insurance only help travellers who are still on the move. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly on holiday only, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening the company announced that all travel by 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to such bookings that are already paid.
As it stands for travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was considered, it was said. Basically, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and submit their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Bomb Mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
Dressed with a blue splitter vest, British Prince Harry in Angola lit and destroyed a bomb mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in Dirico, he created the ignition circuit on Friday morning before ongoing TV cameras. At a safe distance the explosives exploded in the Savannah landscape without harm. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry then wanted to walk directly in the town of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same champion, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to return the path she went on at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African journey since Monday, which started in South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that there will be no third postponement of the Brexit negotiations with him. But what statements are eternally lasting in the polarizing British. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Great Britain hovers like a Damocles sword above the Blondschopf. His suspension of Parliament to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the date of departure was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks with the EU until 31 October. However, this had been categorically excluded.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure also seems not to pass on Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he suggested that in the event of a non-union by the end of October, he would support the extension of the negotiations:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best of all with a deal. I'm cautious that this works.
And the time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have time to prevent a withdrawal from the UK from the European Union without any agreement. However, the recent talks have not made any breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October is currently rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister fails to break the law, a further postponement of the date of resignation will take effect. However, the opposition does not believe the Prime Minister’s words. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injured persons in this context, the CDC announced. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", more than 900 of them have already been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe no similar increase in lung damage is yet known. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the US.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The contractor and actor living in Spain is calling for a "popular revolution". Today, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military who accuse critics of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass engagements with a million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities are alarmed at any rate. In the center of Cairo there has already been an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in the past days the police have reinforced their roadside controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20th, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahir Square.
Last weekend, there had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces responded accordingly. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) Human Rights Organization, almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW reported on appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocked websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. Since 2013, the General has ruled the country since 2013, after he had overthrown the democratically elected Islamic president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. Upon arriving at the port of Hamburg, he was greeted by, among other things, the skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg, who had brought the race yacht "Malizia" across the Atlantic Ocean.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has studied and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. For decades it is known that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often happens under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the flooding of the seas. Among other things, the expedition had been measured with a drone of Greenlandic glacier ice cream and fished with nets of microplastics, it was said.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are at heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the last decades".
Tears Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for pasta 430 Euros
430 Euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The invoice with 80 Euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"These cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman of Federagit, the Federation of Tour Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
Propt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. Also a drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump, after the turbulent revelations of the past days, could actually be confronted with an official withdrawal procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as quickly as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to stand. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who ultimately brought to the public the discussion of national security and the democracy of the USA with his complaint, is monstrous: The President misused the power of his office to instrumentalise the government of another country for an influence on the election by 2020. He used Ukraine’s dependence and wanted to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published caption of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the telephone statement of July 25 is just an episode of a much larger story, in which the center next to Trump stands above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view in May 2019, the story begins when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans report to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't mix up in a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation for which we have the right," he says. One can think it is inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal." Giuliani wants that investigations in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful for my clients and could be put out as helpful for my government".
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's counter-candidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics then said to construct an occasion for Russia's investigation into the USA. However, this accusation was never serious.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selensky in July. The version of Giuliani and the President reads: the former vice-president and currently promising candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine commissioner of the Obama government, urged the release of Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, in whose Supervisory Board his son Hunter Biden was working. Biden senior had forced Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt actions of his family.
In fact, the process was a bit different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian public prosecutor go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also accused of even deeply corrupt gestures, the US government was by far not the only Western partner who insisted on his release. Furthermore, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disturbances with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances in Instagram and Facebook. Thus, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website alleberrichten.de, users report that Facebook has not been charging again and again since about 15.30. Instagram also gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disorder, though not yet to the same extent.
Instagram and co. more often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and in July the services for several hours had failed. And as in previous cases users also this time, mainly on Twitter, to make their trouble air.
Polish Scientists Saved in the Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were on their way with a tugboat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed by the Chilean rescue helicopter for storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, about ten minutes ago we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hose boat".
Poland has operated on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: NOT charging your smartphone wirelessly
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via the Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have come to the market, support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - first of all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from early July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. For this reason, the significantly larger heat development is. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery is heated within three hours to 27 degrees. When charging wirelessly, even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging path, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is located slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the weight of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces its capacity, but also does not last for a long time. Thus, the life expectancy is lower. Researchers therefore recommend always charging the smartphone via cable. Since battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has finally increased the cost of battery exchange even once again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on an appropriate charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and troublesome plug fummelier. Since Qi (standing for inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, with the exception of Apple, there are few limitations. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal, thus setting a record, announced his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Posible". He once made international headlines: from him came a photo of mountain climbers who stood on Mount Everest in the spring viral.
The image of the mass attraction triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and highest peaks of the earth. In May eleven climbers died in the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the rise of the 14th eight-thousander: At present, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason, among other things, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wanted to talk to China to enable him to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a heavy elephant cow, a police officer announced on Friday. "We suspect that elephants were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a shelter near the famous and many tourists visited earlier rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were said to be the police spokesperson between 15 and 25 years of age. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This happens mostly when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. The death penalty is theoretically due to their killing.
United Kingdom oil tankers are leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas for more than two months after its arrest by Iran. This was announced by the shipping office Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had ordered the tankers flying under British flag on 19 July under the pretext that they had failed to comply with the rules of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critique
The responsible Economic Committee of the Unterhaus wants to examine fully the premises of travel giant Thomas Cook. It is intended to deal with the salary packages of the Management Board as well as the question of why the British government did not like to help the surviving company financially. "Our interest is to supervise the company as well as control by external auditors," said the Chairman of the Committee Rachel Reeves in London. "We obviously have to do it with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in intestinal cancer risk
The role of genes in the family increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as familial eating habits are therefore likely to weigh harder than has been assumed so far. This has consequences for calculations of the individual intestinal cancer risk, stress the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla staff in an e-mail published on Thursday (local time) by the "Electrek" industry blog. The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it was continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer, and Tesla must provide as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of the market with an increase of more than six percent. This is how the price has grown for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95’000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to come in the current and coming quarter. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Does the British Government want to deal with Brexit law?
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he is seeking to circumvent the law which was last adopted by Parliament against an irregular Brexit. On a relevant question, he simply said on Friday before journalists that his government will be in a state of law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponement of the date of resignation should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes the negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedure trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU withdrawal.
Johnson said he is seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran apparently drives up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contracting parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of willingness to take concrete action," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference at the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not comply with their promises, he was looking for "further steps" away from the agreements of the 2015 negotiated agreement.
Background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the commitment to Teheran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US alone stepped out of the agreement to force Iran to change its position in the Middle East policy considered aggressively. President Donald Trump’s government intends to negotiate a new agreement with tougher terms and is now relying on severe sanctions against Tehran. Iran reacted with a return to the uranium enrichment limit in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least prepared for use uranium in the centrifuges installed in early September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans would not be willing to carry their share of the deal, and that is why, with the cost and burden of pressured US sanctions, Iranians were left alone, suspected Rohani. However, there will still be further talks that hopefully brought about a solution.
Rohani continues to challenge Iran's development into attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the combined situation changed: Germany, France and Great Britain followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen had become aware of the attack, but what the United States considered to be a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," said Rohani on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must submit proof of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders would not have been able to do so in the discussions with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, Rohani asked the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet by other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of the universe. This was only possible once before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn on other solar systems.
What was initially just a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized after his explorer on 2I/Borisov and aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The widely used comet had been discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object to be seen when passing through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get closer insights into a foreign solar system before he disappears on never seeing again. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The present speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Administration Nasa in a communication.
According to the comet, the analyses are on their way on a so-called hyperbelbahn which takes him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar hover stars, which were first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, were named 2I/Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in the approach. Researchers will remain for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness by mid-December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes by October 2020".
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into view. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from Hawaii University, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar drift star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of comets of our solar system, and that points out that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in ours, complemented de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of just two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as is often the case, it is still difficult to estimate such punctuations. One of the next interstellar visitors may be able to intercept a planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" at a waiting position of 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it should either lurk on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Right before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it's time: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of the China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, approximately 45 million passengers are scheduled to be delivered each year at the new airport, and in 2025, it is expected to be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s recent prestige project is also called “seesters” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new underground transport system transports passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction process, the Chinese had been told several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the - and significantly smaller - capital airport in Germany since 2006 has so far been postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine had already landed after four years.
New aircraft is scheduled to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams. This flight is intended to be a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) for which the company is developing Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire for the 2030s, CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve this," said Agency Director Graham Turnock to the transmitter. "We speak of the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
To advance the project, the British space agency wants to work closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently taking about 20 hours. As the only aircraft for passenger transport had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to its establishment in 2003, and it took three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop an overshadowed plane together with the US space agency Nasa, the "X-Plane" as well as Virgin Galactic has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable armaments".
Bust in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine-affairs
In the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by the U.S. President Donald Trump wants to detect possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of U.S. ambassadors at the United Nations in New York. The data subject was almost "a spy" and in the past "a little different" than today.
This was considered an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. Several US media, however, spread audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted to the President’s statement.
On Tuesday, the U.S. House Democrats had announced preparations for an inaugural procedure against Trump. Their accusations were based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employee, who raises serious accusations against Trump and its government headquarters. On a large public pressure, the reports of the reporter had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistlebower wants to have received information from several government staff, according to which the U.S. President "uses the power of his office" in order to ensure that another country intervenes in its favour in the US election 2020.
At the end of July, a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues in office to investigate what might harm his political rival Joe Biden. In this connection, we are dealing with previous transactions of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his assassin from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 elections.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine telephone also of the cover: Leading government staff would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic language protocol was made. However, this was removed from an usual database after the conversation with lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a particularly protected system. To date, only a rough protocol has been published.
The whistleblower's identity is not publicly known.The New York Times reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called Whistleblower" has distributed information from a second hand that would have appeared to be inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have contributed information to the Whistleblower, however, he was indignant. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted troubled and complained, Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations in various committees for several months against Trump and its surroundings. In view of Ukraine's allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new force to launch a possible parliamentary procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked the ship sharply, threw a false picture of things before him and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted the ship and had demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy area, who were mostly working among democratic, but also among Republican presidents, made a statement on Friday, behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats, for a possible procedure for the suspension of office. Should the accusations be kept, the "scrupulous misuse of power" by Trump, said it.
For the further procedure, there is no precise timetable. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual official survey failed in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for the success of such a procedure are small. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Works Council: Job cuts are "sliding"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could go on at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the car builder’s company council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros will be saved already this year.
A key to this is the staff costs. The "future pact" negotiated between the companies and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be dismantled from the carbuilder if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer required. In addition, employment security is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business councils, jobs in production that are not actually at the disposition are "sliding" down a different path - that is, past the official course. Thus, freeing regular places would not often be replaced.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the re-establishment. Meanwhile, in many places, staff who increase the condensation of work are failing to increase the concern about the gradual bleeding out of the vehicles. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: "Adjusting the employment volume is done as socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardise production worldwide and centrally control new projects. This will also reduce costs and speed up decisions – the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production director Andreas Tostmann said at a conference of managers in Berlin: "In uncertain times, from Brexit to the imminent trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves in a crisis-proof way".
On this path, there are already successes: For example, in this year, production costs per vehicle would be reduced for the first time since 2013. Journalists told Tostmann that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Precise figures on production time does not call VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is around 7 days in the Gulf.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg headquarters is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-in-house the rule applies that 800,000 cars have to be built every year so that the plant is profitable satisfactorily. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems of converting to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust testing process.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, however, Wolfsburg is expected to roll a million cars from the band, which is intended to allow the integration of golf production in the parent plant - because the Zwickau plant is producing golf production through the conversion to the location for e-auto production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have been declining. Therefore, the expectations are now on the golf 8. Despite all efforts to build the e-mobility, it is supposed to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburgers for the time being.
Forced to Prostitution by Voodoo: Traffickers
Young Nigerian women have been strangled, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six alleged traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six alleged Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to probation and imprisonment on Friday in Bochum for up to eight years and three months. The defendants had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. To enforce their obedience, the exiled Nigerian women had still had to take a ritual oath before a voodoo priest in their homeland.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan locks in tug boats, but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany they were distributed on different brothels to handle the alleged lock costs of an average of 25,000 euros, which is why they were completely reduced.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted to the trial the intrusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels. "The work made the women physically and psychologically difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict announcement. "Some were rightly offended".
The judgments are based on trade and restrictions on foreign trade, trafficking in human beings, maintenance and heavy prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened Ufo's airline company with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on 14 October about the labour struggle measures in the LH group", said Ufo Vice President Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo for months now, as well as whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
According to a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court, UFO now sees itself strengthened. Lufthansa wanted to find that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely differently, I think it is unlikely," said Flor.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted a request to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the status of the UFO as a trade union checked. The company argues that the trade union has not used a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
Prior to this, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the Spartan trade union, during which many members of the board and the Advisory Council had resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended an initial vote on cabin staff strikes at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about their leadership.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far Saudi Arabia has not just been known as an international tourist magnet, but it should change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the Tourism Commission announced that it would like to increase the number of international and local visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is an historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to reach for tourists. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the archeservative kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the East of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the foal, national oil production broke down dramatically, the oil price shots increased. It is likely to take several weeks until the oil production of the kingdom reached its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for a wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) prepare for their wedding party. On Thursday (local time) the model posted several party photos in her Instagram Stories on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized the People magazine according to a bachelor's farewell in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful suits printed with bananas on Instagram, among other things, and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxing for the wedding." According to media reports, the promi-pair wants to marry churchmen next weekend.
The beavers gave themselves the yes-word at a New York office a year ago. A bigger feast had not been there at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two dead in an airplane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the western Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Meschin), the police informed. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Since Thursday evening, the authorities had been looking for the machine after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half the European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities are causes of the threat, reported the World Wildlife Union IUCN on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of them do not exist on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of the threat and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "risked", "highly endangered", "extinguished" and "extinguished in nature" to "extinguished". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide than endangered.
Eberese and Wild Rossastanie Threatened
In Germany, especially Ebereschen (Sorbus), one of the authors, David Allen, said, the German Press Agency. "Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway, or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common Rossastans. They have been considered "dangerous" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan minima moth next to a mushroom. Since the 1980s it spreads from south-eastern Europe across the continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Rosskastans (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Types of shrubs and moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists also created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than one-fifth of moose and moose and almost half of all shrubs are at risk, according to IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, to migratory species, agricultural practices and climate change. Soft animals like snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and were an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make protection of these species a priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 reported injured
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. According to the information, there were no deaths. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the quake in the day before, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had rocked the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolises.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Octay. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate.
One of the most severe quakes was one of the strength 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeastern Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of strength of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called upon the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin-Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will present the mid-term show of the next Super Bowl American football final. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It's not going to be bigger," Shakira wrote in a photo of herself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to be standing on the Super-Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020 it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - then she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the mid-term show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina". She could hardly expect to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand next to another artist on one of the biggest stages worldwide and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "kings" were on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the mid-term show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you’ve recently sunk in the audience, the spectacle in the USA attracted the least of the viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still on average almost one hundred million people.
In the run-up to the mid-term show of the last Super Bowl, there had been riots in the run-up: in the struggle for dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick, media reports said that there were no top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B. Finally, the Maroon 5 pop group led the half-time show - the reviews were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, was on his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the most afro-American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been inseparably united since March 2017 and has not contested an NFL party anymore. Proves that the clubs do not want to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleise: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to pay dearly to the travel provider Thomas Cook’s expense according to a press report. There are high write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total depreciation of up to 1.8 billion pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to buy amortization of between 900 million and 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciated should be more likely to be at the top end of the bandwidths, an expert told the sheet.
The extent to which the losses of creditors will end will show up after the insolvency proceedings. One person close to this procedure did not spray too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s 40 aircraft in the UK were “old” and many of the properties were in poor places. Most money could be recovered with the sale of the airport slots and Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Racket is said to have brought alleged murderers to Italy.
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't even have any secure information," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torture and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organisations could not verify who they had sent on their ships. "They come without passports".
On 29 June, Carola Rackete had taken illegal migrants to Lampedusa Port, attacking a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects should have arrived there too. The captain is running investigations for aid to illegal immigration.
US warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network operator Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," said Pai to the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which obliges each company to follow instructions from the security bodies "under Chinese law".
The law in force also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continued the FCC Head, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand from suppliers a "confidence declaration".
Berlin wants first to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" under appeal for its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology not only consists of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," continued the FCC CEO.
The Chinese group Huawei is proposing close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership conditions are opaque. The employee company, which is said to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai of the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. has come up with findings according to which government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the position of the US.
Chemiefabrik in Nordfrankreich burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a North French chemical factory. The fire is erased after hours - the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's scripts are closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the responsible prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not expose themselves to the smoke. There was no injury. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop harvesting for the first time.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There was still the risk that after the deletion smell spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmen were in use at the fire site.
A giant black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which manufactures additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are monitored in particular. In 1976 a devastating chemical accident had occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the broadcaster BFMTV that there had been no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning around 2:40 pm, the authorities reported. The cause was initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis located at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more in order to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest, the sooner the better," said Le Maire in presenting the French budget for the coming year on Thursday evening.
The economy in the euro area is weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions".
Mr Le Maire said, among other things, that they should act on those states that have budget room for more investment.
France did not have these spaces, added the Minister and referred to the high debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French government debt must be "stabilised" and "slowed" said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax simplifications of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is responding, among other things, to the protests of the Yellowwest movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Does he still try to trick?: Johnson leaves question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "Capitulation Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician deviates from this possibility.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he wishes to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the law which was last adopted by Parliament, which should prevent that from happening.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponement of the date of resignation should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes the negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law after the EU withdrawal. Johnson said that he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings explained that he felt the political discussions around Brexit as "walking in the park" and showed himself confident that the intended EU withdrawal would still come about: "We enjoy that, we will win, we will quit (note: Red: from the EU), don't worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now acts as chief strategist in the UK government headquarters Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Premier into a totally outspoken situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) goes deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her in 1998 from 1969 to Linda's death, was clearly proud and touched when he presented the video "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of which are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments", writes art critic Ekov Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the centre: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
Then he danced with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, telephoned in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but that, beyond the spotlight light on their farm in southern England or in Scotland, also led a very normal life. So, according to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had roasted from old potato boxes. And it wasn’t always tidy up with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision Click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift of always catching the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the image-cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all Anecdotic is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes have been like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly laid out Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with imports of Iranian petroleums since some companies had "regressed because of the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran in particular on this issue and on many other issues", said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran has secretly pursued an atomic program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs stated on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, corresponding to a 40 percent cut.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but it was the most important task to protect and serve US citizens, and the US immigration system is currently being overburdened.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as stated in the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
During the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected from all over the world and relocated to the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low value. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, who left the White House, was about 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted horrifiedly to the announced lowering of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The USA would thus continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the United States - legally and illegally - strictly. According to his own data, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the next financial year. These figures are separated from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Getting close to a tip"
US President Donald Trump has accused in the Whistleblower affair of spying. Whoever has given him any information about the insanity of his use of power, "is close to a tip," said Trump, according to a private event recorded on Thursday in New York. Several U.S. media report this in agreement.
Then, when he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial operations in the White House, Trump said, "That's what comes close to a tip." Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with this a bit differently than we do now."
Observers commented on a possible reference to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticised Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. Moreover, it was an attempt to prevent a congress investigation into a possible court proceedings against him, the presidents of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower accuses the President of misusing his office in order to interfere with another country in the U.S. election in 2020. In concrete terms, his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer, among other things, suggested that Trump initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misconduct.
It is still unclear who is both the Whistleblower himself and his informant. As reported in the New York Times, however, the Whistleblower is an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Retired refugee boat: drowning baby and toddlers in Aegean
Time and again, people try to get to Greece across the Aegean Sea. Regularly these often miss small boats. During the downfall of a tugboat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed at the end of a tugboat. Among the victims were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could thus be rescued from the floods by the occupation of a passing ferry.
The local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants broke up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of Chios Island. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency (UNHCR).
The Who Cancels Concert
A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who, because of an impregnability of lead singer Roger Daltrey, has come to an abrupt end. In the middle of the Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it still runs."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey could "not speak right now". Townsend promised the audience to come at his expense during a reparation concert, but a date is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said they should be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly cancelled: WeWork lets real estate markets tremble
WeWork is the largest office owner in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Owners must fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the WeWork office landlord threatens to disrupt the balance on the world’s largest real estate markets. A few days ago, Founder Adam Neumann resigned as head, postponed the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values like the private jet for the executives to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British Financial Times, among other things, reports that WeWork has stopped the completion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it in part small units of members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has burned up money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the renting of new large areas is supposed to have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management of the company is now to take the emergency brake and stop the renting of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded leases with up to 15 years of service obligations of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets, over the past 24 months nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork’s new contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas that were being put on the market at this time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office learning in the U.S. metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider”. Similarly, it looks in London where WeWork now operates several dozen offices in the best position.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main landlord, in a deka office house purchased last year by the savings bank fund provider for nearly 100 million euros in the centre of financial metropolis.
Many owners have remodeled their properties for WeWork’s requirements with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, real estate owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billions of revenues. Access to WeWork’s reserves, however scarce, have not, despite the long-term leases. Because the rental of the individual WeWork sites is usually done by subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only held in tight limits.
Russia once again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian coast guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a total of 262 wilders have been arrested who had fished illegally in the waters, according to the Russian national secret service FSB the agency Interfax announced on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coast of coast travels according to its own data on the protection of their marine biological resources patrols. In the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered. In addition, the data were confiscated according to three fishing boats and two motor boats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, in 2018, the Coast Guard established a total of more than 8,000 violations.
According to complaints from local entrepreneurs, the Russian fisheries authority had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily detained there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about the ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also the ships themselves do not reflect the hygiene and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the arrests in the previous week. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean later died of his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first caught a North Korean boat and then a second after it had opened the fire.
USA imposed entry ban against former President Castro
The United States imposed bans on entry by former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs explained this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he is responsible for a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As the leader of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also responsible for human rights violations there by supporting the president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the continuing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had banned entry among others against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela for months, a fierce struggle of power between the government and the opposition has raged. The United States imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knee and to help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The Caribbean Socialist Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the repression of government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go on the road for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning action and rallying in dozens of countries around the world. Due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests spread across Europe to North America, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale consultation in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators wanted to gather there in front of the White House in Washington.
How big the worldwide commitment to this Friday will be after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people have gone for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries, complemented it.
A good third of all the world’s demonstrators - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, a list of the movement is planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland, people want to go on the road for the climate.
At the age of 15 years, Thunberg had put himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to call on its country’s politicians for a stronger commitment to climate protection. From this, the Fridays-for-Future movement was created within a short time. The climate protests involve students and students in particular, but to an increasing extent also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming needs to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tournament with a high-sea race yacht, where she had recently participated in United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke insistently to the heads of state and government of the earth. In her home city of Stockholm, she had been awarded her commitment for more climate protection on Wednesday for the alternative Nobel Prize for the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia must no longer smoke on the balcony. This means a change in the protection of fire. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Department of Emergency in Moscow on Thursday, the agency Tass. The ban should come into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes anyway must therefore expect a penalty of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should trigger a fire, then the penalty is higher. The ban is said to be the same burning candles to the ministry. Also cooking meat dishes on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Beating Cybercriminals - Raiser Server Off
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal transactions in the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel, through which the internationally active criminals operated their actions.
This was announced by the General Prosecutor's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night with a large action. The darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the perpetrators, among other things, are supposed to have been the operators of the world’s second-largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had destroyed investigators in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the Cyber bunker, according to the General Prosecutor’s Office.
For the first time such a host had been removed in Germany, it was called. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
During the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 there have been searches in Germany and abroad. They have been the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again plans actions and rallyes in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in Nordrhein-Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale consultation in Montreal in Canada.
Climate Protests who are actually Thunbergs Hintermen?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. Even more astonishing is the fact that a 16-year-old girl is holding the people of power in front of the mirror of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or wise marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person can win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt like he was chosen to work for a more just world. At that time, he has also been able to win a crowd of young people for himself and convinces them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, just as Greta Thunberg recently made himself on his way to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow side in this? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has widely sold itself, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also old-fashioned followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disturbed by the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also too thick. This is also not unfounded, because the action came very well in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here the ghosts now separate themselves: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially at the court of the world? Is it still authentic if certain circles of individuals work together with stock exchange brokers during the World Rescue Action? No matter what position they ultimately have, a critical and reflected point of view is always important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question pious projects from certain trendsetters as well.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed through our solar system
An alien comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: an alien comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet crossed by another star at the moment our solar system. He was baptized after his explorer 2I/Borisov and is currently working astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The injured body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was spotted during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to take a closer look at an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that takes it out of our system.
Comet has been spotted before approach - and can be observed several months
But before it is that far, the astronomers can closely observe it. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in his approach, which means that he can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Administration Nasa. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the heavenly body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the float star is similar to us. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León’s colleague Javier Licandro.
However, observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently did a giant asteroid break past the earth and get dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely obnoxious": Rachel Johnson horrified about brother
At first, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, and now his sister in clear words scourges the Prime Minister's military language as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly building up - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House on this Wednesday, there was a massive outburst of the opposition, and in the meantime there are still other critics who have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the broadcaster Sky News, her brother used words such as surrender, as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal were "hanged, dragged, squared, bred and feathered". She considered this extremely disgusting. They did not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the EU Parliament for the Change UK Anti-Brexit Party in the elections.
Her brother Jo Cox was particularly impressed by the fact that she mentioned an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a Neonazi a few days before the 2016 referendum. Her memory could be best honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'", Johnson's sister now criticized. The perpetrator had apparently come from the far-right camp, which feels "strengthened by this kind of language". For all who mourned for her, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her was if you passionately and determined for what you believe - no matter what you think you are. But never would you have to "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen that was more likely in the attacks.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory Member. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it is an inextricable tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson’s language was also strongly criticised in the church. As the “times” reported, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that was “not worthy of this country”. In a joint statement they said, “In the past days, the language has not been acceptable both in debates and outside Parliament. We should talk with respect.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in its 100-year existence: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots, promising "a blast of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming final of the U.S. Football League NFL. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has incredible strength in the US," Shakira announced in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November onwards.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a Telenovela and singer. In 2001 she created her worldwide breakthrough with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wheeever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected with excitement in the United States. This year many also consider the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least through President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones took care of Furore. Usually, the NFL finals watch over 100 million television viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy in the run-up to the conflict over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up in protest against police violence against Blacks when playing the national anthems and had been harshly attacked, among other things, by US President Donald Trump. From his solidarity with Kaepernick some musicians had rejected a super-bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtube joins Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali remains for the first time but prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who had an influence on whether to flow blood again on the streets of Egypt have spent the last week both abroad. One of the two floated back at Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfath al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, who lost Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state in New York in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisis's approach to political Islam and no syllables about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of the state television. "The Egyptians are not allowed to lead to the Irish people."
The President of the other man, who is currently determining the events on the streets, is trying to lead to error in the wrong direction. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad where he withdrew the access of the security forces that would arrest him immediately when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. The 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-provoking voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and tearooms of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls up his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He goes directly to the head of state and in a quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president ploughs in luxury and makes magnificent new palaces build, it is said. The leadership of the army, on which Sisi is based his rule, advocates corruption and enrichment. Because he spent 15 years in his second profession as a contractor with exactly this gentleman's business, he seems to know quite precisely what he is talking about - that is at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the newly exploding click figures show.
After the first week since Sisis's grip after power had demonstrated thousands of opposition to his rule and nearly 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested for this Friday, Ali called for a "million march". That really so many people would venture on the streets was unlikely. However, there were isolated minor protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants were seeking Al-Sisi corruption and demanding its departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were not independent at first. From security circles it was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the town of Mansura in the Nile delta, where demonstrators last week broke banners with the portrait of the president in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed due to "maintenance work", most of the roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which in 2013 followers of the stoned Muslim brother Mursi were exiled until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent dissatisfied: Sisis's future party wanted to hold a large-scale notice for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the tahir square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us meet with police officers." But as a retractor this is not to be understood: "Ganz Egypt is the tahir square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you don’t need to blindly trust the vendor’s speed details. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of excitement.
Finally, the promised forward rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be reached, explains the Bayern consumer centre.
If the connection always seems much slower than the provider, there are various testing possibilities. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the suppliers are however carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," says the Bayern consumer centre on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days to produce the promised performance to the supplier. This is best done by the person concerned in writing via an initial letter.
If this does not do anything even after multiple requests, customers may cancel and may also demand compensation. However, in the absence of success, only the lawsuit will help.
First senior Republicans for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken out for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here, is determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblowers before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president - are taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump has watched Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far held back criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned several times against Trump’s policy, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: More Marvel-Film
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel would go separate paths in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avenger" universe. It was completely unclear how to proceed with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) according to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". Several US media are reporting in agreement. Therefore, the movie should already start in the USA.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I'm glad that Spidery's Way will continue in MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidery verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? It is said that Sony Marvel has made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of future Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
So do Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the big finale. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were added in a charming way Tribute. Attention, the following sections include Spoiler as the serial finale.
One in advance: Duke Meghan did not return in the finale for a farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects once again showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or as they greet him after his retired imprisonment.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just marched towards Altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a much-reaching remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw himself over a rock, the digested Harvey wants to know from the groom, just to notice: "Louis, you're not the Prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children were drowned during the slaughter of a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total, seven people died during the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At the moment, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the UNHCR, 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he would like to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to "informed Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help in dealing with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the European Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofers with EU Internal Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Many migrants from Turkey continue to arrive in Greece. On Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increase in the number of refugees and migrants who come illegally across Turkey to the Greek islands was the last to raise doubts about the functioning of the EU's Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. In return, the EU wanted to include a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every displaced Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only progressing on the Greek side due to the lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are almost 29 400 people, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with capacities for 650 people, 5200 migrants are currently accommodated.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, there have been so many people, the State Radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate changes are "safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. In particular, the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature leaps within a short time and led to heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photopots
The chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was manipulated for this reason the cups?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a recumbent cup in his hand on a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, has never been held in hand with the reusable coffee cup with metal straw straw. On the party’s website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published before and also spread to the media - and there was still a sharp (popp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chefin must answer for photo pans
The National Post ordered May to be manipulated and that the party produce Fake News to appear more credible on the topic of environmental protection. And that in the middle of a campaign for the Unterhaus election, in which it is also becoming increasingly difficult Trudeau because of an bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cups".
May showed herself shocked and teased on her blog, not knowing anything about this action. In order to underline this, she posted the original: you, in conversation with citizens, a cup in your hand. However, he, however, put it right, was from bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokesman of the party said it was only about bringing the party logo in the picture, and not doing anything. From the photo there is only one cut out on the website.
May writes, her grief is for the employee who has done this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself something from her team, "If they want to edit a picture again, then they couldn't do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of one-way plastique or because of flight trips - their pictures were not photo-shopping though. So the boss of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, reported ice on vacation with plastic spoons, like merkur.de*.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng had been secured an upgrade by Cathay Pacific by mail. But when she asked to check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - many of them dream of passengers. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-explained influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65.000 users. On May 30, she has flown back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline even though they had indicated an email in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly envisaged an upgrade. The letter wants the influencer to receive from an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they were following the station. In fact, the employee from whom the mail is said to have arrived should have refused the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not show up.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about $1,280) she had to buy a new flight to Taiwan.
In her case, the Influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the Influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Airline’s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices according to reports of cease-fire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday noon. Last time, a barrel (159 litres) of North Sea Brent cost US dollars - around 1.4 percent less than in the day. The price for a barrel of the American type West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The course slide trigger was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have approved a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels allied to Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had announced the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would dispel the political tension in the region.
Should an agreement actually come about, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
Oil prices continue to move down the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Finally, Bloomberg had reported on Inside that after the attack in mid-September, repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was moving faster than planned. Thus, the production volume again reached an amount of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Last but not least, there were press releases on Insider calling for rapid progress by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. Raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid an exchange plan and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship was further anchored, Reedereichef Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the United States announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archenemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the USA and Great Britain had caused oil prices to rise significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations Against Trump Become Extensive
In the affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, covert accusations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government staff would have tried intensively to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous informant. The spokesman of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, accused the White House explicitly of "discovery". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that it will soon come to a third summit of power-holders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the North Korean Foreign Minister’s adviser. He also criticised the US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea. However, he hopes for a "wise" and "mighty" Trump’s decision to bring it closer again.
On Monday, Trump had said he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he prepared for it. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have been held in Hanoi since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the talks, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: We need weapons manufacturers to help with mine clearance
With a blue splitter vest, the British Prince Harry in Angola symbolically lit and destroyed a explosive mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in Diico, he created the spark circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola until 2025 free of mine, he later demanded to continue TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who did not help to get out of the road to commit themselves to help".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British Pound Under Pressure
In the face of a rapid reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt's speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) will reduce its interest rate is based on sterling. On Friday, the UK currency made up up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars.
Triggers of sales were statements by the central bank Michael Saunders. This brought an interest rate reduction into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned away, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising since Saunders spoke as a champion of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by Brexit-Hickhack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will, if necessary, lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Merkelblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Tidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of the Athletics Association.
New details on the doping scandal in Russia come to light at the start of the Athletics World World Cup - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and only gradually. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Tidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were fake.
In December 2014, the Wada had been exposed to systematic fraud in Russian sport for three years. During this period, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee opened around 270 athletes from the country under neutral flag. In February 2018, 168 Russian sportsmen and athletes were at the start of the winter games. They were also allowed to attend the World Cups in the various sports types, and in the summer in Russia they even hosted the football World Cup with the host.
No positive findings
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada Bann, but requested access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the scope of the cover of doping cases at the state doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
But the chairman of the independent AIU of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data was manipulated from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" from Friday. "We have identified numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada has received from a Whistleblower and those that they received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup Not Affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization in Russia’s banner. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes are starting under neutral flags. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and are undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in space and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to block the Rusada again and in the worst case also the exclusion of the Olympic Games 2020 in Tokyo.
