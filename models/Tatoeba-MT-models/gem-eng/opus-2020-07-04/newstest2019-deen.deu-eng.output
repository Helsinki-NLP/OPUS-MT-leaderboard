"Beautiful Municher" 2018!
In the afternoon another surprise awaits our female candidates: they will not stand the romantic Candlelight shooting before MY SOLARIS alone, but at Male Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, cooking, seducing - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Municher" candidates deliver wind, gish and rain like real professionals at shooting with People photographer Tuan.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"That's a question that, of course, depends on the fact that you get into conversation once, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt it somehow as it was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the now-monthly debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the withdrawal of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, and also justified him because Grindel had not defended him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB CEO repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He doesn't want to put any pressure on him, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with your coach and I find it sad that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden cottage burned in Schrebergartsiedlung
At 14:13, Linz's professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly across the Schrebergarter settlement, there was danger in default.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the cabin in full fire at the time.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and firefighting cleared to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had at noon an infested battery to the store.
This could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the range of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has to be determined - as is the cause of the fire.
It may be considerable, however, because the owner had many collector's items in his garden cottage.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What only led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live, as she seems to want to rip the children off a family in Moscow.
This reports the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial section of the stream for this purpose.
Here you see "For luck kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees right in front of the actress, Lohan follows the parents and her children.
It accuses adults to engage in child trafficking.
She doesn't give any proof for all this on the clip.
"The whole world sees it right now," is Lohan in the video to hear how she follows the family further along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
Looks like she's turning around and lohan's missing a slap.
Under tears, the actress cares about how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe started in Japan in December 2014.
It should approach the Ryugu asteroid so much that it can extract material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet advanced into the devastated areas and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as head of the Tesla Supervisory Board
In the beginning was a tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk caused unrest on the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletro automaker.
The U.S. stock exchange supervision sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla chief withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain Chairman of the Board.
Parliamentary Assembly of the British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party assembly of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party's agenda is about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit-Hardliners, to the front of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is supposed to be called northern Macedonia in the future, and on this Sunday the population is voting for it - whether it's okay?
Protests against right-wing populist Bolsonaro in Brazil.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") - is called Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went on the streets in several cities to protest against the right populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore in the forefront of the polls.
His toughest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers Party.
Audi: "Delgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said development director Peter Mertens of the "Automobilwoche" industry magazine.
In December 2017, the detained and released Audi head Rupert Stadler had announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/drive combinations are expected to be tested," he said at that time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important stage in the process of the diesel crisis.
We completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder had made "grassy organizational changes" so that such scandals never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and would like to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities propose that the Audi head have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false value added after notification of the exhaust gas frauds.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Sales Director Bram Schot is head of the company as Commissioner of the Management Board.
Because of the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronn voice".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Shot is based on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel aims to re-election - Lahm is going to the DFB-Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to compete again for the office as DFB President, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup out and the Özil affair next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make her as good as I can," Grindel said as a guest on the early Sunday morning at the "Current Sport Studio" of the ZDF.
You have to try to re-election again and again, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the director of the association "wonderful" if he did not have "Lust to cooperate in the future project" after the award for the football EM 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who has been agitated by the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete term of three years.
The next vote will be taken at the Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm is expected to cooperate in the DFB-Presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that in this role he will also be consulted in the future and then, of course, cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently this office of the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic are exercising, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is a clear involvement in society and football without a migration background and says, "the topic is important, we need to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Decline correctly with half smart scales
I've been owning a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
Muscle and bone mass can also show it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausage.
Doesn't matter if I replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear starting sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new season with a clear victory for the basketball league.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-master won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing game.
Rokas Giedraitis was the dominant Berliner with 20 points top scorer.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 numerator) from Ludwigsburg showed an appealing performance before 9113 viewers in his mandatory play debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won 84:80 (39:37) with S.Oliver Würzburg in the compulsory play debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatskis.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points best thrower with the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's Playoff Halffinalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
Karim Jallow was the most successful shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball lion Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new player Will Cummings was superior to the Oldburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA-Star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to supply live supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow the sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were involved - among them also sharpshooters.
The Islam Association Ditib is critical because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhröpe and Horror
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert at the New York Central Park for more engagement in the fight against poverty and diseases.
"Engathers you wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival the night before about 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a terrible second when many spectators thought the sound of a crumbling metal barrier was shooting, getting scared and trying to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran apart.
Seven spectators had been easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin, however, reassured the people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizens Festival" concert were free on the Internet, as every year.
Anyone who wanted to get married had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - Buhruppe for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage for more equal rights of men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as judge at the Supreme Court and thus put many women in the head.
At least three women have raised abuse crimes to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who reject them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the accusations after he confronted two women who, according to their own data, even had sexual abuses on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said at the concert in New York about the crowd.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the journalist's robbery
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the release of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first line.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
There was a disturbance in the outcome of the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a strong unrest, which could not be accepted.
Because of this, he'd have caused the person protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate matter or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gold Movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades of imprisonment.
Also foreign journalists are not sure in front of the Turkish authorities: Only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Finally, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken notice.
Although they were free and able to return to Germany, there are still processes in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drunk completely with Ina Müller
So fresh and good-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid happy discussions at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller bumps with her guests on some beer, some wine or even more high-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongue.
Not a few promis drink with courage for the obligatory vocals.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Männerherzen", "Terror - Her Judgment" or "Der geilste Tag".
The Munich trip to the high north did not get well at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely cracked on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: does NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round egg liqueur, which ina beats at half three, also let go.
Indeed, alcohol consumption is written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the relics.
They ranged from instant brows, fishbreads or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others were simply amusing themselves over the sight of the normally attractive cinematographer.
As Ina Müller survived the nightly harvest, so far it has not been known.
Since she has been moderating TV fun on the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and unhappiness
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway track in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and fill up.
Recipes against grassy vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Scissors, cigarette chickens, garbage and unraveling, demolitioned mullets and now disassembled signs - this is how the entrance with seat group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than infamous sight.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he also brought the subject to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but the layers are also destroyed: posts torn out of the earth, garbage dusters demolition, shields carved around, seat furniture embellished.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klipert.
But the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for storage.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also looking after the new wheeling site in Ziegenhain that is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this significantly increases the threshold to resort to common goods.
This would, however, require that a police strip pass soon.
In principle, Desert Hagen wishes for the development of the Haaße Hill.
He had to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far could be very satisfactory.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klipper appreciates the situation on Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning track on the Haaße hill.
In the case of traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and co-existence.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with twins of eyes in the sympathetic Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family with coffee and cake from the officials of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachtener in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrup star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwartties.
This contest, District Mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, was a novelty.
We haven't seen this in other parts of town yet.
What did the writers see connected to?
In the towns the Lake Hiltrup and the market alley were particularly frequent mention.
Rolf Himig chose the avenue in his slag-like song as "Kø von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing each other at these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about her work.
In this way, Humberg learned that he was actually studying chemistry, but now he is also teaching guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
For the jury's favorites there was something special anyway - so that others can also hear their songs.
A whole CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice appearance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children appeared once again to the finale - and even sounded "right well" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury of the aspects included originality, relation to Hiltrup, accessibility of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had created the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a full success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that are opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in which there are four cards with keywords that you - the old trick with the red foil - can only decipher when you put them in.
So it is guaranteed that the opposite side can read nothing by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4th party."
These are the terms that have been used to encrypt them.
For here should not be guessed the terms, but codes.
Altogether one player per team is the cipher.
He'll get a code card that might say "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto", guesses should not be the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "throws", "fest" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team is not possible; for that is what the party wins if it succeeds twice to crack the code.
So the encrypter notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to the feast; of course, there would also be something like "Party" possible and "Prag" because he has looked after in school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round for round, team for team.
You don't know the terms of the opposite side - but you can better match them with any hint the encrypter gives there.
So the descriptions should be mysterious, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The participants probably have to study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But those who have first started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this seemingly inconceivable game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as predecessors and genre-primus "codenames", which also supports an agent theme on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And to whom it's only about rates and not about winning points, he can easily find a version for two of them.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greetings and harasss guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection at Kulmbach on the night of Saturday on Sunday as double.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, later he also found himself in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he had not been able to drink clearly the space reference given by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the detention centre.
In a sober state, he must then also be criminally responsible for the use of labels of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schublocks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer hit buffers, they heard it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who records the history of the place and the train station.
No one made that up.
Since the brakes also quilted and banged the wagons.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that are pressurizing for Dinkel's home.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain range to the north, which after an increase of about 220 metres has its slope in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, draw-and-run blocks that had their home in Pressig were used in the past.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 lokschuppen, apprentice workshop, train and train mastery.
"Herzstück was the hub, which after a conversion in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railways.
The railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was under the supervision of Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branches of Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight electric locomotives were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the track in 1939 already minimized the need for draw-and-run blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10 000 weights were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken down, in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not considered a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous Bahnhofsfest in Pressig on the occasion of the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Soon it's over.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Pressig Rangierbahnhof was history.
"The Rangers and hemshoelegers did the most difficult work in the train," Dinkel recalls.
Any abuse would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images are here in the infectivePlus article.
Kerber with kickoff success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber defeated the Chinese Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World Ranking Thirds is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
The battle led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian placed at number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the context of the series "Art and Pleasure" a special exhibition was opened on weekends in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked the ideal weather, when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourist Association "Round around Walberla" in the series "Art and Pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor's speech showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Some surprising but announced Hahn's resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his job in tried and tested young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists and have helped shape flyers in the past.
Also this year, on the occasion of art & pleasure, there is again a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
There, too, this year's poster can be purchased "Betzn utzen", designed by Volker Hahn for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted by the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical embrace.
At the walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfully.
They are made of metal or ceramic, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, coloured, playfully decorated with 20 wind wheels, 24 hoofs and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object acts fairy-talely reconciled and invites you to stay.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to devote himself to the event 15 years of K&G in three dimensional letters.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
On half way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imaginations made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And also the Albachten made their impatience at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia" there should be no singing life in the district.
It has become a legend in the meantime: At a bank in the tin bush they lifted the MGV 68 Albachten out of the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It's gonna be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was supposed to be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the foundation's festival on their own for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was only a break.

In the meantime, movement was suggested: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound.
To the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost set: "Like a day, as beautiful as today".
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice, which many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hope".
Once again, Richard Homann's choir was sovereign, one of the five who was in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it's a master's achievement that he performs." By the way, not only men presented themselves singing this time.
The Women's Choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes above all Evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
After all, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own belt.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented soothing poetry.
There was a large tombola too.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre at the Allweather Zoo.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Acee
The riser marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in league three.
No trace of shy or freckled sauce, the independent make their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That was not clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately pledged: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a football.
"If they bring them to their destination, such a game can already tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the goal.
"All of us are aware of who is standing in such a derby on the other side.
That won't break our neck.
I've seen pretty good volleyball in stages," Annacker didn't hate the 0:3 and went to the agenda immediately.
Where the journey goes for the independents, it seems that after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one does he feel confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With regional league volleyball this is not nearly comparable. In the fourth league they do not want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not dirty in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we'll go to Emlichheim.
Aasee is due to arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the dream ship.
Now she talks openly about that the show might have had a co-indebtedness to her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of Chefhostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Träumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018, she went off board forever.
The series that made her a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans of Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveling alone with a suitcase around the world and many of my admired colleagues took me to the eye level," says Keller in conversation with the "Photo on Sunday".
At first, she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She thinks it's possible that her husband at that time might have been quite jealous, but "how many men did Hans also miss talks about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only one right and he wanted my fears, not to get to know my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I changed my mind", as she further explained.
She always had the feeling that "not to be good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, who I was never in truth, even though I appeared on stage sometimes naughty and brave.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes once again, "although I was afraid that it might be a second time too".
On the day before the total wedding, I sat crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller introduced himself to love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've gone way too naive to love."
This time, the nightfold who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the Zurich NZZ resort has ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our hide is not a moth, but a little lightly.
And the glaring shine, in which a green carpet is covered on the six-loud square, fades it over a fee.
But it's still film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he toress over the square to make it easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis" briefly.
The public toilet system sponsored by a large plumbing company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: The need for a new pavilion in the parter of a new pavilion is a lot of effort to find a luxurious ambience.
On this evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's oasis for any reason to heaven.
So get out here, get over to the other side of the street: invited guests who have just held the opening film "Green Book" next to the cinema, celebrate the festival beginning each year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all over the world, the works shown are known.
What do you not have to do with an article about this festival in order not to fall into sluggish advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The falter binds a bundle around the foals that have given him a good party, and two bully doorkeepers actually waved him in generously.
Inside, the invited ones push themselves, dance far to midnight to live music, or let themselves be dictated by DJ rhythms they shout at each other, and rinse down with cupli exquisite caps.
In the delicacies shop in the Souterrain, oysters are waiting for sparkling mints, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is sprayed.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studies the sign at the escalator: "Train a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If the two separate instructions were given, he would be in the dress code.
But it's more like a conditional structure, and it certainly saved life.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry chops a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", corresponding to the festival award.
This mixture, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been advertising the brand for years, isn't even here that night.
But since, between local prominence, cash tables and kitchenware, a face passes, which is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor should not be far there.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks, with almost sixty like a choir boy working through the crowd.
He is not appeased, not found, he seems to be stolen at most.
Especially for this reluctance, as a disguise, love international stars of this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and Ex-Footballstar Diego Maradona is delighted to win his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, fired by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican second-legist had defeated Leone's Negro with 2:0.
After the game Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to last-minute course "to the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league agent ASV, could hardly grasp it: "So a bitter defeat". His shooters were "damaged to the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - had not played well over wide phases, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we have completely slept", the ASV coach annoyed.
Quickly, the masters of the house with 8:1, even the early break-out that Bieletzki had taken, did not at first fruit.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
During the break, the residue was only two gates.
Especially Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, met in the phase for a different time.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David appeared Ernst to 15:15, then the season changer almost went through.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently soothing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Intercede the impartial action.
Bieletzki tends to avoid looking for fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four times - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, also stood against seven men well and repeatedly thrown to the empty gate.
Only they can buy themselves little for compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said the restlessly operated Bieletzki.
ASV-Torre: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pol (2).
Hungage (1).
Bavaria: woman missing for 30 years - Police digging for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the woman's mortal remains.
On Saturday, forces of operation are mining a road at Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the pavement and several layers were carried under it, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far away from the place where he lived at that time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not exclude a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working closely with the Public Prosecutor's Office on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority, the investigators met with a ground radar for an inconspicuousness under the road near Marx Green.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bordered the post to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening withdrawal as head of the billionaire company.
He and the U.S. Exchange Supervisory SEC have inadvertently contributed to a legal dispute over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk also leaves the Chair for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may, on the other hand, remain the head of the Executive Board.
In the comparison, which or must be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla allowed misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in front of the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also responsible for SpaceX's space company, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer who is now rated at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company off the stock market and pay 420 dollars per share that the financing was secured.
That would have made Tesla a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk rode back: Tesla stayed on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a chairman from outside, appoint two independent board members and also set up a committee that monitors Musk's communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel to be a chancellor until 2021
After the crossbreeds of the past weeks, GroKo collects several polls.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday throughout Germany for the first time.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases a counter to 17 percent, the SPD leaves a point and ends at 16 percent compared to the previous week.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
On Sunday, if the Bundestag elections were held, the government parties would receive only 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid CDU and CSU.
Thus, the large coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allebach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, the second strongest party in several surveys, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys, depending on the proportion of votes, have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards.
But also the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag elections.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens still find that Merkel is the right person in the law firm, as the Emnid survey showed on behalf of the BamS.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wishes the large coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, marked popularity losses for Merkel had been seen.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should be able to compete again for the CDU chair in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are 44 percent against them.
Thus, 64 percent of the Union's followers want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Extinction at Aldi: Price Reduced to Love Happiness
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of tinders there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about put meat.
Munich - In times of digital fast food dating through Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of acquaintances almost emits an anachronistic romance for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced Puten meat, boxersshort snacks at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere whip to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We dared the test: how do women react, not long in the first news talk about the hot brei?
Here's the amazing result.
The rule-right Hollywood Lovestory potential then has it when the happiness of love precedes an out-of-eye lost and recovered plot.
If the type is reported under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de in his worship, then this sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consortia - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch of us that it is quite desirable for her to find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic powder" meat.
She definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for her belief in the magic of analog learning.

Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.

Football: district league: researchers appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments during this still young season, Alois Fetsch went to court with his own hard.
He gave himself the coach of VfL Wolbeck’s football district ligist, who first withdrew (inside) to reflect on the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it is again running around the Brandhoveweg.
Tausfriser Belief is this 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only slashed by the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up every individual for the game to simply say "Thank you" for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went out of the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more playing shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17), Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
Almost this would have been a rumour when the SCA in minutes 41 struck twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously before the Wolbecker Kasten - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be master of his profession.
After the break the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed scarcely.
Schroer came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the conversion of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect shock for the sitters 18 meters before the guest house.
The madman himself took action and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flap hit the bottom left from the view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes, which should be damned long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penitentiary unhappily in the 80th minute.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
For fear minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory hit on the pussy in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
Thus, only 8 percent of the executives were female on the 1st of September, as stated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday, and the German press agency was in advance.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain and Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The backwardness makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the small increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is only due to positive impulses among companies in the index of medium sized (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past few years the proportion of women has stagnated.
Recently, 26 women worked in the board.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit once again consistent women in their own interest next year," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to undertake to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is given in the Supervisory Boards: On 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"In 2023, when the number of women recruited for the board of directors was as high as 40 percent per year," the report says.

With this question, "Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have been involved.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 Euros of operating profit with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only amounts to around 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley even in every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torture train to the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the club organizes the wine festivals, which since every Saturday in October will climb on Rehweiler Straße in the big fortress.

The president of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already magnificent feast. "This is something like this for 60 years - this is an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later struck symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"Good thing that so many have found their way back to us after Abtswind." Later, "The Troglaurs" made sense.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had fixed the drinks prices for the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A feast for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before it goes to the second round a day later in the feast.
In Bonn: Notarztauto power in Taxi
A car is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passant has been killed during the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn put an end to a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been killed in the collision of a car with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the nurse and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the notarzt auto had crossed a red traffic light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then encountered a crossing with the taxi that drove with green.
After the collision, the doctor’s car slid against a light pole and a tree.
He recorded the passantin, which still died at the site of the accident.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver badly injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from military forces.
The injured 29 - year - old nurse was able to free herself, but the walker could no longer help her.
Another called notary tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we tirelessly
After the blamable out in the league, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is likely to give more to speak.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the regenerated Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defensemen remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of an already over long distances of inadequate performance.
The mood at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is quite different at the moment.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's major competitor Pep Guardiola against Brighton & Hove Albion came to an approximately 2-0 win.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team for the first time broke the barrier of the outsider.
After a good hour and a double pass with the handsome goalkeeper, Sergio Aguero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for jumping to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As at the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hit remained the only match of the game until the end of the 25th minute.
Shaqiri, who came to the field at the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Better did it Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his slender.
After the Reds started with a flawless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was unable to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and the Remis in the league also dropped the Blues Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0-victory.
The fans of the Gunners, where granite Xhaka went through, had to accept a success message against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart had an unfortunate entry from Alex Iwobi into his own gate, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil, with his third season hit, made the decision.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now just behind the great rival Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave the riser Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeatable for the fifth time in a row at the 2:0 against Southampton in the league and finished the 8th place.
VW brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in turn with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the driving ban and retrofitting ring are not expected to let go of the German car companies at the Paris industry meeting.
From next week at the Automobile Salon, together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital, they will show their innovations.
The diesel doesn't really matter anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstadters is expected to be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
However, both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW is scheduled to start in 2021.
The new 3rd place is at the heart of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be present this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years in change with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were well over a million visitors.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens of people are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, huge damage to property has arisen.
After the quakes the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will still rise significantly.
The figures have so far only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities - along Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 Bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the psychological concerns of the PS-strong two-wheeler.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike god service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of a month at the house Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Some 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to engage in anything other than ordinary worship.
From 10 o'clock the Boliden were already lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
Initially, the biker’s breakfast cups were on the program and coffee and cakes or even a fragrant curry sausage could be strengthened.
Next to the MoGo team were the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was held during the biker's God service, Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical underpaint.
"Although the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetically calm," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle god service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a great feast: after the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his amazing spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and then Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and filled them with the apples in the great funnels.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine a tasteful drink from it.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in forms and wrapped around by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the a little like heckelselgut-looking apple pieces layer for layer above each other.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step of the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the Füchtorfer Farmer also had already finished stuffed specialties.
So he opened his "shadow chest" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of the apple press, but also discovered the built Hüpfburg for themselves.
Actives of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers were also engaged in during the festival and invited some stations to play for a limited period of play.
Also next year, the Homeland Association will offer an action day.
Then, however, so stressed Gregor Krützkamp, will not be the home house in the heart of the Spargel village the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the theme: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season course: "Basket situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, Trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 and encouraged them.
There was a lot of positive things to see earlier at the 1:4 (0:2) table last at Eintracht Frankfurt, however.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler, pushing for: "That's, of course, disappointing, because you always think a lot."
The further Sieglosen Niedersachsen, for which only Florent Mulija (86) came to a close, are at the bottom with two counters and are in their current constitution a descending candidate.
In contrast, Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory, led by the outstanding Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46.300 viewers, who, following the success of the general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by the Hessen during his debut debut and never to get the grip of Hanover's defense.
The storm that struck after the World Cup showed with its speed and perseverance why it is so valuable for unity.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, loaned by the Liverpool FC, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began fluently.
One of Lucas Torró's first threats to the gate net was a counterfeit headball.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term missing Kevin Wimmer (backs).
The leadership for the housekeepers fell almost compulsorily and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defensive corner into the penitentiary, Haller extended by head in front of the gate where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defensive player of AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller matched his Sturmpartner Rebic, who was able to refuel and 96-Torwart Michael Esser did not give him a chance.
In the mid-term, Hanover-Coach was responding to the weak vision of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a bit bolder in the front, but flammable ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the connection hit still succeeded.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only show runs for the Frankfurters against over-exploited guests, also Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix square becomes the party mile
Swirls Despite cool temperatures, good moods prevailed at the October festival in the city center.
The Mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, succeeded millions of people before the opening of the 185th.
Munich Wies'n in the last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or on Sunday thereafter.
The Festgottesdienst takes place in the town church, then a procession for the Holy Cross church with the closing seat.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the Christ who was shot out of the 30-year-old war and is supposed to have shot the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, of comfort and of life.
Despite the importance of the Geisinger parish, the worship was badly attended.
After the divine service, the procession took place for the Holy Cross Church and with the conclusion the church part of the Crusade ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish for the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members supplied the visitors with hearty dishes as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish also offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to facades, roofs, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual calls for tender would be prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing some years ago has increased, but more has been found, which has only been possible by means of a scaffolding.
The work on the base plaster is completed, before the winter it is planned to begin with the natural stone works and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid Danube-Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" will now be handed over to its destination - all the people who were present were agreed at the opening date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have already lived in the home of the life aid Danube-Iller for some time are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access to all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer's building was put to the test for the residents with mobile cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up to date in the equipment," Bader said looking backwards.
In 2016, the excavators pressed to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Danube-Iller opens new home
About 4.6 million euros invested in the new building.
The Free State went to EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450,000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained in the planned framework - time and financial.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Assistance, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagate between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience freedom to move even without any outside help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need help to be mobile".
In doing so, the housing and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this position is a real accident of luck because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers space of nearly 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three living groups.
Pride is Life Aid Manager Heinz on the eleven full-time workers all employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, Vice-Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all countrymen not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, "Tagesspiegel am Sunday".
The aim must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than people in West Germany, but 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after the German Unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngyang has made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean penguin hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their recipients already on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make the animals "usual" easier.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
At the third summit meeting this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced his friendship in Pjöngyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and join forces for the launch of the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of mutual approximation, Kim also agreed to close the Tolußg Ri test plant for rocket propulsion.
Austria's moving story in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the Republic's 100th anniversary, which has been celebrated almost ten months since this commemorative year, numerous new books have appeared that usually answer this question in the light of the past hundred years.
It is quite different for Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will appear on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for government
Back to technical work - this is the unofficial motto for today's working week of the Great Coalition.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not, last but not the "return to material work" mantra-likely protest.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other employed citizens in that country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but that's what it is.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself to its task again - to governing - it should not be allowed to hold them off with debate on terms.
If, after the provocations and blows in recent weeks, the Union and SPD can actually do something together, it may already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet in the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, issues of conflict with diesel retrofits and the professional immigration law are again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to leave the car companies with exchange premiums out of sight, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has been approaching over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD calls for a continuing perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "spurge change" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be fighting again among coalition partners - and how else should it be?
Not even though GroKo has joined forces, it has three partners with partly very different social imagery and priorities.
Struggle is good.
Without controversy, a society drawn up by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes may not be reassessed for party tactical reasons on the question of being or being absent.
It's still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD are to fight - but always have an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, the question of diesel as well as the change of track can be solved in a pragmatic manner - thus regaining confidence.
That is why the People's Party must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Fisheries
Does the Minister of Labour have any objection to the law in force?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" had worked her lawyers on the reform of social security, reported an exuberant social minister in presenting the same thing two weeks ago.
In the case of List-Pilz-Mandater Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is outrageous - it is now bringing the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes that "the minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and did not want to announce any breaches of applicable service law before running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "promote from any suspicion" Har dingers.
Police tearing up a street in search of women's bodies
Marx's Green - Lange didn't want to tell the police.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning is dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is still closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters in several applications.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year, the prosecutor's office and the criminal police department of Hof have been handling the missing cases.
In Marxgrün, a cycle path was repeatedly blocked and investigated with sonar devices because the investigators suspected that during the new construction of the state road, Heikes body could have been tightened 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: crabs in Barcelona before Catalonia Day of the Year
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia was the first time.
But already before it comes to scratches.
The separatists did not forget the use of police from autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of October 1, 2017, there have been clashes between the separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independent supporters, among other things, with color powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil units wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally, which last year was engaged in the illegal referendum in the polling stations.
At the time, when trying to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6,000 separatists would then have tried violently to break through the police chain, recruiting officials, among other things, with paintbags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested, 24 others had been easily injured, it was called to the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the referendum on independence was held.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split off the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections had been held in the region.
Following the inauguration of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new Regional President Quim Torra also consists of the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Infidelity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues to move.
At FC Gütersloh, too, only a 0:0 decision was made.
The final light and the third last one, they released 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as a pooled indiscretion.
The first half was extremely manageable from the entertainment factor.
Anyone who wanted to get a beer or a brat sausage could do this unconcerned.
There was no danger of missing a torchance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) torsion of the entire lot, Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had been given to the Ahleners, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Tower Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison line.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced as a result of injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel, 18 meters from the case, was almost over and after an hour the freighters appeared for the first time offensively.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented counter about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a but loose shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they rehearsed with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball of ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interimstrain Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mutzel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative did not come about by the Ahleners.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but neither did they bring anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to put out the positive: "I like that we played at zero". Unfortunately, the zero also stood at the front.
"This time we weren't as deadly as we were against wood-winded and that although our opponent didn't like to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensive "shit everything a bit like that" against a team, "that only wanted to defend.
I didn't feel like we could get a counter-gate," says Daut.
However, as a spectator, one did not feel like his team could shoot a goal.
For this, the idea was too bold.
Recckenfelder Harvesting market: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased to receive these donations from the counterfields.
The honorary officials assure: "These donations also remain in the field."
At the opening, the sky was shining blue, but the place was still a little empty, but that should change in the course of the day.
Because: "Here it's so nice, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests at the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper prize of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there's enough Kreimers.
And the "Replacement" could not be taken to entertain between musically the increasingly growing visitors.
It was so good that some folk songs were sung later in the hour.
"Simple great", Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually there shouldn't be anything like a board," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the booths and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a colorful finish - here goes what.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the corncracker off with the help of the fire brigade and took it to the winter quarter.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartful it was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative on his decorative saw.
Furnishings, beer lids with counter fields motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three reckenfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Bushschüter.
The latter also has a speciality.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
It is the company that allowed visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricating with local political message: No successful advertising for skate facilities
In Lengerich, unknown people have probably hardly promoted the construction of a skate system in any way.
In several places, there are lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal proceedings have been brought against the police for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" came out on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertisement sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the brief message of the day had apparently been left "only" with an Edding, it could have been removed easily.
"A few days later, however, this was again, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the appropriate advertising label must be replaced.
A special note is given precisely this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann, of the school, sport and culture department of the city, has already said that he has no name.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies standing on the embellished table.
For years, local policy and administration have been involved in the issue of skate facilities.
After the old ones had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative site began.
Finally, the Council spoke out in majority terms for the fire park.
However, it was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against building at this point.
At the end of June there was a turning point.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then has the City Council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Closer to air traffic control is even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic system in summer, the German air traffic controllers will see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, the German press agency in front of the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staff emergency in European air traffic controllers, for which there is no rapid solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for well-trained pilots was empty across Europe.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised that various air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the Federal Republic, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it won't go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German Federal Air Safety Authority.
Maas was once again responsible for the Lotsen-Misers by the European Commission.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings for national air traffic controllers are now fully linked to the operational business.
Maas appealed to the Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) in Brussels for regulations that "do not put the air down any further".
At present, EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and there would be a need for further tightening up.
The EU was subject to constant lobbying by airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they themselves have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delays will lead to a rethinking of airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Authority (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", Maas said.
So far, the announcement of 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years is sufficient to compensate for age-related outcomes.
The necessary staffing is not yet linked to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board approves corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board have voted unanimously for the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Head Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in administration.
After two withdrawals, the control board on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of employees are opposite.
However, the final decision is expected to reach a general meeting by 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include among other things the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG is intended to pool the business with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence among the demos of police and Catalan independence supporters.
In two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with numerous injured people.
According to the City Administration, around 3000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a great deal of effort to keep the two protests away from each other.
According to the task force, independence advocates tried repeatedly to break through the security lockdown.
They would've attacked the officers with paint and cast shot.
According to Ranleden, there were also indications between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and value of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to honour the colleagues who had done almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum prohibited by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officials deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of AFP's news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they dragged us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to mention his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British minister
A security vulnerability in a mobile app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and members of the conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the Panne became known one day before the Tory party day in Birmingham.

Football: Juve trainer praises for the top part: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star storm has "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought-in star was also without its own goal the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo was having a lot of fun and doing well," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three goal templates of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early setback due to the hits of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and depended on the worst chaser first.
The goal hunter brought by Real Madrid first set up the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo also made preparations for the hit by defensive chief Leonardo Bonucci (76), who only had to move in just before the goalline.
"There are many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri wants to see also goals of the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of record goalkeepers.
"We need to be even better in serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve Tournament is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to become even more intense.
Seven victories in seven games are the flawless series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the previous seven years already has six counters lead on Naples.
The former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, who trained on the table, was not a chanceless match against Turin.
But at the latest after the warning of Mario Rui (58) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb hard on Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel the same way.
==References====External links==
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was in use at all seven league parties.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo was away from the square at the 2:0 victory of the Turiner and is locked for home play on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
Rapper Kanye West has given attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on weekends with a particularly curly appearance.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided headrunzels and question marks for the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name for the release of his new album.
Fortan may only be called "Ye", according to the musician.
"The being that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince, when he left his artist name.
However, the pseudonym is not new.
Already the 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no heel out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more gripping, we have never put him in trouble as well as ever". Accordingly, thinly reads the list of Hotmar shooting options.
Grade two torcances in 90 minutes, so it is rarely possible to make games positive.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first one used Maik Krause from a pointed angle for the early lead (7.).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have increased uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause he understood freely.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when first Moritz Höne to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher failed and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the stationhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
A retail meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gateline and saw it red - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75.).
It was not until Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had strongly criticized ourselves before, which was then different today than in the last weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all." He probably meant the wingspans with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites that fell with collective offensive drive.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, swirled cheeky and moved from then on to his players, the relief was to notice that they had moved out of the affair with three points.
After a duel of two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class salary.
GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him with understandable mixed feelings.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after 0:2, how we keep up against one of the top teams of the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
The bitter effect is that you now have to go home empty-handedly.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side pattern valid for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski sensed the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own Elf managed to compensate: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through to the long gate (45.).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who made the compensation (59.).
Then it went over and over.
It was a crispy, action-charged game.
Nübel once again shocked Albachten (64), just five minutes later like Patrick Horstmann (69).
Despite overnumbering, Albersloh failed to counter the last Concordia (80s).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepdets, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonne (87. Bareksai).
Gate: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jylkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There has been no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to Dynamo Dresden, the entire Presidium of Football-Zeißligist has resigned from media reports.
Several media called in the evening in agreement for a joint letter from the Board of Saxony.
There was no confirmation of the association at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former federalists.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy of Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing will hold some 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Thus, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled his desire to pick up the tolerance prize personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, his term of office was too short: as President of the Federal Republic, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest.
This is how Akademiedirektor Udo Hahn calculated him when he said proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us". That the Academy at the Tutzing Castle has always been prominent, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker took part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann attended a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has pledged: he wants to receive personally the "tolerance prize" he received from the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" says a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "dangerous and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And at a conference on Syria: "Barbarai without limit".
Armaments deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks any human idea".
From structural racism in society to the shear between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Akademie-Director Hahn convinced himself: "Free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to seek solutions or at least to find partial solutions."
At a meeting to 200.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits a more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency "from left outside to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Both suitable for adults as well as for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner prefaced gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeling) woman and (feeling) man and what else may there be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used them and also mastered their violin.
Ben Süverkrupp sat on the wing.
One of the male sparring partners, who sometimes speak up until the end of the sentence, is a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, just as it fits the red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had brought a paradox to play: The satisfaction of man comes when he has a partner, but this doesn't open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is useless.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would have come from the composition of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
So, Sükrkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Lied From Death", and from Mozart's g-mill symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and Bravo from the full hall.
Flowers were presented by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the president Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also one in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident at the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the victim numbers down.
There had been a slight injury to 10 passengers instead of 15 passengers.
All of them have been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night to observe.
He'll be released during the day, said a police spokesman.
The cause of the telebus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the telebus was unbridled frontal against a guideboard.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG holds against TV Wattenscheid barely the white vest
The Ahleners had problems mainly with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"I was actually well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them," said ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The final concentration made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a retreat, lay at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) rear.
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hosts become decisively visible.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement backroom on the left-hand side, which then made "extreme clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the BSV Ostbevern volleyball women have established themselves again in the top group of the 3rd league West.
In the second round off VC Allbau Food, the Blue White won with 3:1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," Trainer Dominik Münch was looking forward to an almost flawless performance of his team with the dashed table guide.
The first passage almost dominated the guests according to their preferences.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-master of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has been accepted in two bars, but has not come into play.
We did a good job on her.
Our opponent has picked up at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "Essen changed the acceptance to three-way rails.
We couldn't hold the print.
Food has ranged, and we have let ourselves be fooled a little bit," Münch continued.
At 18:17, for the first time, the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their noses in front.
At 19:24, Oostbevern still defended four sets of balls, but the fifth attempt found its destination.
"The game was now a class better", the exercise manager was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and Wiebke Silke, in conclusion, made a significant contribution to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munch: "There we played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-White Passage brought four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also won an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Leah and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) criticised the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a cluster of sharps in the German-Turkish context, which can only be easily returned together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint, reconciled appearance.
"Sitt side by side with German top politicians to underline the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The broad exclusion of the German public has "encouraged many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break is finally folkreff time again.
On October 18th, at 7:30 p.m., the Nottuln Heimatverein is organising his fifth Nottulner Folkreff in the fireplace room of the Old Office.
Almost to the very day it is then a year ago that we have for the first time performed a folk meet.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meet was so fast in Nottuln eta.
Whether storm deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the official crew was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meet is like always a colorful mix of German folk songs, hikers and sailors' songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friendly musicians to nottuln.
For the first Folkreff "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbourhood of Steinfurt, who played music with records from German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish-people band.
The makers of the Folkreff remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz of Folkreff Emsdeten, with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht", enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a social and humorous evening once again," says the invitation of the home association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there in sufficient time.
The Folkreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7:00 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the proposed merger, informed Linde on Sunday.
Thus, the approvals in South Korea and - as the largest hurdle - in the United States are still available for the billion-dollar merger.
Last but not least, the opportunities for an insider's consent had improved because Linde has pledged to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October so that the merger succeeds.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall the 125-year-old existence of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landpflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last foundation impulse was set for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landspflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
In 1893, he was called "Kulmbach City and Country" as the "Circumstbauverein".
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, about flowers and gardening at that time nobody was thinking about.
"At that time, in the epoch of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatpfleider Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees should have long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens have been built in schools.
The cultivation of fruit is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7000 members.
But by far the spectrum is not exhausted.
Natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the conveying of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group "Maulwähe" showed how versatile the tasks of a gardening association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said County Chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important natural experiences are for life.
The chestnut collection was a big thing for us children, I doubt that with smartphone & co. you can gain a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, decide the County Association", added the Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of gardening associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the countryside also left no doubt about it by the district managers and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the County Association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come out of the garden, for the winter it was thawed in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it has already been there before us and we must be guided by it," the expert pleaded for fruit and walnut trees.
Therefore, for the horticultural associations, there is the incentive not to leave behind so that our home may remain beautiful and viable.
It also included welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian Land Association.
"We have to stop the glaring decline of insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, the successful festival, which was celebrated by the Thurnau Music Society's towering brass band.

Priority to Naphtha Talks: Canada's Minister for Foreign Affairs moves UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in the matter of Naphtha: They are setting up an ultimatum for an agreement between both trading partners.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the Trade Agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the pressure of time when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) was being re-appointed by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland during the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of Saturday, the minister will only speak on Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Naphta.
On Friday, Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had declared that Canada's negotiators and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The United States and Mexico had agreed on a recast of the Naphta Regional Free Trade Agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Naphta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been running for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time) they are to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would endeavour to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a trade fair attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report of the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked on open streets at the beginning of September during a campaign event in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people in several Brazilian cities went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations also made racist and disdainful statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, protests were mixed with a rally of the presidential candidates of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to compete.
The Presidential elections in Brazil are held on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad has been in polls far behind the right extreme candidate Bolsonaro.
Although Brazil's "Trump" has been involved in politics for a long time, it is recently presented as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a vote of no choice on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed - no matter who he enters.
Bolsonaro is known for his tempering homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He always shocks with verbal outings.

Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale before the gates of Paris.

After a long illness: Danish rock legends died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, informed his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children at the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt at Night" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement as "Straßenjungen", which was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The chief of government also recalled that the monarchy partner Larsen had performed on the 70th anniversary of Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a rewriting of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure from three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding – all in collaboration with the Booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde – are enthusiastic about the 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" Rock Night with their bands.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with front man and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the opening of the concert evening with the latest unknown pieces of his own pen and the next CD.
In front of the stage is danced to the band's vocal and printful interplay.
Although "supplement" call cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate their alternative, sometimes classical rock of the 1970s sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used for "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, really ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change of melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishuuschen has, however, gained a special popularity since its founding in 2005.
Full agility the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - has special stage experience is obvious and incomprehensible.
In interaction with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays their own accents with the only covert song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
To feel even higher controlled sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann provides a cheering solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to this kind of hard rock concert, of course: "Mint Mosquito" Rocknacht, according to the Mischpult team's information, is at the trio concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but is still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken Festival", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
Anaesthetic 120 decibels in nozzle power, as usual with the annual metal steel dike in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rocking gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say, in the sense of transfer, at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead person in sailing aircraft accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident has occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
On a parking lot at the airport Mülheim/Essen a sailplane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported in the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailplane had crashed at the fair park at the airport.
The pilot died.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student had been on board alone - the pilot is supposed to be a landowner.
The plane was already at the time of the crash during the landing.
The crash site is just a short distance from the airport.
However, an October festival has taken place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly at the exit to the 52 motorway.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at major events in the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump heaven to Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that, despite nuclear crisis, Kim's U.S. President North Korea's powerholder is perfectly well-conceived is not a secret.
But now Trump has made a genuine declaration of love to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president became known as a new flame.
Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean power Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of adherents in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-year-old spree of the ruler dynasty of Pjöngyang, although in the ring of North Korea's atomic disarmament proved quite tough.
"I was really hard, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters. They were great letters.
Her personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip confessions.
The fact that the affection for the "Rocket Man" (so Trump's nickname for Kim) who was notorious for his martial threat bearer might not be any memory seemed to be quite conscious of the US President.
In any event, he took the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall of the city Wheeling immediately ahead: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible is that?
This is so unpresidal.
But he did not take care of it very much, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger to the crowd: "I always told you it was so easy to be presidious".
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this packed arena, but we would only have been 200 people outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, atmospheric as well as above pampered by sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler's city centre has exhausted itself on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only at the Feuerwehrturm Festzelt, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees saved video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile video, have pointed to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya and thus made it possible to rescue them.
The group had turned its cell into a life-threatening cell in the coastal city of Sawyer in July and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally evacuated to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video he put himself in danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his associates had almost been beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the prison conditions had been catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and poles."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 Nigerian migrants had been sent back to their homeland this year with the help of the program, said the IOM speaker in West Africa, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad conditions in Libya.
He hasn't heard from a phone video call yet.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as unworthy.
The North African State, which is dominated by too many militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m. the teacher entered the building above the main entrance.
In the front of the 1st floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a path into the ground floor or the front.
The teacher contacted the police who took up the investigation.
Whether goods or money have been stolen can't be said yet.
Daughter's description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, somewhat darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please refer to the police inspection Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a woodland in mid-franken, after driving the car off all the forest roads and blocking a tree's car door.
Rescue forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance near a pasture and liberated the missing person since Tuesday night, the police announced on Sunday.
According to the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld, the data were in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man's stay had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
In talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Cologne's NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has referred to the rule of law in Turkey, according to his own statements.
Relations between the two countries were currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, above all, the wave of arrest, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to become normal in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important requirement.
Laschet also referred to German cases in prison in Turkey, according to his own statements.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved into a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense's readiness for flight at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at the castle Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib-Mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the USA: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not getting tired of highlighting the successes of the negotiations on the democratization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's presence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest setback is therefore that the US is building on forced measures that are deadly to the formation of trust," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will disarm ourselves first," the North Korean chief diplomat conducted.
That punishment could force North Korea to "knee" would be "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri highlighted.
However, from the US side there had been no "reactions like this", the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo insisted on strict compliance with sanctions in recent days with the United Nations.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to re-enter talks on the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme to Pjöngigang.
The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT got nothing with them: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the harvest thanks-godsdienst.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new cuisine.
The establishment was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
As Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers, the start with the new facility was not quite easy.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared on the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to make it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It's better not to cook either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Reverend Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was amazed with card tricks and other art pieces.
Jürgen Sator leaves the governor NRW of the Table
Out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Table, Jörg Sartor, has given his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as Vice President of the NRW Boards in July, Sartor said of the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The head of the Board of Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding of the decision of his long-standing alternate.
The sharp criticism took Sartor with him.
"I can understand his step - there people have expressed themselves who did not know exactly why the Essenes table does this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Table - "six days a week, nothing changes," Weilerswist said.
Sartor criticised colleagues of other tables in the "world on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city starve".
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essenes did not attend a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"It tells me too much sweet mushy," he said.
There are all these social fuzzes that have criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after retirement - Betterringen clears Lauchheim.
With 2:0 Lorch was in the home game against the TV Neuler already in the lead - in the end it stood 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Different TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim TVH quickly went 0:1 to the rear, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to win a 3:0.
Gladbach plays two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for a victory abroad in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke is the first season win against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five leagues with early counter-towers, Schalke has maneuvered to the edge.
Now the Domenico Tedesco team once again put on the strength with which it had taken first place behind the Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home outfit in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Jewgeni Konoplyanka per head, followed by the hosts conserving the mini-pulster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund greets new from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded against Bayer Leverkusen until the break a 0:2-back, but in the 2nd half it was still a 4:2 win.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a doubletette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86/94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also the VfB Stuttgart.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to fear against what was decimated before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the unobtrusive Goalie Ron-Robert goalkeepers fabricated a curious throw-in owner that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a successful but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The gladbachers who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a two-way tour out of hand, played 2:2 in the end, and have been waiting for a victory abroad in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation for the 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal ligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot from the Aargaur 20 meters, as was the second counter hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goaltender in the storm of the foals.
In response to Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from OGC Nice took place for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in a seventh mandatory game.
After seven rounds Gladbach finished fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeatable Werder Bremen managed against the VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first season hit, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serbe crested after a jersey against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back to the game through a curious throw owner (68.), a quarter hour before the end of Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters operating in excess back to the winning road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens was already taking the home team with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
Today, in Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens agree whether the name of their country should be changed in northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades of nuisance with the neighbor of Greece could be resolved.
Athens had been on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future West integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Acid in U-Haft.
A refugee attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beaten three pensioners and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had marched in Alsergrund on Friday at around 10:00.
When the police came in, they spoke to the accused, who went off with balled fists on passersby and tried to attack them, to attack his behavior.
As a result, the Syrians tried to beat and kick the officials.
Little later, it turned out that the suspect had recently hit down three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop on Währinger Straße.
He had also stepped the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises, and brain tremors.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured for "an unknown cause", as it was called by the police.
He was brought to the hospital and monitored throughout treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the password on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" newspaper.
"If we get married, then we're right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the Budgetary Spokesman of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim County, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused an outrage on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being "stolen" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski-moment," he pointed out in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters gate cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the civic association Kinderhaus and the Leprakunst Society.
For about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the Pfrundnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, president of the Civil Society.
And so it has gathered.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but fortunately it's only a form cut.
Because already in spring the hedge has been shaved.
The following breakfast always on the job has also a long tradition.
"It's supposed to be all in power," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner brings gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the World Canuslalom Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old set a perfect course on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympia-Bronze by three hundredths.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here on the plant and it has all fit today," said the London Olympia third in 2012.
In his goal he threw his paddle away for joy and drove both arms to the height of victory - knowing that it would reach at least for a medal.
After all, he had number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Second, the Czech was Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to break into a single-family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - they want to take advantage of burglars again.
The police inspection Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt at burglary this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained on the Königswieser Straße when trying to find the family house.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday shortly before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they took flight without spoil.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite near Hertha: collected from reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to be liked".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first phase for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small power plate under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Munichers to a greater depth of autumn.
"One week ago you had the impression that we are invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has caught us," Thomas Müller observed after the worthy 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that it's really annoying and that's why we're heading for Tuesday gas.
For the first time in more than a year no goal has been shot out, as at the same time in the preseason two mandatory games in series without victory, the table lead in the football league lost to Borussia Dortmund for the first time.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the end phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must nevertheless be warned.
The Augsburg FC at the 1:1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlesticks over the outside delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the last powerful Bavarias are to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we're going to do everything we can to ensure we're successful again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he went with his losers in his city of birth surprisingly gently and only pushed his first defeat as Munich Coach on the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first intermediate phase of his term a positive one, otherwise the tone would probably increase.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second royal class appearance of the season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-run match against Ajax, which had also sovereignly defeated AEK Athens with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, especially Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The lawyer played the role as a warner.
"I don't think this is all bad, we have to work it out again, too, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind us," said the 23-year-old shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were even behind Dortmund with five counters, which now took the lead again with one point.
And so Kimmich valued at least positively with an eye twinkling that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
"Yes, that's a good thing," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the union line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the permanent strike theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President severely criticized the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB-Chef defended the Verbandslinie.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil in the Mainzer ZDF-"Sportstudio", announced consequences from the Causa.
"There we have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-manns - that such a thing does not repeat itself," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan is not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
He had harshly denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and grown-up Mesut Özil and our Ilkay in Germany.
They have excluded them from this society because they were taking pictures with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
Frankly, as her president, I could not imagine that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed out to Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: When I win, I'm German when I lose, I'm Migrant - I can't do that.
"I regret very much that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return to the national team.
As a result, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer will be called.
"If there is a clear involvement in society and football without a migration background, and says, "The issue is important, we need to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office as DFB President in the coming year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make her as good as I can," Grindel said.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10 and 1 p.m. on Friday.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauter Höhe.
This informed the pensioner that he had been driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel since the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police filed a telephonic report about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a ledge.
The man didn't want the police on the spot, and then he drove away from it.
After that, the Red Valley drove home.
However, the pensioner has been operating in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and when turning around a construction vehicle.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a mischievous impression and couldn't think of much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 forces are still in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal defence site in Emsland, 980 workers are still working on the extinguishing work.
This was announced on Sunday by the Bundeswehr.
As the situation of a speaker continues to develop steadily, 70 volunteer helpers were last withdrawn.
Another reduction in the number of task forces is planned.
On the night of Sunday, an above ground fire had been discovered and erased.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed well a week earlier on September 21st, because it had been feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and radio flight.
On Thursday, it was said that an attack of fire on neighbouring communities would no longer threaten.
In time, more than 1500 local forces were trying to get the Great Fire under control.
The Luftwaffe supports the work on the Bundeswehrtestgeland near Meppen with a transport helicopter.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the password on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" newspaper.
If we get married, right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the Budgetary Spokesman of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim County, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused an outrage on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being "stolen" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski-moment," he pointed out in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Started referendum in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state began.
About 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the neighbouring of Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens has blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens agree with Yes, they will also launch their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with express consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors on this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of need by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - can only be removed with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donation card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card will be found at the decisive moment with potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You then have to decide, alternately in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Center for Health Information, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register where people can register their wishes - pro or versus organ donation - is not available," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has expressed support for a new regulation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would be considered organ donor unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is the world champion in head accounting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in head accounting.
He was in Wolfsburg at the weekend against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper told the science museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüss from Germany took third place.
The youngest member of the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, who was the oldest of the 74-year-old retired from France, as Chief Arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The IT professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981.822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants from the audience approached with pocket calculators.
Wenzel's greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball in the air when he's counting.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greetings were there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld at the time.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or wonderchild, organizer Laue can start little.
"Choping can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even data-based competitions at stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root pulling of six-digit numbers.
On a multifaceted basis, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have a good chance, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the best interest, because in early childhood headcounts are already being learned more intensively and with other effective methods.

Tennis-Ass Serena Williams is shown by her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer and become strong for early recognition.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.

The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project in which breast cancer early recognition can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were subsequently detected in Serena's lungs.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" in audit.
This will significantly increase the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the prohibition.
Polare cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds in the west next week for the first time: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Meteorology and Geodynamics Centre (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it can cut down to about 1,000 meters at a high intensity.
From the Bregenz forest to the Hohe Tauern, it is expected to be 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelhåde, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauer, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions therefore become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start with the annual kick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start with the annual knick care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the woody state for about 200 years.
The up to five-metre-wide tree and shrub hedges are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect as corridor scattered living spaces, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were constructed on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and cattle fences, they also supplied firewood and beams to the farmers for their factory houses.
His name "Knick" came from that time: "Cut" of the branches allowed the dense, intertwined boundaries to develop.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend and give the image of a wooded, diverse landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat by some 7000 species.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of Knick and breed up to 30 birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be performed if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he fades into a light row of trees, which in addition to the variety of species also reduces the wind protection effect," said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, hummingbird care may be carried out only outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on site
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the Tsunamis?
No, I was in Jakarta at the time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were over, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that aid can also be used.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service has fallen completely, the national government helps out.
Also a prison was destroyed, the prisoners run around partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provided on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who do not know whether they are living and where they are staying, because people were not at home during the earthquake, but were on work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran on the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI study in Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the hauchtune majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial for pleas of necessity.
President Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that have been going on for more than 30 years.
The most recent turn in the drama of Kavanaugh's appeal for a cultural campaign had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurist cast angry tyrates against the opposition Democrats, the Senate's Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the archeconservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the severe prudence on Thursday as "favourable", initially engaged in further attacks against the women and spoke on the contrary of "happy luck".
In this way, he said, last doubt could be resolved.
Later, in an election campaign, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump arranges FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One would investigate the well-known accusations of two women, no more, said one government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "They don't go on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are supposed to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" by the city community of Ried for monitoring the tempo limit is stationed on the garden road, according to the municipality from Monday October 1.
There is also the Bundesschulzentrum.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: one felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidelberg is a huge pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penitentiary," said Schalke's sports director 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the king's blues managed to bring the scarce 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11th of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco: "In total, the first half-life was good, both playful and pressing," apparently played a role with increasing playing time more and more of the head.
Don't create a baseball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore always retreated.
And defends against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who with his headball hit did not have an unimportant share of it: "I am actually the worst ball player in the man's making."
But in the end only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also with Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase with a lot of pressure and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, quiet and brave, so we have to play games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest flaw in the afternoon: King Blue missed it to worry about more clear conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a victory," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shalker with that.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I've made it my duty to get interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "reckenfelder Treffs" - that association that cooperates with the "culture policy" alliance in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, hands-on numbers and one or another joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-rich topics: migration and integration.
Despite successful integration, why are conflicts increasingly emerging?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits on a table, the first-generation migrants at the Katzentisch.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one is politically directed to the right or to the left, but rather, "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first, behave rather, then the discussion round is always going on.
And there's a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee tells from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or failed integration with students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the subsequent signing hour he has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, discussed intensively with prepared Kurdish specialties.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested people have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd building area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase is completed for the 20 properties offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
A total of 100 applications had been received, says Frick.
"At present, the documents are being examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the aim is to have the candidate rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with expected eight units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads will be paved in the near future.
A single property and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of it on the free market, 20 plots in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented housing supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Grob is estimated on the surface of the new Landsham-South residential area for about 200 people.

In this way, Schalkes Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bank
Not for the third time in the Startelf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting for the third time in a row not in Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered over FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle after the 1:0 win and thanked all his pros, the 36-year-old, all of whom call Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said, "Thank you, Coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his re-reservist nature, did not hold any grudge.
Naldo, who was celebrated as the best shalker in the past season, seems to know that he did not actually get to the finish track with his coach - but for good reason he gets a break.
There's a reason for it. It's a load control.
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you that honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the startelf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everybody can get through at the moment.
And that we're all on the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which also finally caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself also on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria's industry has accelerated in August its valley trip compared to the Eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was placed at a 37-month depth with 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best atmosphere in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday that it had surveyed among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, although the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th month in a row below the 50-digit mark, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
In conclusion, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, although the mood barometer fell slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But in the third quarter, in any case, the industry remains the growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not been as strong as since November 2011.
As a result, the companies completed the seventh month in a row.
Even in China, industrial production fell stronger than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices are raised, among other things.
