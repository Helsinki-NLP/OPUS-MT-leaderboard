Wise stewards are concerned about “looking like a fool ”
In some councillors, there is a suggestion to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Good Congress).
Concerns have arisen as a result of a plan to turn the council’s name into a prosperous assembly.
Counselors of all classes are concerned that this could make them laugh.
One worker - class steward said that his class was concerned that “it’s up to Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers living outside Wales: in the best of luck, twp means crazy and pwp means defilement.
Plaid Cymru, a counselor, said that the whole class was “dissatisfied ” and made other suggestions.
A good - for - nothing counselor said that his class had an “open mind” about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the words MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context, it can be said that the good letter w is presented in the same way as u in Icelandic.
The advice that now employs legal television to make the name changes said: “Of course, the final decision on all the appointments given to members of the council will lie with the members themselves. ”
The Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Board the power to change its name.
In June, the council published results of public polls that showed great support for calling the council a good assembly.
With regard to the title of the councillors, the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, ladies and gentlemen) was chosen, but MWP had the highest public support in the polls.
According to news reports, stewards now make other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement with the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who will present a bill of changes within a few weeks.
It will also include other changes to how the work is done, including rules on the disfellowshipping of managers and the organisation of the committee system.
Officials will be able to give a final vote on their titles when discussions about the bill begin.
Macedonians vote in elections for a change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the North Macedonia.
This matter was resolved in an effort to resolve decades of conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own district, called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its neighbours’ names in the north are equivalent to those in its territory and have repeatedly protested their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not view the elections as valid.
However, supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the change in the name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Church Clocks in Harlem
"The older people I've talked to said that before, there was a bar and a church on every street corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there is neither one to be found there."
He said it would be understandable to take a step downhill.
“ People have other ways to get together ” he said today.
"Children are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people meet regularly."
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will return to the field of origin. ”
He added that possible churches could be replaced by housing that are full of people who will not help to save the remaining extremities of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy dwellings in these buildings become white," he said, "and will therefore hurry for these churches to be permanently closed, because most of the people who move in these homes are unlikely to be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black - Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s church in the decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
A congregation of blacks who had worked nearby took over the building.
The congregation of blacks took over the St. Martin’s church under the guidance of Mr. John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to ignore merchants on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who sought to hire or raise the number of black workers.
The building was seriously damaged by fire in 1939, but members of the congregation of Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it and also made the clock game.
Father David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson, proudly called the clock game “the clock of the poor people. ”
The specialist who played the clock game in July called it another name: “Men’s Fund” and“ a unique historical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also stated that this was the first time in a world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved on to a larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not received anyone else in his place.
Over the past month, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the Episcopal Institute.
The Church Council, which oversees the visit and is appointed church leaders, wrote the Episcopal College in July and expressed its concern that the Episcopal College “would seek to bring the cost to ” the church council, even though it had not contributed to the recruitment of the architects and the projectors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop’s temple.
Shark hurts a 13 - year - old boy who dived for lobster in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was going down on a lobster dive in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling at help and then going over with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had at first held that it was only a thrill to have reached the mood, but then “he realized that the boy cried out,“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All his leg was rehearsed," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to come up from the water, "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
The Coast Guard officer, Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a more dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a serious injury to the upper body.
The authorities closed the beach access from the Ponto Beach beach at Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, in the study and safety sense.
Giles said that more than 135 different species of sharks were in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury with a plan to take action on the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, with cleanrooms in a shopping mall style and with specially trained assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter Britain's clean-up products, which is 2.8 billion pounds worth, and is growing as sales in fashion and household goods are decreasing. The larger washrooms will be tested in 11 shops all over the country and will be placed in more stores next year if possible.
Cleaning investments are part of the process of using a large - sized shelf lid that was previously new from televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury’s claims that it will double its choice of cosmetics up to 3000 types of products, including branded products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also be given increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The store also intends to re-sell its Boutique food selection so that the majority of the goods are road-friendly, but younger consumers increasingly demand it.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the vendor in two Sainsbury stores, saw the first opened in Croydon in South London last week and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet commerce and an increased tendency for consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in the neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets need more effort to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury’s, said that the stores would be more and more like shopping malls as the retail chain tries to fight against the supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced many Habitat stores since the two chains were bought two years ago, and has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt at remodeling their cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around the year 2000, which ended due to a dispute as to how to share the income of sales of drugs in the supermarkets.
The new policy comes from Sainsbury’s selling its 281 - to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds drugstores, over £125 million three years ago.
Based on the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these programs by adding a large selection of luxury product marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve completely influenced the appearance of our cleaners to improve the environment for customers.
Also, we have invested in special training for staff who will be within reach for advice.
Our brand choice is designed to meet all needs. Fascinating environment and convenient locations make us a exciting grocery store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "unspeakable" after Holly Willoughby canceled 11 million pounds of contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon Den, became a "harvesty" after the television show Holly Willoughby canceled 11 million pounds of contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Mark and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household goods and accessories, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, a brand name Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37 years of study in this Morning, reported his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star from Dragons’ Den, with painstakingness by quitting a popular lifestyle company in the last hour to focus on new and profitable deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones has been “undeserved” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his commercial power in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the TV lady popularly admitted that she did not have enough time for the homeware and ancillary brand Truly because of the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been compared to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was designed to double Willoughby’s assets, estimated to be 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced Instagram that she was going to withdraw from the Truly missile Jones from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
A source reported: “Truly was the first to get ahead of Holly.
This was to be her future project, which would earn her the next two decades.
Her decision to quit completely got everyone off the hook.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short in that the line was going to the market.
There's a full warehouse of goods at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, among Britain’s most popular stars, can cost the company millions because of large stock investments, ranging from pads and candles to household clothing and household goods, and possibly lead to further delay in the sale of the product line.
It could also mean the end of long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends of Jones and his wife, his wife, Töra Capp, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly and Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman of the Board in March.
Couples spend their summer vacations together, and Jones has a 40 - percent share in Baldwin, a company that produces TV.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the trade union M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm a Celebrity participant.
“ We don’t want to say anything about his business, ” said one reporter close to Jones last night.
Difficult Discussions “And Then We fell in Love ”
He rang with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate to the president, and for being so positive to the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, and he echoed a reporter’s voice.
"I haven't given anything left."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On the other hand, discussions about decommissioning nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June part-session in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, told international leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received an “appropriate response” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the United States continued to keep up with business demands in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was all the more positive in his meeting talk.
"We are very close to North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of individuals had lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship had resulted in a positive outcome of missile tests, hostages had been released, and the remains of the U.S. soldiers had been returned home.
He also defended his unusual approach to discuss his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Flooding and earthquake in Indonesia cause much damage to the island, hundreds have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international relief organization was told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that over 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee their homes, an emergency was not declared, which is the reason why an international organization could operate there.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so this is difficult," said Ms. Sumving.
Although the Save the Children Association is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain when foreign relief workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said that Indonesian officials were appreciating the situation in Pala to see if international organizations should help in the relief work.
In view of the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly badly prepared to defend its natural forces.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, which is a rare sight at other shorelines.
It seems that the avalanche of the Pala deluge has still increased the number of casualties, even though the warning has been issued.
Even in the best of situations, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
A medical vessel that has docked in Lombok to accommodate the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Pala, which will take at least three days to get to the new site.
President Joko Widodo made the main focus of his campaign of campaigning to revitalize Indonesian down - to - earth transportation, and he has put a lot of money in his way and railways.
However, a lack of funding has taken control of Mr. Joko, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative religious policies.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with swords, bows, arrows, and other basic weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, actor Liverpool, is equal to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the prime department by challenging 89 minutes at Saturday’s Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea when his team was below 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried shooting to the point of the pole.
The ball flew high over the target and toward its right corner.
The ball finally passed over the Kepa Arrizabala, which jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and touch once and didn't think so much about it, but just took the shot."
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
During the visit, the Chelsea visitor gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic with hissing and then sprang from the center to the game half-life Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball move quickly in the middle.
Then he sent the ball forward beautifully and sent Hazard in for a hell of a day.
Hazard ran out of defense and scored to the corner with a left foot shot past the target of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool opposes Napoli in the high - ranking department at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is at the UEFA European Videoton convention at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of dead rises to 832 after a flood wave in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832 according to an early Sunday report from the disaster agency of the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Institute, said at a press conference that a number of people had been buried when buildings fell in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale. The quake caused waves of flooding that reached up to 6 meters above ground.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from buildings that had collapsed.

A researcher named Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is well under way, but I would like to ask anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard something suspicious.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially the taxi driver, who might have reached something in a picture with his car cams to contact us, because they might have had important information for our investigation."
The police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside the apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The study continues, and police say they are working to inform the victim’s immediate situation.
A cab manager who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get back into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could come into the building or leave it.

Shortening the British Congress of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of "rewriting the story"
The ban on the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his superstitious Puritan followers on so many of England’s cultural and religious jewels.
However, the Cromwell Company said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "poor" and "trying to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about removing statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be outside the Westminster building before the battle.
The annihilation of the English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither the order nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed before the actions of his father Thomas in the preceding century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a target of the 19th century ideologies and is part of the history of a man that many believe is still unanswered.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to be the protector of the assembly against external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
Whether this description is correct is still a historical issue.
However, it is certain that the conflicts that occurred in the mid - 17th century have shaped our nation’s development and that Cromwell is a well - known person representing one side of their struggle.
It is worth to praise and remember his accomplishments as guardian of the kingdom."
Pigs attack a Chinese farmer and kill him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in the southwestern part of China, according to news from the site.
The man, named only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood near a chair on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou County, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai County, China.
According to the report, he had traveled with his cousin from the neighboring region of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead, and he saw that the door into the nearest piglet was open.
He said that inside the chair was big gold with a bloodstained mouth.
A trial confirmed that the 250 kg gilt had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded," said the uncle, with the last name "Wu", to Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or by his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that no one else was attacked while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
According to news reports, Yuan’s family and its market owners are in the process of benefiting from his death.
There are examples of pigs attacking people, although rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their home in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, 300 pounds [300 kg] of pig prone to tow machines until his wife fell off the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally nonaggressive, but that their blood habits can arouse aggressiveness.
“ They’re just playing.
They'd love to slip away and be curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them due respect," he said.
The remnant of the hurricane of Rosa brings great relief to the southwestern United States
As foretold, the strength of the hurricane reduces Rosu as it crosses the cooler seas at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern United States in the days to come, the city will have a great deal of resources.
Rosa became a category 1 hurricane with a wind power of 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. on Sunday to the east, and he was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific Ocean is being formed, and it will go east towards the west coast of the United States, and when it arrives at the Baja California coast on Monday as a tropical storm, it will follow a huge tropical storm northward into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of yield in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the lightning will be mixed with the lowlands that are approaching, forming a vast and wide expanse over the southwest part in the days ahead.
Locally, a 2.5 - to 10 - cm [2.5 - 10 cm] solution can cause dangerous sudden floods, soil movement, and possible creeps in the desert.
A large thermostat will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation in some locations, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of yield is expected in some locations in the southwest, especially in the Arizona Major.
There is a potential for rapid flooding with rapidly worsening conditions because of the distribution of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised not to go on foot into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
A great rain can turn the guilds into a gleaming river and thunderstorms that cause storms and storms of dust.
The nearest medicine will carry a local outlet in certain areas at the Southern California beach line.
There is a potential of more than one inch (1 cm) of precipitation, which could cause slight movement on the soil and the neck of the road.
This is the first outcome of the rainy season.
Some distributed tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before an outbreak spreads over a larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, a major outcome will spread over four volumes and last Wednesday.
Large changes in temperature in October are expected throughout the United States, depending on the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical world continues to be quite warm.
Sometimes this can cause severe heat waves over short distances.
On Sunday, a very good example of a high temperature reduction occurred in the mid - United States.
There is almost 7 degrees of heat between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The next few days, lasting summers will try to build up and disperse themselves again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern parts of the United States will get a warm start in October with a temperature of around 25 degrees or more from the plains of the south to the north-east.
A temperature could go up to 25 degrees [25 ° C.] in New York City on Tuesday, about 6 degrees [6 ° C.] higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecast suggests that the average temperature of the eastern part of the United States in the first part of October is very likely.
Over 20 million people watched over Brett Kavanaugh’s interviews
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a high court judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that was to take place in the 1990 ’ s, and the testimony was sent out on six different channels.
At the same time, the political stand continued, and TV stations suspended a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, Arizona Senator, announced a bill that the FBI could investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Committee on Judiciary that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to strip her off in a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional witness, said that he was sure that it had not happened.
Likely, more people were watching the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported on on Friday.
The company measured the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available for other TV channels that showed the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen, too, is usually in trouble to measure people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar to the size of the football or Oscar Award Festival.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the hearings that took place all day on Fox News Channel or 5.69 million.
ABC was second in number with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, there was still a lot of interest.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After this Congressman’s group of Republicans announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favor, CNN and CBS took pictures of it when Protestants called on him on Friday morning, when he tried to go into a elevator to get a meeting with the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while the shame rained over him in direct transmission at CNN.
One woman said: “I stand right here in front of you. ”
"Do you think he's telling the people the truth?"
People told him: “You have authority while so many women are powerless. ”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator door closed, he said that he would express himself more at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all sent directly later when the Justice Committee decided whether Kavanaugh should be sent to the Senate for election.
Flake said that he would only do that if the FBI investigated the accusations against the nominated people next week, but a minority of Democrats have encouraged this.
In part, Flake became convinced after a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, Senator Democrats.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and a few other senators thereafter.
The vote on Flake's replacement was clear that the Republicans did not have enough power to agree to Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized the FBI to investigate the accusations against Kavanaugh.
May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accuses critics of "being in a political game" for Brexit

The Wayde Sims shooting: Police arresting Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
One suspect has been arrested by police for the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting, who was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for another - grade murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published a video of the clashes between Sims and Simpson, saying that Sims has lost his glasses in the seizures.
The police found the glasses on the scene, claiming that they found a gene from Simpson on them, according to the CBS sister company WAFB.
The police say Simpson confessed to hearings that they shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a certain guarantee that the amount of $350,000 would be paid.
The Justice Department of East Baton Rouge County issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is gunshots to the head and to the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the Special Forces of the Louisiana Police Department, the Southern University Police Department, and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of the sports team at LSU, thanked law enforcement officials for “their zeal and their search for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
His father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average, accounting for 2.6 episodes each time during the last season.
On Friday morning, basketball coach Will Wade, LSU, said that the team was “harmful” and “in shock” because of Wayde’s death.
“ This is something you worry about all the time, ” said Wade.
Mountain of Fire spits ashes over the city of Mexico
Ashka from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the Central Center for Disaster Prevention (The National Center for Disaster Prevention) advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after increasing activity in the ridge and recorded 183 cases of gas and ashes over a 24-hour period.
The center watched with trembling and shaking from the volcano.
Pictures on the social media showed a thin layer of ashes on the buses in the neighborhood of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth physicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, from an earthquake of 7.1 at Richter over the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been in operation since 1994.
Police fighting Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of a voluntary bill
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants joined the riot police, and thousands took part in protests on the occasion of the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned an egg - laden police, throwing powder paint that formed a dark cloud on the streets, usually full of tourists.
Also, later that day, conflicts broke out, and police used batons to control attacks.
The separate groups cried out: “We do not forget and do not forgive” for a few hours while their opponents cried out: “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen needed attention because of minor injuries they suffered in the protests, according to local media.
Much tension continues in the independent territory one year after the national decree of October 1 was judged illegal by the Madrid authorities, but was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor, since most of those who were opposed to separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the elections in various parts of the area.
On Friday, a group of independents had stayed over the night to prevent protests in support of the country’s police.
The protests went on, but they were forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrician, participated in the seclusion protests with his wife and said that he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ In the past, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but close victory at regional elections in December last, the independent groups of Catalonia have struggled to maintain steam for a year, since many of their most well - known leaders are either exiled or detained for their role in organizing the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who protested to support the police on his phone, said that both federal politicians had encouraged the dispute.
"The tension is growing all the time," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned and waited for a hearing from the late last year, announced that he would invite himself to the European Parliament next year.
"My voice in the European elections is the best way to condemn the repatriation of democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested after driving home
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years of age, have been arrested after driving a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7: 30 p.m. on British time.
An investigator named Bob Blemmings said that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that the shot was made from a crossbow toward the vehicle.
Menger scores in 1-0 victory of Livingston against Rangers
The First Goal Dolly Menga Guaranteed the Victory of Livingstone
The low - league Livingston got Rangers off guard, and Steven Gerrard had to face his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the gift and the team Gary Holt's is now in second place with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet worked in the senior management of this season and is playing against the Hearts, which are eight points ahead in the top seat, the next Sunday.
For that game, Rangers will be welcoming Rapid Vienna to the European Parliament on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the division with six victories, and a principal coach named Holt has not yet had to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone’s Opportunity Against Unbitted Guests
Holt's team should have been over a long time before it cut the mark, but their bone-tenderness caused Rangers much trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow shot past after running through the defense to receive baldness from Graig Halkett across the finish line.
The hosts let Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that was how the goal was scored.
Rangers got extra competition, and Livingston worked to create a marketable opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who received a shipment and scored from the middle of the hell.
At that stage, Rangers had ruled over the ball, but domestic defense was inviolable, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper did not need much effort.
So this continued into the second half of the game, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, Ranger target, and Lithgow shot from the target after a visit from Livingston.
The barbers were constantly caught in the White House of Livingstone but were kicked off, and two requirements for hellfire - for the defense of Halkett against the reserve Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were dismissed.
Livingston’s "Simplified" Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A beautiful performance and a finale for Livingstone.
For a normal man, they stood up to their great standards and continued to live up to their expectations.
Their play styles and officers have hardly changed since they returned to the top of the league, but Holt deserves much praise for joining forces from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the chief of the team was extremely good and led a full - scale defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the toe all the time.
Rangers, on the other hand, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s rule, they played far under expectations.
They failed to complete their visits and managed only once to open a field hemisphere for locals, so this should be an awakening for Rangers now in the middle of a department.
Erdogan receives hybrid receptions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin, the sky was smiled and bright.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of Erdogan to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two nations.
There have been disagreements between them on issues such as human rights, media freedom and the entry of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish people outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters were able to see their president in her neighborhood.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard and condemned both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The opposite groups reflect the contention of this visitor, who is hailed as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator of others.
Deptford Conflict: A Wheeler Coped With a Car
A bicycle driver was killed in a car crash in London.
The battle took place near the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multiplicity of streets in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10.15 B.C.E.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics gave attention, but the man died in an accident.
The battle took place a few months after another biker left his life in a collision where a driver drove off to Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident.
The police said that she was working to identify the man and inform his immediate situation.
The road has been closed and the road has been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Wars Were Wounded
Six prisoners were injured when riots broke out in a men’s security prison, as reported by a prison agency.
In Worcestershire, at 9.30 a.m., the British local time on Sunday and still radiating, deserted in Long Lartin.
"Tornado" Special Forces have been called to the area to try to contain the eight prisoners involved in the riots and are only in one of the prisons.
The guards were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison official said: “Specially trained inmates have been called out to treat cases that are in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been treated for injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may expect to spend more time behind locks and locks."
Over 500 prisoners sit in Long Lartin, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the chief of prison had to go to a hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And last October, riot police were called to the site to deal with a serious disorder of peace, where workers were attacked with bullets.
Rosa’s hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dehydration may benefit from)
It is rare for a tropical climate to pass over Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remnant of Hurricane Rosa passes over the southwest, with the risk of sudden floods.
The country's weather office has already issued warnings about the rapid tides for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and west Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will travel straight across Phoenix on Tuesday and come late on Monday with relief.
The Phoenix Weather Office said on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes have reached the strength to be classified as tropical storms or lows at less than 200 miles [320 km] away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 64 km away from the Arizona border."
The last prediction from the hurricane center of the country’s predictions of a five - to - ten - inch [5 - 10 cm] outlet, with a small output of up to 15 cm [15 cm] in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
The results are likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other parts of the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with a potential for a unique output of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of sudden floods, the result from Rosa may be a blessing because there are a lot of droughts in the area.
Although the flood can cause severe damage, some of this result will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drying Authority, at least 40 percent of Arizona is very dry, but it's the second highest class," according to the news fromweather.com.
First, the hurricane of Rosa will reach the shore of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind speed of 136 km per hour and a total of 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, traveling north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over a cooler sea in the Pacific, so its power diminishes.
So it is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday evening.
In some areas of Mexico, there is a considerable potential for survival, with a significant risk of flooding.
"We're waiting for an exit up to 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest part of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm outcome," said the weather.com report.
Rose will then head north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, then reach Arizona’s borders early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low, then continue through Arizona and arrive at Utah’s southern part late on Tuesday evening.
“ Most of the risks expected from Rosa or its remains are very high in Baja California, the northwest part of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert area of the United States, ” said the country’s hurricane center.
These results are expected to cause life - threatening sudden flooding and movement on the soil in the desert, and to creep to the top of the mountain.
Midsomer Norton’s Attack: Four Arrests for Homicide
Three teenage boys and 20 - year - olds have been arrested for a murder attempt, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4 p.m. to British Saturday time.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be "steady".
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - old and one 20 - year - old, was arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police have been waiting for a witness who might have phone records of what happened to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh “felt evil and anger ” from the Democratic Party
'The motion to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote which rejects the ruthless and disgraceful methods of the Democratic Party,' said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “felt evil and anger ” from the Democratic Party out of all his appointments.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the assembly on Thursday, where he persistently denied the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had harassed her sexually for several decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the committee about his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “The United States had seen genius and manhood and courage ” Kavanaugh the other day.
"Confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of our most clever lawyers, a lawyer with a brilliant CV as a public employee," he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke of the importance of the supporters of the Republicans participating in the mid - period trials.
“ It’s five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't propose, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going around a lot to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were working “to restrain and hinder. ”
The first key issue on the floor of the Authority on the appointment of Kavanaugh should be submitted no later than Friday, according to the assistant of the leaders of the Republicans in the interview with CNN.
Hundreds died after earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and likely the number of dead will rise
At least 384 died, and many were washed away by a massive wave on the shores, when a great earthquake and flooding raged over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in Pala on Friday, when as many as six feet [6 m] of high tides were on the beach at sunset, multitudes of people washed out at sea and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The wave was formed after an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter.
"When the tsunami developed yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't escape immediately, so they died," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster organization, at a information meeting in Jakarta.
"The wave did not come alone, it carried cars, wooden trunks, houses, it hit everything that was on land," said Nugroho, adding that the wave had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km before it hit the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the tide and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Pala.
Air photocassettes published by the disaster agency showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and ruined bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to roam the coastal city on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was observed in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
In a declaration about food and technology, Indonesia’s founding stated that the energy released from the locust at the big quake on Friday had been about 200 times greater than that of the nuclear bomb that fell on Hiroshima’s city in World War II.
The geographic location of the city at the end of long and narrow fleas may have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said the damage was “real ” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped in a broken building, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss and damage to property could be greater along the shoreline 300 km north of Pala in an area called Donggala, near the onset of the earthquake.
Nugroho said that the communication “is completely down and no information is received ” from Donggala.
"Up to 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their employees and volunteers were on their way to the relevant area.
"This is already a tragedy, but could be much worse," said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not reporting that a flood had flooded Pala, although public representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on social media, you could hear a person yelling from the upper floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below that a flood was approaching.
Only minutes later, the tidal wave on the beach strikes and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video right away.
The earthquake and the tide caused powerlessness that prevented communication around Pala and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
The army has begun to send planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief and will be closed in October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit a refugee center in Pala on Sunday.
The number of dead goes over 800 after a flood wave in Indonesia.
Things are very bad.
The World Vision staff from Donggala have reached the city of Pala, looking for shelter in the camp cities that were set up in the garden outside their offices. Destruction was on their way, according to Mr. Dozeba.
“ People said they saw many houses destroyed, ” he said.
Things are very bad.
Help groups have started a difficult relief work, but some have complained that a foreign auxiliary worker with a high level of expertise is hindered from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, international funding, supplies and personnel can only begin to come if the disaster zone is declared a disaster zone.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a local accident area," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government has declared this to be a disaster zone, we can open up for foreign aid, but no declaration has yet come."
When the second night fell upon Pala after the earthquake and the floods on Friday, friends and their families who are still missing were hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous stories that shed hope on the depressing predictions of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers saved a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, an Indian glider coach, had trained two missing gliders for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were locked in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“ As a man with a long experience in flying, I have my own emotional load to carry, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he sent a message of desperation to the contestants who stayed in Pala and participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only a gray signal, rather than a blue one.
"I think that means that the messages were not received," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 in a rapid-bank filling in Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $2,750 of Brink’s employee, who was filling up a ATM in Newport on the Levee, as reported by the Newport Police.
The driver of the car had been emptying a fast bank in the entertainment area and was about to fill more money on it, said Dennis McCarthy, police officer, in the announcement.
When he was at work, another man “came running behind the Brink employee ” and stole a money bag that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing from the scene, according to the announcement, but police did not reveal how many were involved.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police on a telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name--to Ye.
Noting the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creature that was formerly known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change occurs before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi on the show, but she relinquished for “emotional reasons, ” said the producer of the factors.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a statue of his present name.
"I believe that "ye" (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier in the year when he spoke the name on his record to radio operator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and over to just Ye--to be merely a reflection of the good in us, the wicked, the confused, all.
The record is rather reflective of who we are."
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West collaborator, has also written his name both with and without a belt and a capital.
The choice of President Mexico is not to use the army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, president of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against public citizens, now the country will soon be silent for 50 years of a bloody revenge of students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised “never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, when the left - minded movements of students were shooting roots all over Latin America, soldiers shot at a peaceful protest march on the square.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attract young people to criminals.
The United States should double funds for artificial intelligence
Now that China is more and more active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of funding it has spent in research in that field, says the inventor and artificial user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The report was made after the various U.S. government departments issued reports on artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal overall strategy on artificial intelligence.
China, however, announced its plan last year: it is intended to be the first in a newly formed, artificially diagnosed by 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the amount of money that goes into artificial research, considering that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major discovery in artificial intelligence will be conducted in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director of the Sinovation Ventures company, which has invested in Face++, one of the major satellite companies in China.
In the 1990s, he worked as a mechanical engineer at the Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later became manager of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Armed Forces War, and asked when the next race would be held, to identify the next primer.
Scientists in the United States often have to put forth great effort to get the support of the government, said Lee.
"It's not China that's grabbing the main thought, it's the company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired geniuses from colleges to work on the artificially specified past few years.
Lee said that change in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its scientific research.
“ I feel that those with a doctorate should be granted leave of residence automatically, ” he said.
The Chinese Congress issued its future strategy in July 2017.
China’s Natural Science Institute provides funds for people who work at university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a satellite communications centre to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a special artificial intelligence committee.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it invests over 100 million dollars a year in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, U.S. legislation designed to provide safety advice on artificial intelligence has not continued for months.
The Macedonians vote in a national decree on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia decided to change the name of the country to the ‘North-Macedonian Republic’ in an attempt to resolve decades of disagreement with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and claims that its neighbours' names in the north are equivalent to those of their territory and therefore refused to enter NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the new name, but ethnic opposers argue that the change will undermine the independence of the majority of the inhabitants of Macedonia of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation would reach 50 percent of the minimum required to ensure that the vote is valid.
The question on the ballot box is: “Do you want to go to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the change of name, including Mr Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister, say that this is a fair price for Macedonia for joining the alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they could live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, many congressmen have said that they will apply it and bind it into law.
The name change would need to be accepted by two thirds of the Congress.
The Cosing Committee said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of participation in the last congressional elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son, Dushko, gave their vote in the National Counterfeiting in Macedonia on whether the country’s name should be changed, but it would provide its way into the NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the congregation in Skopje, 54 years old, Vladimir Kavardarkov worked on preparing a small area and setting up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who would ignore the vote.
"We are supportive of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service doors," said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO will contribute the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the country's citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after giving their vote.
He said that approval would be “confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the national vote payment, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another survey from Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were planning to make their vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would say yes.
So that the national vote is considered valid, a 50 percent vote must be one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock to the government’s policy, which is in favour of the Western countries, since it was adopted last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, an actor of Manchester City, goes through all of Brighton's defenses and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took lightly the defence of Brighton in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine forwarder received a shipment at the center of the field at the beginning of the visit.
He ran past three Brighton defensemen and then went out to the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four veneered defenders.
He got past one of the defenders and then ran off a few more times in front of Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling.
The English forwarder used the first touch within the dike to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, the target Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some foot problems," said Pep Guardola, manager of City, to the reporters.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky he scored a mark at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave them the blue first goal in the league.
That target arrived in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a shipment far inside Brighton's field half in that mission.
He sent a great long ball to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling toward the pole.
The future city sent the ball to the net just before he ran out.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Master's Department at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game against Rockies
Since the National team has been excluded from the conclusion, there was little reason to force another start.
But the enthusiastic Scherzer hopes to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has the chance to get to the finals, but they have one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies received at least a wildcard seat with their 5-2 victory at Nationals on Friday night, but the team still seeks to win their first division.
“ Even if we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as for the other team to play their best game this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals are still going to report who will be the first thrower in Sunday’s game, but it is estimated that they will have Scherzer throw in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start a 34th - time game, took a rehearsal session on Thursday and would throw it on Sunday, which is usually his Sabbath.
This right hand thrower in Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 blows in 220 2/3 cycles during this season.
Trump Visits West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, when he spoke of the importance of the supporters of the Republicans participating in the mid - period trials.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
It's five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big... I'm not offering myself, but I'm doing it though, that's why I'm going around a lot to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: “One can see this terrible, radical group of demonstrators, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to take control, they just want power and government, we don't give it to them.
He said that the democrats were working to “stood and hinder. ”
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, saying, "the Democrats are angry and wicked and cruel and untruthful."
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, a leading democrat in the district council, and was answered with a loud bell from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked the document?
Ha, what?
No, no, I waited in one... it was really bad body language, the worst I've seen."
The working class is no longer the tolerance of a church.
He Will Not Sustain Those Who Express His Mind
When the moments of action in my class chose to give me directions, it hardly surprised me.
After all, I am the last of many of the workers’ councils who have been told that we are not welcome, just to express our mind.
Joan Ryan, my associate, was treated similarly because she protested harsh prejudices against Jews.
In my case, the proposal to make a recommendation was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, ironically similar to Jeremy’s previous leaders.
The announcement of the Friday meeting for Nottingham East said that “we want the meetings to be nonexistent and effective. ”
During my eight - year career as a member of the Workers' Party, Friday meetings have been most common.
Sadly, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a “milder and better ” politics has been forgotten if it ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not yet held in the Workers’ Party and that all opinions are judged by whether the leaders of the class consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when co-workers, whom I once thought had similar political views, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support opinions I had never agreed on, whether they were national security or a common EU market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and then it doesn't matter what I say -- it's going to be a disgrace to the community media, where I'm called after my disfellowshipping, media politics denied, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my associates, since most of the speeches I receive are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and firmness of those who have to endure the fetters of sexual or prejudiced insults daily but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things during this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working class should pay attention to a more tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of the Church, and with every distrust or change in policy, the class becomes increasingly narrow.
For the past two years, I have received many counsels to let myself be low, not too high, and I would be “all right. ”
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers ’ Group as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my school in the downfall, I have fought for a better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in town or in Congress.
I have never placed my political views, nor at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can doubt my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will damage our home, business and public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Workers' Party.
But my only message that I want to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within me, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I serve you proudly and I promise that no threat of deviation or political disfellowshipping will prevent me from doing what I think is for the best benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered team Ayr goes to the top
Two late contact points could have distorted the final result something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory left in this horrific game of the day in the Tennt's Premiership department.
They are now in the top seat of the list and the only team of ten still undefeated.
Eventually, their defense and better use of opportunities made the locals more victorious, and a coach named Peter Murchie had the right to be happy.
“ We’ve had tough opposition in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Hopefully, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we do,"
Mark Grant Anderson came over Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the call, but a yellow card to the Scottish leader, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, made Melrose able to make the numbers number and Jason Baggot reached a touchdown.
Climo went on to lead Ayr with hell before he scored with a kick just before half a game and then touched the mark and came Ayr over 17-5 in half.
But Melrose started a second half of the force and touchdown Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned his approach, reduced the target to five points.
A long pause was then required to accommodate serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off the playground, and then Ayr continued to lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned to visit.
Blair Macpherson, Chief Ayr, then got the yellow board and Melrose used himself again to be a man with a touch limit from Bruce Colvine, at the end of his hard visit.
However, when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for pooling Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored the touch target behind the Ayr search, after extrapyramidal.
Climo turned to the visit, as he did again immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe caught David Amrstrong from hell and sent to Gregor Henry, who scored the fifth touch mark of the team.
The Star Still Game factors are ready for a new career in the restaurant restaurant
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game Factors, seems ready to move to a restaurant business after he found out that he was the manager of a restaurant business.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favourite parts, in which he writes and plays with his old partner from the entertainment business, Creg Hemphill.
It has been announced that the future ninth phase will be the last, and it seems that K has plans for Craiglang’s life - style.
According to official records, he's the manager of A driftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to say anything about the news, but Scottish Sun's source suggested that Krunch wanted to become a participant in the "living restaurant break" of Glasgow City.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia’s shoreless land hopes that a court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Sailors guard the naval headquarters of La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flag.
Titicaca fleets to the Amazon are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to regain it."
In many places, however, all the landlocked Bolivia’s reminder of the shoreline that was lost to Chile in bloody struggles in the 19th century, still in a fresh memory — along with the desire to sail through the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the International Court of The Hague on October 1, after five years of long legal proceedings.
“ Bolivia has the power, the conspirator, and the avarice, and, of course, is waiting for the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide on the obligation of Chile to have access to Bolivia after decades of difficult discussions.
Monday’s decision is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the Indian family, who will have a controversial fight for next year’s elections.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
However, some scholars find that Bolivia’s ruling in favor of the court is unlikely, and that it would little change if he did.
The court, with its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to give a country from Chile and has ruled that the decision will not affect the conclusion of the possible proceedings.
The fact that the judgment of the Court comes only six months after the final hearing indicates that the matter “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that over the last four years Bolivia has not been the case for extension, but it has caused the country to return.
"The current Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
Morale’s harsh speech has diminished all her well - being from Chile, she thought.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss this at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after that.
The two countries have not changed to ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusual short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a unique opportunity to open up to a new relationship with Chile” and an opportunity to“ put an end to a conflict that will last 139 years, both countries for good, ” he said.
So Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject as a political hook.
“ Bolivia will never give in to its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to recover in the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
Mr. Ri Yong Ho, Secretary of State of North Korea, says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons until it can't trust Washington.
Ri held his speech on Saturday at the United Nations Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with their promises at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His remarks are now coming up as Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State of the United States, seems to be about starting talks again about nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “dramatical” to think that the continued trade and opposition of the United States against a declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever be ravaged by North Korea.
Washington does not wish to accept the statement unless Pyongyang first takes action to decommission his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, major doubts prevail that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country is likely looking at as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion tours in Paris present the latest line of big head clothes that will come to fashion stores near you
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not need to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a lot of weird hats in supersizes for their SS19 line on the fashion field that captivated the fashion week in Paris.
Many pictures of highly unsuitable hats have been published on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their recent creations on fashion shows.
Valentino’s main work was a large light - brown hat with wide stripes resembling feathers, covering the head of the motels.
Of other supersized components, watermelons could be seen putting gemstones, cedar hats, and even pineapple, but these things are not designed to keep a temperature on their heads.
Thom Browne also introduced many strange masks, especially at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high - fashioned lips.
One mask resembled a suffocation system with breathing pipe and glasses, while others were similar to an icing in bread form.
If you want to go to class, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in the fashion store near you.
Large hats add a dose to the heels of “La Bomba”, a straw hat with more than 60cm of weight that has adorned the head from Rihöna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The symbol behind the extremely unsightly hat seen on all social media was inspired by another large component that appeared in the fashion field — a straw - lined beach bag that was almost as large as the flat - flat model that carried it.
The orange strawbag, with stripes and white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 coat line Jacquemus on the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a stylist of the famous people, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beachbags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer – since the designer has caused such a great impact, it should be difficult to ignore oversized demand for follow-up items. ”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Schools in Scotland are well - known for the outstanding achievements of their students, and they have continued in 2018 with new, magnificent tests, which are still supported by individual and group success in sports, art, music, and other social activities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further secondary schooling, the career they have chosen, and their position as a citizen of the world.
As a teacher who can put together and teach personalized study records, we see that new language continues to be a popular study material in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother's language, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely only on English to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
Test results this year show us that language is at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students passing private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received A.
The data collected from 74 schools within the SCIS showed that 72 percent of the students received the excellent grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French, and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
At the moment, languages are set in the same place as scientific subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons given by employers that work was difficult, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future work.
Now that more and more jobs are required in languages, this ability is needed in a world that is clean of the globe.
No matter what career people choose, they will have real advantages in the future if they learn another language, but they are skills that last their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multiplicity of individuals the advantage of the rivals.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in more than 4,000 adult British people in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two counts of percentages, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language training.
Multiplier, especially in emerging countries, will give children a better opportunity to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from one school to another.
A certain number of schools will focus on more classics, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Schools in Scotland commit themselves to offering a study environment that will prepare and prepare children with the skills they need to achieve success, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a fast - paced business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
Really, modern language should be viewed as “an international skill in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, variety, and excellence for Scotland’s young people.
It's an ugly bee.
John Edwards is chairman of the Scottish Private School Board
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The waiting is soon to end for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, coach Lakers, has announced that James will be playing on Sunday in the opening game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked out in his plans for the six games program Lakers before the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare myself, ” he said.
Timings for Trump's election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election sessions and the first is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, since he will also stop at the winery sites, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election of a new Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump aims to build up support for the subsequent mid-term elections, for the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the assembly when voting will take place in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can he be seen online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is due to begin at 7:00 p.m. to the east end of the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the web below through the live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will refer the case to Brett Kavanaugh, a high court appointed, in which the accusations of sexual responsibility are full of excitement, and the Senate's decision to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the allegations.
However, the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans reach a better position, but they are awaiting difficult elections in November.
Thus, the message from Trump’s campaign was that these five meetings that will be held next week are aimed at “filling volunteers and supporters with enthusiasm as the Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and Congress ” according to Reuter’s news office.
"The government over the assembly is so necessary for the President's plan that he will travel to as many prisons as possible now that a busy campaign begins," said an unnamed spokesman from Trump's campaign to Reuter's press office.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and the media from Pittsburgh will report to him," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's meeting will be another visit of Trump to West Virginia this month, but he won with over 40 percent in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the candidate of the Republicans in West Virginia to the Senate, but he's in the polls below.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come and try to increase his popularity," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters' press office.
The Ryder Cup 2018: The United States is showing willingness to fight to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one - sided rings, the foursome, which was on Saturday afternoon, could be just what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Successful swings are a sport that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in the race like this.
Where would they say that success is now diminishing?
"They had six points ahead of them, and now it's four points, so that success is more on our side now, I suppose," said Jordan Spieth when he started the race today.
Of course, Europe has a head start, four points ahead with an additional twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe that they have a little wind in their sails, and they can be hopeful of many, especially the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each of which got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a far-off course, leading by his example.
The cheerleader went up as he went on the ring, and he put down an important putt to pick up all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two games.
His captor, who assured them victory in the 15th - hole game, had a similar shout of joy, crying out of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has a hope of victory.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to win a score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas for the past two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder.
This strange but charming European couple has won four games of four and can't do anything wrong.
“Moliwood ” was the only couple on Saturday to have a bad night, but they also managed to avoid spills on Saturday mornings, on Friday afternoons, and on Friday mornings.
The game and their energy seem to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the European team's potential victory, but Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun sets over the Le Golf National field.
The best option would be for both to do so at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the quadruple in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spaniards and the Swedes dug two doubles into a hole that they could never scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quadruples and the four games are so exciting to watch in close proximity because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how a game program can change in one way.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable head start for the final day, but these four - game races also showed that the American team had the will to fight, some had doubts that it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will be well ahead of Ryder’s final day after the quadruple and quadruple Saturday, with an advance of 10-6 versus the United States.
The astronomer Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, and have scored four points at the Le Golf National field.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to return to the prize troupe, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the United States team in the quarter game of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed greater opposition in the four leagues and won two games but failed to earn the score.
Jim Furyks had to score eight from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fletwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who were nicknamed “Molliwood” after a wonderful weekend, are just another pair who win four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quadruple game, they showed great teamwork and won the defeat of Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius several times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in quadruples and fours and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the four-ball game of the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the quadruple and won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
Europe, however, did not go all the way to this mild and hospitable day southwest of Paris.
Three times a winner in the big golf race, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulties 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in the quadruple games and came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quadruple after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that team has won four points, even though Furich’s team would only have to have equal powers to continue the cup.
After two days of being best, however, a counterattack on Sunday appears to be overpowering.
North Korea says one-sided disarmament "unfortunately" without trust
On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State of North Korea told S.H.L. that continuing trade offers only shone on their distrust in the United States and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
In the annual General Assembly of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho said that in recent years, for example, nuclear and missile tests had taken off the nuclear test site and promised to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no guarantee of our country’s security, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons alone first. ”
Although Ri has repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to “subverted” nuclear disarmament, where North Korea was rewarded for every step it took, his declaration seemed special in that he did not deny one-sided nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had previously done.
Mr Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the U.S. President-in-Office of the North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim was supposed to work on the "Koreuskagan nuclear disarmament" and Trump issued a promise to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to formalize the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons after the first time.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the strict trade ban against North Korea.
"The United States demands that "nuclear weapons take place first" and increase the pressure by using commercial orders to achieve their goal, and even contradict the declaration to end the war," said Ri.
“ There are only fantasies of people who don’t know anything about us to think that our business prayers can get us down.
But the problem is that our distrust continues to grow."
There was no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, the U.S. leader of the United States earlier this week.
The Secretary spoke instead of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, leader of South Korea for the past five months, adding: "If the party to this nuclear weapon case were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the case of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Gulf."
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from his speech last year when he said in the General Assembly that it would be inevitable to launch rockets from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after "the demonic president" Trump called Kim "a firefighter" on a suicide mission.
In the first year, Trump threatened to “wealth” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage in taking steps to disarm; but he said that a great deal of work was still to be done, and that a trade offer would have to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying: “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
On the other hand, Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State at the Security Council on Thursday, said: “The Security Council’s request must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it is confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to extend its business offer to North Korea from 2006 onward in an effort to close funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile plans.
Mr. Pompeo met Mr. Ri on the sideline at the General Assembly of the United States and then said that he would visit Mr. Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not work well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “heavy demands.”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down the missiles and nuclear power station if the United States resorted to "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had said that the “corresponding actions ” he sought were guarantees of security that Trump promised in Singapore and measures aimed at normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take a course in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to resist the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
Research revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing about the basics of self - concern.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and considered the first species in the United States.
He was given the idea of taking the course after giving a lecture on the effect of lack of sleep on a study.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, “Why is this being said to me first now, in my final year?”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The study, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help students to get a job in sports and even promote general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the health service of the school, said that after studying the course, the university decided that students were very sleepy over the week.
The study is an hour long and involves various interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance can worsen with lack of sleep, along with the importance of good routine before sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how long-term lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“ We know that this will not change student behavior at the same time.
But we feel that they should know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that greets those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
The assurance of getting enough sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid fat, for lack of sleep increases the demand for food so that the body is sloppy.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor's desks last year in his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master students to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider setting a alarm clock that reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and to consider the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Menga shoots Gerrard's men down
Rangers were still in trouble at the camp when Stevens Gerrards' team split up with a 1-0 loss of Livingston, to the point of Dolly Menga.
The team of Ibrox wanted to win their first victory at the branch after their victory at St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt gave Gerrard's team only his second loss in 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points after the Hearts, which is in the top seat of the Ladbrokes Premiership department.
Menger scored seven minutes before half the game, and Rangers seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to equal.
Rangers now fall to sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only after the Hibernian in goal sense.
Rangers may have some further trouble after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for head injury after some items were thrown into it from the visitors' half-field.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came to the fore in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, adhered to the same Livi 11 arrangement that reached a level of Hearts last week, and he was pleased with the way his well - trained officers ruled over the opposition.
Rangers may have had more with the ball, but Livingston created more chances with the ball it got.
They should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he passed by.
A long extra fight from Keaghan Jacobs ended with Craig Halkett, while Alan Lithgow, his defense partner, passed the remote pole.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live more in hope than belief in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have received a hell of a hell when a quarter of a man was out of the game, when he and Steven Lawless merged, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Columbian's appeal.
Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, a former target Ibrox, did not have much to defend baldness from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Oviedo.
Although Livi’s 34 - minute opportunity had come despite the other team’s overreach, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their endurance.
Rangers failed again to do anything of Jacob's long-standing extravagance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmed down and chose to send to Menga, who then cut easily.
Gerrard took his advice in half and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly, and the switch almost immediately affected when the rear guard came in Morelos, but Kelly reacted quickly and ran forward to close the shot.
However, Livingstone continued to fool the guests into playing just the kind of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long shipment after another.
The team of Holts could have increased their leadership in the final aminerals, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs an opportunity before Lithgow ran to the point from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's agent, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson turned it down again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our “Sunday Morning” newspaper: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and AFFRAM... This is the day that future geographer Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to a device called Geiger’s measuring device.
The Geiger meter has gained a permanent place in the scientific world since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in different roles as scientists:
Man: “What on earth is this?
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s measurement, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put this hearing aid on you, you can hear the effects from the atoms due to the radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It really is breaking now! ”
"His" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63 - year - old birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory
Then they can see a “sight” protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and then be injected back into the patient.
Experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognise dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves the removal of the patient’s immune cells and the conversion to a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer, followed by the re-injection of the cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “Letting cancers stop growing, ” said Professor Berzofsky,“ including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon and rectum. ”
Similar methods of immune cells being taken from patients and the “characteristics” of attacking cancer cells have been effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long monologue to support Trump and carried MAGA there hats after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well.
In the studio of Saturday Night Live, where he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said that he would invite himself to the president by 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke long against the democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“ I have spoken so often to white people who say, ‘ How can you like Trump? He is a racial hater? ’
If I were worried about racial hatred, I would be long moved from the United States," he said.
SNL began with a stick where Hollywood star Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Committee of Senior Officials on the charge of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment.
Although the Long - Distance West had not been released, her recording was put on a social media channel by Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad receptions from a backfield because of his cape whale.
“ I was rearranged.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the stage with this hood. ”
They bugged me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to reports from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole? ” and said that he would put on his superhero robe, “because that means you can’t give me a job, do you want the world to make progress?
Try love."
His comments were accompanied by a trophy from the audience at least twice, and actors from SNL seemed disgraceful, according to Variety, and one present said to the newspaper, “There was a silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to join the part instead of the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his performance as he sang the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, the chairman of the TPUSA conservative class, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: TO THINK FOR A MESSAGE. ”
But the chat director Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West is simply being “he himself and that’s quite wonderful. ”
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art ”) whom I feel to be supporting and spreading my harmful society’s ideology.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the creature that was formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the music legend Prince named, who turned his name into a symbol and later called himself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Indictment for a murder attempt after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old has been charged with a murder attempt after being stabbed to a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.

The defendant is expected to attend a courtroom in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will take charge of the charges.
Kit Harington, star of the Crown Games, criticizing poisoned masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old actor, however, has criticized the standard picture of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be tough in order to gain respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisoned manhood in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his companion from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong views ” on how to deal with this matter.
"Perhaps I feel right now--what has gone wrong with masculinity?"
"What have we taught men in their growth, the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleism, because of the highly male person on TV.
He continued: “What is incarnate, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel like they must be a certain kind of man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the day--how do we do this?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also admitted during the interview that he would not play in any other rounds after the next summer of the series, saying that he had received “a lot of battlefields and horses. ”
From November, Kit will be re-creating the True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of the movie producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing the Crown Games was seeing his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these things, so that they gave me my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's beloved wife, who Kit played in these Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of Lesli’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
The health authorities say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections involved sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV virus was rapidly spread in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infected persons in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a Yunnan District conference.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from one year to the next.
Sexual HIV infection is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Although homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, there is still much discrimination against LGBT.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised access to all HIV medicines as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from the Republican Congressmen, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy"
On Saturday, Senator Maxine Waters denied the accusations that one of her employees had published personal information from the three Republican Congressmen on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles said that these claims came from “supervised ” extremists and Web sites.
“ Lies, lies, and other shitty lies, ” said Waters in a Twitter statement.
According to the published information, the U.S. Congressmen Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah, contained home records and telephone numbers.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party to Capitol Hill during the hearings at the Senate department at Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court, on the grounds of the accusations of sexual content.
Some time after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh, the play came.
The conservatives, such as Gateway Poundit and RedState, said that the IP numbers that identify the source of the information were connected to the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, according to the information provided by Capitol Hill.
"This undeclared accusation is completely false and pure lies," Waters continued.
“My staff member — each personal information and security — is now at risk because of these false accusations — in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This undeclared accusation is absolutely false and pure lies."
Water’s statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House reporter.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
“ It suggests that she does not have the temper to sit on a council.
When a person is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
There must be no opposition.
There must be no question about the cause of the accusation.
It must be calm and thoughtful."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who said that the critics had seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the leading Republicans against Waters during the mid - period trials, also commented on Twitter.
"A big thing if it's true," he coughed.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had “an appropriate authority and law enforcement officer had been informed of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and that they will be blamed for all the work that is damaging and dangerous to all my employees."
Film review for Johnny English Strikes again - a spy green picture with Rowan Atkinson proves to be a little bit of power
It has become a custom now to look for Brexit references in all new films where Britain comes from, and it seems to be the case in this resurgence of the Johnny English comic book series - which began in 2003 with the image Johnny English and just woke up again in 2011 with the image Johnny English Reborn.
Will this potential satire tell us how clearly we are a new export facility for the country?
Either way, or not, Johnny English has been given renewed permission for the second time to scramble everything - his name shows above all that he is designed for display in other than English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the wisest mystery servant who pretends to have charming personalities but is a little bit of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little hustle of the man who played one note for Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious city of the world that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he separated everything from himself in turmoil.
It's one or two good points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking on a helicopter wearing a middle-belt brow and the chopper blades wearing his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his humorousness, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that “serious” movies such as James Bond and the Mission Impressive photos also offer a mockery of humor.
The joke seems to be for children rather than adults, and I felt the adventure that Johnny English had not been as imaginative and focused as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the form of Mr. Beans.
The lasting basis for this picture is that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into the secret spynet of Britain and has identified the identity of all British spies, to the detriment of the spy on duty - which Kevin Eldon regrets is too small to play.
This is the final line for the prime minister, who is arrogant and controversial, and already in great trouble because of enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best in his role as a person who should remind Theresu May, but the manuscript is not many fish for her.
Her counselor tells her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already been stoned.
And that's where Johnny English himself comes from, now head of school in some fancy school, but also gives a secret lesson in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers at a spy school that reminds of the school of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting where Bough, her former long-tired partner, who is playing Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submariner, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let his light shine.
The spy-navy who scrambles everything in her service of Majesty has now come back into the gir and meets the hazy woman Ophelia Bulletova, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is to be impressed by the charms of the fascinating billionaire within the technology sector, who claims to be able to solve the computer problem of Britain: that is the ill Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their downfall journeys: they turn up in a fine French restaurant disguised as slaves, they pick up a noise as they smuggle into Volta's luxury nest, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual eyeglasses to introduce himself to the interior of Volta's house.
There is nothing to save in that final point, but although the image is lively and energyy, some of the child’s material in it is ignored in its entirety.
Medium substance.
And just as with the other Johnny English photos, I couldn't help but think: can British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talents?
The working class refuses to make a plan for a four - day week work week for the British, with the same salary as five days ago.
The working class, headed by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, managers want companies to benefit from savings from the revolution in artificial intelligence, and to benefit employees by having one extra day.
Then employees may enjoy three days of weekends without cutting their wages.
Sources say that the idea would “fit” the group’s economic strategy and its policy of improving workers’ interests.
The Trades Union Congress has supported the four-day work week as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior source of the Workers’ Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"The change will not take place in one night, but four days of work week is an objective that fits with the group's approach to changing economic interests for the benefit of workers and the group's overall industrial policy."
The working class would not be the first group to support this idea, but the green group promised a four - day week campaign in 2017.
The objective, however, is not supported by the Workers’ Party as a whole.
The spokesperson of the working class said: “A four - day work week is not on the group’s policy sheet, and the group is not considering introducing it. ”
John McDonnell, Secretary of Business of the Academy of Shadows, used the Working Party’s conference last week to describe his ideas about social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "unidentified managers" and "fruit collectors" of industry.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current water companies' shareholders may not be able to recover all their share, since the working party's government could resort to "disposal" because of alleged misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers in management boards of companies and to create a joint ownership fund to transfer 10 percent of the assets of private companies to their employees, who may receive 500 pounds of them annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether an investigation by the FBI on Kavanaugh could cause them to change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court, and raises the question as to whether its findings could have the Republican Senates withdraw their support.
In an interview scheduled on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the 60 minutes of the Republicans and senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial began, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations were made and asked, “Did you do this?”
He was determined, steadfast, without question."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to be an incredible accusation to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly refused it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she named couldn’t confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old case.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the international civil festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York, New York. It is an annual music event in which a series of big stars will appear and with similar powerful policies; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the international civil festival, and tens of thousands of people will make their way to Central Park, not only to listen to music from among others Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to highlight the real goal of the festival of ending severe poverty by 2030.
The 2012 International Civil War, which was first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, a global struggle that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), musicians needed to complete various projects, or “actions”, such as volunteering, e - mailing to some of the world’s leaders, calling calls, or using other valid ways to help raise attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now that it has been for 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free music a real way of persuading people to call for action, or is it just one so-called "smelling action" - since people feel they are doing something that matters by signing a list of requirements on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million 'operations' from its supporters, to call for many different goals.
It says that these actions helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will affect life over $2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group estimated 390 commitments and notifications for its operations, including investment or collection of at least 10 billion dollars.
So far, the group estimates that the accumulated funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in Britain, who are working to “help children to enjoy themselves fully,” and promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With support from the British Government, sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustices that malnutrition is a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition to the audience at the concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government reported on project funding, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and give them better nutrition.
A list of common questions on the group’s website raises one question: “Why do you think you can end up with severe poverty?
Global citations replied: “There will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will always fail.
However, we will reach our goal, just like movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the rejection of racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among the participants in this year’s event are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae. The event will be held in New York, and the students are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as an obstacle to the export of energy to Russia, says the Minister of the Interior
"If necessary," says the U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Ziinke, " Washington could use the Navy to prevent energy from reaching the market in Russia, including the Middle East.
Zinke argued that Russia’s assistance to Syria, especially where the country operates in the hands of the legitimate government there, was suggested to explore new markets.
"I believe the reason for their presence in the Middle East is then that they want to do business with energy as in Eastern Europe and its southern parts," he should have said according to the sources.
And, according to the public announcement, there are ways and means to resist it.
"The United States can use the Navy to ensure that shipping is open and, if necessary, to create an obstacle to ensuring that the energy from them is not available on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the guest meeting at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called itself the “root of the U.S. energy supply. ”
He continued and joined Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are more and less profitable for energy supplies and to distribute them to others," he said, saying, "and Russia has only one economic card in its heat that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as a result of Trump's wish to increase its export of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, government officials in Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the 'inappropriate' Nord Stream 2 project to set up new power lines, which Trump says would make Berlin 'catch' Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars Nord Stream 2 power supply, which will double the current transmission capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
Russians say that strong opposition from Washington to the project is simply continued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I feel that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supply,” said Alexander Novak, Minister for Energy of Russia, after a meeting with Mr. Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to change its energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I’m very unhappy that the foreign state is sharing our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" to propose to the President's office in 2020, says she
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would “consider seriously ” to invite herself to the president after the Middle Ages.
Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself for a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and sort out our government, and then also needs a woman as a leader," she said, according to the report from The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider seriously inviting myself to the office of President."
Speaking of President Donald Trump at the meeting, Warren said that he was “walking the country in the wrong direction.
“ I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been envious of his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his high court judge.
Friday, Warren told Twitter that “of course we must have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote. ”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren’s county do not feel that it should be offered by 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not volunteer, according to a survey published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent said they supported her proposal.
The survey showed greater support for the return of former governor Deval Patrick, who claimed 38 percent to support his potential bid, and 48 percent claimed to be against it.
Among other popular democrats who were discussed for a possible presidential election by 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senior Vice President Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make a public decision in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the shock disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, aged 26, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night
“ My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel like other families suffering from a shock disorder and the spiritual wounds that our soldiers are returning home with, ” she said to the audience at a campaign meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that her son and other warriors“ returned only differently, they are hardened and wondering if any respect is paid for what their partners in the army and the air forces and other sectors of the army have done for the country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent the announcement of domestic violence and the execution of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and Washington D.C. support challenge against a new asylum search policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against a new policy of the United States that refuses victims fleeing a barrage or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 countries and the city submitted a trial report on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker who opposes the policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions' prosecution, which the American Civil Liberty Union has brought against the federal policy, has not been given.
She said that her mate “and his violent sons, who were gentiles, ” used her violence, but the U.S. government officials rejected her application for refuge on July 20.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and home violence are constantly increasing, many of the asylum seekers to the United States come from these countries.
In 2014, the new asylum seeker revoked a decision issued by the Board of Appeal of Immigration to allow unregistered immigrants who fled home violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Washington State Attorney, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has gone through decades of federal and international law."
"The federal law requires a decision to be made on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule," said the report.
Furthermore, in the report, lawyers said that the policy that denied immigrants entry was harmful to the economy of the United States and claimed that immigrants were more likely to set up businesses and “have significant labour. ”
Jeff Sessions, a U.S. prosecutor, ordered immigration judges to stop giving refuge to victims who fled home violence and violent acts of violence in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular community or political opinion can apply for asylum, ” said Sessions in his report on the 11th June.
Healing companies were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people encounter every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Pala, the number of dead doubled
Situations are becoming increasingly difficult for survivors.
“ There’s a lot of excitement in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother who comforted her sick son at the relief center in Pala.
“ Hospital cars keep bringing bodies here.
There's little about clean water."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined homes and searched for their watery possessions to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, lay outside the Pala military hospital, where patients were happy to be outside due to continued strong post-exposure.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of how he found his earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pressed up to the walls, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Secretary of State accuses China of "prosecution" with "protests of propaganda"
Week after a public newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassadors in China accused them of using American media to disperse propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, last Wednesday, spoke of the Chinese newspaper’s advertisement in the newspaper Des Moines Register, which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to get involved in the United States Congress elections on November 6, China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections marked what official U.S. representatives said Reuters’ news office was a new step in a rising campaign from Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington have a continuous business war, with new customs duties on both countries’ import products.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that China’s revenge interpreters were designed early in the business war to harm immigrants in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa to the long term, but it filled out a lot of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad, in his introduction to the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, stated that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of its beloved American language freedom and our free media by publishing the advertised costs in the Des Moines Register magazine, ” said Branstad.
“ On the other hand, there are few protestors in Beijing’s newspaper booths, and no real reflection can be found on the various views that Chinese people might have on China’s worrying economic policy, where the media are trapped under the Chinese Communist Party’s heel, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China escaped the offer to publish ” his article, but he did not state what magazine it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters dissuade them before the mid-term trials with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, during the upcoming mid - term trials, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court, who has accused the sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been surrounding this matter, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start voting.
"These things cannot be backed up," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School, Syracuse University, at The Hill, for an article published on Saturday.
Mr. Reeher said that in the last minute of an investigation by the FBI, Mr. Jeff Flake, Senator of the Republicans of Arizona, was in doubt about how to calm down the voters.
“ Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow and not November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, the director and spokesman for the liberal group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “Norway! ” as they protested in the corridors of the elders ’ department when the Republicans who presided over the jury decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go out of control, ” said Stu Rothenberg, regardless of the political leader, to the news site.
“ People will say that interest has already been great, and that is true.
But he could be greater, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years of age who dislike the President, but rarely choose."
The researchers predicted a setback if the Republicans urged the confirmation of Kavanaugh, even for Ford’s testimony, as she explained her accusations about his sexual argument.
“ This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, former member of the Republican Party Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“The issue is not just about the committee’s vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that helps to vote for democrats, at the news centre.
On the other hand, the United States seems to disagree with who should believe in both Ford and Kavanaugh witnessing, and a small majority support the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents surely believed or probably believed the Ford testimony, while 35 percent claimed to believe in Kavanaugh’s sure or probable testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's appeal, the FBI is now investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by Guardian.
Ford witnessed the oath before the Senate Committee last week and said that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh wore sex organs in front of her when they were both at a party at Yale University in the 1990 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to set up a sprat company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the engineering legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, open-ended Berners-Lee.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that the intention behind Inrupt was “the rule of the world.”
"We have to do this now," he said about the sprat company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal data store on the Internet ” or POD.
There may be a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work - related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one web and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data store is that it is completely up to the user who can have access to any information.
The company calls it “personal selection by using data. ”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea is that Inrupt provides the company with resources, procedures and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security department purchased by IBM, several programmers hired as contractors to work on the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
From this week on, engineers around the world could create their own independent programs with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not discuss with the “Facebook and Google whether or not a complete change would trigger that would put their current business model on the head in one night.
"We don't ask them permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt had “a goal to create energy in business and ecosystem that helps to protect the honesty and quality of the new Solid web.”
Berners-Lee traded the network in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the discussion on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes up with Inrupt.
"I'm full of optimism for the next online period," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Won: Honored priest and handman of the Victorian Cross from World War I
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Crusade during the first world war as a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglice and Lehaucourt, Father Bernard Vann, who was in the position of the military commander, received the cross.
However, a sniper killed him four days later, and he never learned that he had received the British army’s highest honor.
On Saturday, two of his grandfathers exposed a memorial of him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the memory was exposed exactly 100 years from his grandfather’s honorary record.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led the Canal de Saint-Quentin trench “through a very thick fog and under a severe gun-and-gun attack.”
Later, he ran to the line of fire, and with “great courage, ” he continued the line before attacking a gun of his own and brimming three soldiers.
An underpriest was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just months before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s heroic death was “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he had “a great privilege of participating in the parade ” and added that“ the daughters of true hero are shown by the support so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of seeing Gurra piglets
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206 just to be refused to see the main event.
The program featured 13 battle days from San Jose, six of them on the main program, and they were shown on live broadcast all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers got an unexpected appearance when the broadcast changed to Gurra pig.
Some were dissatisfied after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the change to the child’s subject as “any kind of sick joke. ”
"According to official rules, the material was not suitable for audiences at six o'clock in the morning so they had to switch to children's material," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of the market and communications for Bellator, when he was asked to the broadcast.
"Gurra pig, yes."
Scott Coker, President Bellator, said that they would go over their schedules and take viewers in Britain into account in the future.
"I think when I think about the show, we could probably sort it out," said Coker.
“ But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can’t solve this until Sunday at our time, which is Monday at their disposal.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix this. We thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limited the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and passed out.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “unease” due to sexual orientation
Olympic duke Tom Daley claims to have experienced maladies toward other people in their growing up because of their sexual tendencies, but he was encouraged to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that "he was different" until he went to high school. ”
On the Radio Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his parental role reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, a regular member of the team, has taken several months off for illness.
Daley was able to take over the first part of Laverne and said that he felt he was a "minor man" but everyone else when he was a child because "it was not agreed in the community to be fond of both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings about feeling inferior and otherwise have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone at the end of his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronze Sea has been a great supporter of LGBT and has used its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he said he heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The world champion said that he had been “intimidated” to fall in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oskar Prize winner, 20 years older than he, last year but said that the difference in age had never been a problem.
"When a man passes through so much at a young age"--but he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was difficult to find the same age as had experienced similar success and difficulty.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “all life views ” had been suppressed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold prize," he said.
“ Know what, these are more important things than the gold prize at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic Gold Award."
His son is baptized in the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years of age, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last questions was whether they had received their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until his breath stopped, and he was let that I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, diving in front of the audience at home at the Olympic Games. It doesn’t feel better, ” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song--Proud by Heather Small--which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in bad shape and let sit on the class in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson is going to record Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his old beat again so that the score is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the race for the 12th time, was assigned to sit on the bench after the decision of leader Jim Fuwerk for the four-ball and four-game races on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hare, as he has been so often before for the United States, the day is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing the playing rhythms on the field in hopes of correcting what is happening to him.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot the second with the triggers, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, since longing flashes often punish for bad shots.
And not enough for the golf course to be a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson must compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the new Tommy Fleetwood team and together they have won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below them when they play the first of 12 solo games, get started, Mickelson’s game could be a play.
Fuër expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, clapped my back and took care of me and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He's in the famous hall, and he's been so much better for the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and we thought we had to go that way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit with Nick Faldo in the number of played games in Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could market the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never reached quite as high as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and 7 equals, but Fury said that his presence had a vague effect on the team.
"He's funny, he's ironic, he's cute, he likes to make fun of people, and it's great to have him in the room," he explained.
“ I think the younger players loved to tease him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's leader knows that a great advance can be lost quickly
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows from the experience that a good advantage for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily be changed in an uncomfortable experience.
The Dan first played in the Valderrama in 1997, where the side under the leadership of the leader Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but was just able to squeeze out the victory at the end with the lowest possible score, with 1411⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of head start in Valderrama, we had a lot of head start in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only right then,” said Bjorn, who is shown here in the picture, after watching the 2018 vintage work 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and getting the lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over yet.
We'll all hang out tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not done until all the levels are on the tablet.
We have our goal and we're trying to win this cup, we're focusing on it.
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very conscious of our other team's resistance fighters--the best golfer in the world."
Bjorn was delighted with the hard work done by his players, adding: “I will never get over myself in this.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
Tomorrow, it is the person’s performance that matters, and that is another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you play one you try on all man's talents as a golfer.
It's the message that needs to be sent to the players, getting the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive for his players to be better in individual games than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fury himself has experienced both sides of this great transformation on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline, but he ended up losing when Europe performed “the miracle in Medinah. ”
"I remember every fucking word," he replied asking how Ben Crenshaw, the late 1999 Crenshaw, had encouraged his players before the last day.
“ We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When that creeps closer to being built up, it puts a lot of pressure on the game in the middle.
We ordered our players according to it and let them play as we think it will be best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this row because I think they're all going through," said Bjorn of his choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany’s New Armed Forces Restored Again
The latest German Navy military force should have been built in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but it will not be prepared until the first time in the next year due to broken systems and increasing costs, according to news in the area.
The building on the “Rheinland-Palatinate,” the leadership ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the sources of the army spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit.
The ship was to be taken advantage of by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the project was handed down.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class military ships, which have arrived in their years.
They should be equipped with a powerful cannon, multiple aerial and marine missiles, and field technology such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer time spent – it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
On the other hand, constant delay means that these most recent warships - which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength at sea - will be obsolete when they are finally taken for advantage, says Die Zeit.
The F125 warship arrived last year when the German army officially refused to accept the chip and returned it to the Blohm & Voss escape in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
The reasons behind the divorce were well known, but German media spoke of a number of women who were seriously “injured in software and hardware ” who would make the military a useless battle.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg group will be controlled by 120 crews, which are half less than on Bremen-class military ships.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Navy to improve it in the future.
The 7,000 tonnes ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships in the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from mechanical defects, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is causing problems.
It was said to have reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), originally estimated to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest ships are particularly important in view of the warning that German superiority on the seas is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually becoming "carrying with a ship capable of operation."
The representative said that the problem had overtaken him, for older ships were taken out of service but no ships were replaced.
He regretted that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Nature Conservation Association is spying on the secret life of bats
A new study in the territory of the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they fish for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future nature conservation operations.
The study, which scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Environmental Protection Agency will monitor various species of bats in the Inverewe farms of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather flaps over the period.
NHS and volunteers will also be on surveillance missions with handheld sensors.
Experts will record all recordings to find out the frequency and type of coldness of the bats.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be published to produce an accurate picture of their geographic behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s Net Ruvalite Counsellor, hopes that the results reveal the type of habitat that is most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of land management, e.g. by making no eggs, and how best to maintain forestland for bats and other related species.
In the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain, bats have decreased significantly.
They are at risk from building and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitats.
Windmills and light can also pose risks, including fly paper and certain efficiencies in building materials, as well as domestic attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears do much better than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because they are used to fishing at night.
They use highly developed irradiation technology to locate insects and objects on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organizations employ ten experts who perform regular checkups, nest checks, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and only batsmanland of Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten batsman species in Scotland live.
David Thompson, the farm overseer, says that he is the perfect area for them.
"The area at Threeave is great for bats," he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of growing trees and lots of good living areas.
But there are still many things not known about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to trim."
He stressed the importance of checking bats before maintaining shelters, since the possibility of accidental destruction in one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people and destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and they are forbidden to kill, harass, or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how well many of their species are going. ”
Ronaldo denies accusations of rape when lawyers prepare legal proceedings against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations against him about the rape of "false stories" and says that people want to "pay attention" by using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The forwarder for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 in return for keeping the incident, according to Der Spiegel's news on Friday.
A few hours after the accusations were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, in Instagram Live video told 142 million followers that they were “false stories. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion fivefold to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player to smile.
The lawyers Ronaldos are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations they have called “an unacceptable display of the suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters’ news office.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand “the same amount as the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The alleged incident has occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and the Las Vegas casino.
After having met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayora went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her in the rectory, according to documents submitted for Clark County in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after a serious incident and told her that he was "99 percent good man" who was tempted by "one percent."
The documents argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they had both agreed.
According to Mayorga, she went to the police and had her injuries taken in a hospital, but finally agreed to be seated outside the court, for she was “afraid of revenge” and worried about becoming “publicly humiliated.”
She now says she wants to quit her seat, for she is still in shock after a alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due to take place, and in the summer he went over to Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euros contract.
Brexit: Britain would “see to it forever” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “keep an eye on it forever ” if it lost its position as an international leader among the car manufacturers of Brexit, says Greg Clark, Secretary of Business.
He added that it was 'anxious' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain moved from the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily stop manufacturing its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit without a contract were to be a reality, the effect would be that it would cost a job.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were transported to other European Union countries.
"I believe that if Britain is decommissioned from the EU at the end of March, we will see production stations in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about exits from the EU without consent on how to conduct inter national trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that if Brexit becomes a reality without a contract, what car manufacturers say is a risk of being a priority.
The Toyota production line is based on the reception at the last moment, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both the UK and the EU stores for cars produced after ordering.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a contract on 29 March, it could become an obstacle to the border that the industry thinks might lead to a delay and a lack of participation.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than its daily stock in its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Theresu May Chequers programme for future relations with the EU was "suggested specifically to prevent these border-side views."
"We must have a deal, we want the best deal that will enable us to enjoy not only success in today's world, but as an opportunity that we can use," he said on radio on BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, shows that we must be able to continue in a very effective way.
Toyota could not tell you how long their production would stop, but it warned that for a longer time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost it.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a confidant of the trade union in the factory, said that his associates are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU. ”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein might be postponed again, according to the White House.
On Sunday, the White House declared that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the deputy prosecutor of the state, could be “dispatched again in one week ” now is the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s appointed judge.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller’s work, a special prosecutor who investigates Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia’s assistants, and possible obstacles to the progress of the President’s justice.
For weeks stories have gone to Washington about whether Trump will run assistant prosecutors, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about carrying video recorders to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of flipping the president off by using the 25th paragraph of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, including news that he was going to resign.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said “not at all ” to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he was not at the same time as the hearing of the judicial committee of the Senate, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long study by the FBI on the accusations against Kavanaugh, who postponed the Senate's vote further.
Sarah Sander, the media representative of Trump, was on the show on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It hasn’t been decided the date for him, it could be this week, and I think it might be postponed for another week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we see and it is always my pleasure to inform the media."
Some journalists disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Contributor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction with TV newsmen having “presence, ” but she said:“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have vision. ”
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
"The President answers more questions from the media than any other President has done before," she said, without referring to the source, "We have crossed these figures."
A news conference will continue, said Sanders, but “if the media have the opportunity to ask the president directly of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of that and you've seen us do a lot of that in the past few weeks and it will replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or public meetings with other leaders who visit him.
There are rare media meetings with him alone.
Perhaps this week the president showed why in New York, when he showed unrestrained and strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff in the health system in Scotland for the benefit of Brexit
The Health Commissioner has written staff from the EU working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express the country’s gratitude and wish that it will continue to work after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the cost of job registration applications for EU citizens working within the public service sector.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, discussions between Britain and the EU on the basis of selection continue and are expected to take place in the autumn.
The British government has also worked to prepare if there is no agreement.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the work of all the employees, regardless of their nationality.
EU and other partners provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health services and benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we want you to stay here very much."
Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury in 31-27 losses against Vanderbilt Commodore's team on Saturday, according to Mike Organ's reporter Tennessean.
Rod Reed, director of Tennessee State, told the reporters that the trauma had been a little bit too soon.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," said Reed.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on the stretcher and carried out for a closer look.
An agent from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, WSMV radio operator in Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie had been hospitalized at Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the impact yet ” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in school last year, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five chicks all on Saturday before he left, who raised his total number of bitches up to 18.
Foreign buyers will be rocked by higher stamping fees when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be lost by higher stamping fees when buying real estate in the UK. The excess will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plan of the
The action will make no success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamping fees will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
Government funds are estimated to earn 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be rocked by higher stamping fees when buying real estate in Britain. The excess will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
It will be considered an attempt to put an end to Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising accommodations at a more affordable price and taxing more.
People and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain need to pay higher stamping fees, and the excess will go into government operations to help the homeless.
The increase - which is added to the current stamp fees, including the increase that was made two years ago in an extra house and a real estate purchase for rent - could be up to three percent.
Government funds estimate that the increase will generate up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s constructions are bought by foreign parties, resulting in price increases and making it harder for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become “dark towns ” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
A new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamping fees to help more young people get their first home.
He accused a large construction company of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using them, and urged May to stop hoarding homes on a resilient condition to fix Britain’s “household store. ”
Mr Corbyn has reported a number of significant improvements in housing, including rent control and non-injurious removal of rents.
He also wants to give more authority to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream during my first period - that each new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our unprofitable real estate market.
The door of Britain will always open those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for foreign people as a foreign - based company to buy homes and for wealthy British citizens.
For many, the dream of their own home is far too far off, and the shame of their homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to train Scotland"
Professor Jack Ross, Sunderland, says that it is his “whole goal ” to become a coach at some point in Scotland.
This 42-year-old Scotsman now enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East club, which is now in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish prime department during the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I got hurt on my knees and so it was finished," said Ross in interview with the Sports Sound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland often in Hampden with my father, as a child, and there is always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only happen if I successfully train the department."
The predecessors of Ross as trainers include Dick Advocatet, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said he did not feel any fear of following in the footsteps of so famous names at such a big club as he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As at present, I will speak of my success by thinking, “Can I bring this club back to the high school?”
This club is definitely at home in the high school because of its structure and situation," he said.
"It's not easy to get him there, but I would probably only consider myself a success here if I came back up there to the club."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach after a period of assistant coaching at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a training staff for Hearts.
He helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and changed St Mirren, who was about to fall into a division, into the next division championship.
Ross says he's more confident now than he was ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“ These were probably a real time scene, ” he says of the period when he became coach of Alloa.
“ So I really believed that the coaching work was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I did well, I had a decent income of it, and I enjoyed a modest success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I am still going through it with the stress and pressure of the job, but the coaching work seems simply right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do it, I've never felt better with myself in all my adult years."

The best time for beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to the poll.
The temperature monitoring in summer has been beneficial for British bar that has a bark, but has increased the pressure on restaurants.
Pubbies and stock sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant sales decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the business adviser CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern and June, when barsals increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pubbies and bars, mainly on the drinking market, were the best ones to cope with more upsurges during the downswing of restaurants.
Food sellers also found it difficult in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems people just wanted to go out to drink.
Pub and stock exchange sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, but food sales decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the RSM analysis company, said: “These results continue on the swing we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social events or sports events are still the major factors in the promotion of outdoor markets.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in trouble, even though a reduction in sales of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painfully high on continued cost pressure.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for restaurants and only time will reveal whether to temper the temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the pace of openings.

Each of the five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
Each of the five children, down to the age of 11, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to research results.
Surveys of 20,000 students showed an increase in the “ Gervi Insta” pages
The news has heightened concern about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students claim to have a “primary” account that they show parents
One out of five children, down to the age of 11, make secret accounts of social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in Insta’s productivity - a reference to Instagram’s website.
The news has heightened concern about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “principal” account to show parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on a secret website of her 13 - year - old daughter, found a teenager who encouraged others to “encourage me. ”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and private school principal (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two bills and half of them admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many youths are tempted to create sites online where parents and teachers can’t find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics sports committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as chairman of the Scottish Athletics Committee for the Annual General Meeting of the Government.
Doyle, Scotland’s most successful free - sports team, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said that the appointment was an excellent opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive experience in international affairs in the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect within the sports community in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money for her on the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am keenly interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hoping that I can contribute to helping to continue the sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the 200 - meter [200 m] and 400 - meter [400 m] race at the 1996 Atlantic Olympics, had a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now a regular BBC guest, was paralysed after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “In one month, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell whether I liked it or how much.
It’s been hard work, but I used to get drunk, learned to walk again, and practice sports today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!"
Breast-pump adnotation, which compares mothers to cows, causes a dissection of the Internet
An enterprise that produces a breast pump is now referred to on the Internet as a result of advertisements involving lactating mothers to pregnant cows.
The company Elvie published a nutshell advertisement to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be carried out. ” The advertisement is inspired by music videos and is intended to show the freedom of mothers who are breast - feeding by the new pump.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cow with lyrics such as, "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail on me" and, "If you didn't notice it, it's not a yoke, it's my breasts."
The supplement continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump the milk out of Christmas. ”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has led to an online consultation.
The video has 77,000 viewers and hundreds of commentaries and has received a different response from viewers, many of whom say that it is accompanied by the “wrong ” part of the dairy industry.
“ A really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they have to be calves and carry to produce milk, except what the calves are taken away from them just a few days after they are born," said one of the references.
Elvie’s breast pump fits comfortably into the feeding device (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “Surely difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of time. ”
Others came to protect the advertisement, and one woman admitted that the song was “the first. ”
“ I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping my milk.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took her as she is.
It's a genius," wrote one of the audiences.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is directed to mothers pumping milk (often at work or in a toilet) and feels like a “cheek. ”
This is not a commercial that commends or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their chests.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say they feel like cows pumping milk.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wire or ducts and fits comfortably into the chest strap, giving women the freedom to move, hold their child, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a companion and director at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that it deserved a prominent presentation that would trigger a discussion.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to direct the cast light to the breast pumping and all her challenges, showing even in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has ever heard the news.
On the fashion week in London, two children’s mother presented a fashion show for the designer, Martha Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants quietly moved to a camp near the border of Texas
The number of immigrants in custody has increased suddenly even though the number of people crossing the border has remained somewhat the same monthly, and the reason is that hard talk and policy developed by Trump’s government has made it harder to bring the children into a temporary embryo.
Generally, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and they have been afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country by offering themselves to give birth to a child.
The risk increased in June when the public authorities reported that potential foster parents and other adults in the home would have to make fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, the head of the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed before the Senate and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who applied for the abortion of single children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either a parent or a parent’s home are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
"Therefore, we continue to look for them," said Mr Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the child’s affairs, representatives announced new rules requiring some children to appear in the courtroom within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days of the former rule, according to employees working in the workplace.
Many of them will come through videoconfidence, rather than in person, to reason on their legal position before judges in immigration matters.
The children judged unfit for entry into the country are sent quickly out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or escape attempts, according to the employees of the shelters and reports published by the system in recent months.
The speakers said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution, such as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child is having a difficult time because of the number of them.
So they added that the transfer of children to the camp without giving sufficient time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could increase the shock that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria tells the United States, France, and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Mr Walid al-Moualem, Foreign Minister, also said in his speech to the General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the council.
Moualem firmly argued that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred struggle until we cleanse all Syrian territories“ of both terrorist groups and“ all illegal foreign parties. ”
The United States has some 2000 troops in Syria, where most of them train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the situation was good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western lands ” to“ spread unreasoning fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on international society and human society to facilitate their return, ” he said.
"They make politics out of something that should only be humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not grant any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S.E.D. says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area at the last major fortress of the resistance created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The treaty between Russia and Turkey prevented a great deal of attack by Syrian troops from being strengthened by Russia, on the region of three million people.
On the other hand, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “an obvious final time” and expressed the hope that military operations would be turned into jihadists, including fighters from Nusra Front who are associated with Al-Qaeda, and that “they would be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, Secretary of State, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition, to prepare a constitution for Syria after the war and to pay the road for election.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, and said that her work should be limited to “passing over the rules of the present government, ” warning all interventions.
Reasons why Trump will win another election period
According to that argument, Mr Trump would win the re-elections by 2020, unless charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberals are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of Presidential action ever! ”
As you can see, there's no fatigue.
As of 2014, at best time, an audience of more than double up to 1.05 million CNN, almost tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the section MSNBC, The Rachel Maddow Show, has peaked with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, head of ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama about a member of the government who will be president after the concentration camp is destroyed.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Fair Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, is a different estimate.
She remembers a trip to a Boston taxi for the 2016 election.
The cab manager told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Miss Scovell to me.
It's a fun show in the mess.
Unlike television, however, reports from Washington may determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether families of immigrants can unite with the health of the international economy.
Only those audiences who enjoy what is most privileged can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at the sixth time on a group of experts to reason on the use of Bob Woodwards on the monkey-close sources for his book “Fear, ” or $15,000 of a ostrich jacket that Paul Manafort was wearing (“a thing born with pride,” said Washington Post) and the consequences of the precise biological descriptions of Mr. Trump’s Stormy Daniel.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again.
"The part of what he does makes you feel like a reality factor is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the components 'Pawn Stars', discussing the workforce in Trump's show and daily changes in history (e.g. to launch a fight with N.F.L. and praise for Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one thing, or you'll lose your mind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of heat and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed inside and watched MSNB while he took up CNN.
He could not get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to witness before the Court Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out people were right."

Money Beyond Flow in the Nearest Circumstances
It is not surprising that the 17th region of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing, thanks to reorganization in areas that led two representatives to compete for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends out the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his second place in a special election last summer.
Lamb invites another representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is very close to the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old regions were organized for the benefit of the Republicans and that they were breaking the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district has begun to compete in the campaign funding between the major funders of both classes, the Democratic Committee (DCCC) and the Committee of the Republics (NRCC).
Lamb became well - known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a special election in March prior to the 18th precinct in Pennsylvania, many of which followed that election.
The Republicans had previously warmed it for over a decade, and the president, Donald Trump, had won the 20 - grade victory.
Political experts have given a little advance to democrats.
The United States thought about punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then stopped.
Government dragons noted that the Dominican republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with small protests from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a Panamanian hotel until Trump’s co-owners ran the board of directors.
Representatives of the Foreign Affairs Council decided to call back the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “a recent decision not to accept Mr. Tævan no longer,” said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the government statement early this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received USD 140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug control, development work and economic support.
The sanctions imposed, including a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the release of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where high unemployment and mortality rates are high.
As the indoor meetings continued, the U.S. and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year and considered to be a step forward in measures to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, by mid - September, representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the convention to be presented, and as a result, they ended up in all illegitimate punishments against El Salvador.
Mr. Mike Pence, Vice President, will now address the conference, to be held in the middle of October, as a symbol of the importance it has in the eyes of the government, said the exorcisms.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard message or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the discussion that the three U.S. representatives described, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the inner - house discussions against being anonymous.
Their description was confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter of anonymity.

The next scandal may be the report by Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, on the possible measures by Mr Trump to prevent justice, but there are numerous official evidence for that charge.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller will also turn his research to see whether Mr. Trump's campaign of election worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the council is controlled by another class, Trump may have to bear responsibility for it, at the time when he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps the abstinence of his appointed peers.
This is very uncertain, however, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is indisputable or that his colleague is in Europe.
All of us need to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to rob Hitler, only if Western countries had given him resistance and support from the Czechoslovakian people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of distress that followed.
History revolves around such important points and speeds up or slows down the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing some of such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Rod Rosenstein State Attorney, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he suggested making secret recordings of the president and arguing whether he was incompetent in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI study on Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court’s seat despite religious accusations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the assembly during the mid-term, which will make Mr Trump shoulder responsibility?
If we fall into these trials, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that used to sit in my ambassador’s home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to turn on Sabbath candles on the table with the rooster.
With such an inheritance, how can I but look to our future in a positive way?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers officer, bright eye for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians will bring them in a strong position to emerge from the G-group of the European Union. Rangers made a magnificent equal participation in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented the middleman Graham Dorrans from playing his first game at the season before in the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2-2 tie, but he believes that Rangers can use the results as a jumpboard for better success.
"It was good to get this point for us, for Villarreal is a strong team," said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could reach something and end up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but on the whole, a fair outcome was likely equal.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got strong into the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important evening for the European Union.
I hope we can reach three points, but it will be difficult, as they did well in their last game, but with those who support us, I am sure that we did this and get positive results.
The last year was difficult, both because of my injury and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the area.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
I hope we can make it further now, set the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing their pension savings
Although the poll participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
About half the subjects in the National Survey said that they discussed with their mate the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they were discussing this with their children.
"People want a family member to care for it, but it's not taking the right steps to have them conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of National Life Security.
Here's the deal.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes clear with good warning.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and when you are cared for, for these options can change much in terms of cost.
Include your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find ways to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional long-term life insurance, mixed life insurance that pays to cash, to help pay the cost, or self-confidence with your own money--as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal conflict in advance.
Get a health care professional to name someone whom you trust to supervise your health care and to ensure that your health care professional wishes for you if you are unable to tell them directly by yourself.
Think, too, about getting procurators for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older father or mother is in an emergency and is going to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Provide these information exactly in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about money, but also about who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“ Who are the drugs?
Who will guard the dog?
Get that plan ready."

Earthquakes and Flood Waves in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a powerful earthquake and a flood in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, said representatives, and is expected to speak the dead will rise.
As all communications lie down, relief workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, a region north of Pala, near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 at Richter.
Over 16,000 people were left out of their homes in Pala after the calamity came upon them.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, is located at the base of a narrow flea on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40 - year anniversary when the earthquake and the tide struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 300 miles [380 km] of a beachline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county government had an estimated population of 2,99,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala beach area.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, most of them in Morowali, which is on the coast of Sulawesi.
Flood waves have ravaged Pala and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian disaster organization.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a flood struck and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
Also, in 1996, a flood in the west of Donggala, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the active circle of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh region in the northern part of Sumetra raged on December 26th, causing a flood that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian coast, of which more than half of them were in Aceh.

Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York prosecutors want a death penalty against Sayvollo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the State for crimes against federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have rented a Home Depot truck to attack people on a bike path along the road West Side Highway in the lower Manhattan area. He drove there walking and cycling roadmen in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims eight “willfully” and caused serious physical injury“ intentionally, ” according to the declaration of will to use the death penalty recorded in the South District Judgment in New York.
Both of these prosecutors can lead to a possible death penalty, according to the legal document.
Many weeks after the attack, the federal court accused Saipov of 22 teams, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, usually used by prosecutors in criminal proceedings against organized criminal organizations, and Saipov was also charged with violent crime and for destroying cars.
The attack included “a number of planned plans, ” the accusers said, describing Sapiov’s actions as“ terrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
"Sayfullo Habiblalevic Saipov was elected to harm, harm and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the wish statement.
Five victims were travelers from Argentina.
A decade ago, New York City, New York City, the last cause of death, was the treatment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were killed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both the couple were killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told investigators that he was doing well with what he had done, said a police officer.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charge.
He also asked to show the flag to ISIS in his hospital room, said a police officer.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders of Saipov, said that they were “disillusioned, of course, ” with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty rather than to accept a declaration of guilt against life imprisonment without the possibility of a parole will only extend the shock to all parties due to this event,” said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to search for a death penalty.
The Congressman says that NIGL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “work the people’s army ” today at the convention of the conservatives.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians had to “feel pressure” from EU skeptics at the same time as one of Theresu May’s members suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
At the Birmingham protest march, conservative Peter Bone said that Britain would now “be gone out ” if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by May to settle a deep dispute between her own staff was even more evident when prisoners who wanted to remain in the EU joined other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is faced with difficulties in keeping his Chequers programme on the right track and is critical of those who are in favour of Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition and force those who are opposed to Brexit and the Workers' Party to choose between its plans and 'disgrace'.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest march in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr. Farage be allowed to participate and assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were with the government, we would have gone out now," he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone referred to indications that public opinion had changed since the 2016 elections: “The idea that British public opinion has changed its mind and wants to stay is completely untrue. ”
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, was also on the protest and told the reporters: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public, and opposition will not vote with it, and it will benefit from the unpopularness of our fellow class and assailants who are on the streets and vote for us.
Please, stop the Chequers program and start listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep the job when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to “feel pressure ” if they were to compromise the decision taken after the 2016 vote.
“ This is about trust between our people and our political party, ” he said.
"They want to try to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you get away with this."
He added in his messages to the crowd: “I want you to put pressure on your political team, who are failing Brexit.
We are active forces of the public in this country that have given us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest conference in the city centre.
A small group of campaigners waved flags of prisoners against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the working class, made a joke about the security problems of the group’s phone program when the convention was opened.
He added: “These are the people who tell us that they can keep all computer systems in order and all technology for Canada plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders. ”
“ This is a scandal.
There's nothing to call good Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to “consider seriously ” to invite himself to the president’s office.
Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator, claims that after the November elections, “he intends to consider a serious proposal to the president’s office. ”
A report from Boston Globe says that the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about its future at a civil meeting in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized President Donald Trump of the United States, offers himself a re-election in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been the focal point of the ingenuity that it could offer itself against Trump by 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke's afternoon, on Saturday, was a 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with its inhabitants in the district, since Trump took office.
One attender asked her if she intended to invite herself to the president.
Warren replied that it would be time for “women to go to Washington and organize our government, and then a woman to lead. ”
Arrested after a fatal shooting at Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reported on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported a arrest on Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a person who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near Southern University's university area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims had a bullet wound in his head and died because of it," said Sheriff Murphy J. Paul at the press on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wayde came to his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been on the scene, with weapons in his departure, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained in the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two metres tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, 10 of them in the first season and played on average 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and reached 2.9 episodes in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat by order from their team.
It was evident from the fact that Valtteri Bottas had a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton at the start of Saturday, that orders from the Mercedes team would play a large party in the race.
Bottas got a good start at the start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight his teammates.
Vettel went first into the pit and left Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been able to manage the results.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged from a close fight where driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inside side after having had the risk of remaining, after defense attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started back in the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first cycle, on his 21 - year birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he delayed changing tires to try to finish quickly and pass through Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally went into the pit for a 44th ring but could not increase the speed of the eight rings remaining, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri stood on his feet all weekend, and was a true gentleman running me past.
The team has stood wonderfully to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because of her claim that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accused of Brett Kavanaugh, a high court judge, about a sexual affair.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly of the testimony of Ford to the Committee of the Selections of the Senate. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untrue. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and cruel and untrue, ” he said.
“ When you see the publications and leaks and then they say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you read this?
Do you remember her answer... do you read the document?
Oh, no.
I won't read it."
Wait a minute.
No, we're not laughing,' he said, and he imitated the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges from Ford against Kavanaugh appeared, which was leaked early in September, and Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't read her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to the report from The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it in fidelity and I did as she asked me to."
But her denial did not seem to go well down in the president’s office, who said at Saturday’s meeting: “I’ll tell you that, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she won't leak anything, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual violence by three women, and suggested that democrats take advantage of the accusations themselves.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods they may use.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to choose to gain power and control," said the president, according to the news from Mediaite.
Elite League Division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two limits for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars added their losses on Friday in the Elite League Division against Belfast Giants, by winning the next game after, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got an early two-point advance from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie rallied for the locals, but Dwyer came over Giants again.
Francois Bouchard, in turn, obtained the victory of Dundee and two bounds from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
That was the third loss in the season for the team Adam Keefe in the Elite League department, which had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
That was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute when the clock showed 3.35, after Kendall McFaulll’s support. David Rutherford then came with support when Beauvilier doubled the advance four minutes later.

A pilot gives life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a major earthquake over the island of Sulawesi on Friday followed by a tidal wave.
Large aftershocks continue to roam the area, and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Pala.
The 21 - year - old Anthony Gifferan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the control tower, which was most often at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Pala.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air’s aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake hit, could surely be airborne.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision saved hundreds of lives, as reported in ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“ We are very sad to hear this, ” he added.
The authorities fear that the number of the dead could exceed a thousand, when the disaster agency of the country says that access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of dead people is expected to increase, as many dead bodies are still under destruction and can't be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Institute.
Up to six feet [6 m] of high waves have caused a tremendous destruction in Pala, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
The army and passenger planes are working on providing relief and supplies.
In an interview with Sky News, a 35 - year - old mother named Risa Kusuma said: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little about clean water.
The small markets have been plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to find survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia, came to Pala on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said in CNN's news.
Earlier this year, earthquakes swept across Lombok, Indonesia, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that the same thing is missing after a plane crashed into the loon
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a loan in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that from the afternoon on Saturday it did not know about the end of one male passenger.
The airline said that it was working with the authorities in the area, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and the precise sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed in the loon a short distance ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the flight had been extremely low.
"That was really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could water the waist - deep water and find emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were afraid and screaming and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen who were working a little late to build a dock also helped the rescue by using an inflated boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about a hundred feet [30 m] of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in the flight accidents of the PNG-registered aircraft fleet in the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
One expert describes the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutors closed their case in a resumption of a case against a man accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a U.S. judicial expert, spent many hours in the courtroom as a specialist in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the magistrate how he used cell - phone records to pool the journeys of the defendant, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and 19 - year - old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, across his earlier claims, according to the report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from his phone.
"He destroyed her from his life," said Hale.
It is estimated that on Sunday the defenders will make their final talk.
The judge said that he expected the matter to be brought before the abdominal office later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop jump?
The hip hop triangle wants to fight negative views of the music by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hops were removed from their origin, containing political messages and discussing community issues.
They want to look back at the origin and make conscious hip hops popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent boom in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny's New York Nanny is suing a couple for an outburst of "prejudiced" text message
In New York’s country, a couple prosecuted for illegal expulsion after having received an unwarranted text message from her mother, complaining that she was “other black people. ”
So the couple refuse to be prejudiced and liken the prosecution to “fornication. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she found out that her new baby, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Ms. Maurice.
After discovering their mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman, Ms. Maurice, found out that their former black cousins had behaved badly, and that she had expected to receive a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post report.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants to be reimbursed for the outburst, that the amount of $350 a day for the six-month job to which she had originally been hired, even if no contract had been signed.
"I wanted to show them that you shouldn't do this," she said in her interview with Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is a difference."
The couple objected to the accusation that they were prejudiced and said that it was right to fire Maurice, who felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her a message that she didn’t want to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children in someone after having shown rudeness to them, even if they were surprised?
His newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened the prosecution to “terrorism,” saying that his wife had come seven months on the way and was in “very difficult situations. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very nice done," said Plasco, who works in the investment company.
The matter is still before the court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on social media and has shamed them for their conduct and reasoning.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new message.
Regarding the letter, Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said: “It’s hard to get in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"That's very funny now that we know of the enormous success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked at the BBC as a cameraman before he was inspired to write a children’s book on a small toy bear, had taken away her work with a shaky positive attitude, adding that the 60 - birthday edition of the book was “loving ” after his death last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as “a vital family member, ” she added that her father had shown silent pride in his success in the end.
"He was a very quiet man and not used to brag," she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a person having a child who does something, and you’re proud of it even if you haven’t really done anything yourself.
I think he'd actually looked at Paddington's success that way.
Though Paddington was creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honour of himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she arrived, her daughter had been transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
"Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was extremely bad, that she was not expected to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart up were gradually losing their activity and being eliminated from her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn’t glow or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
"No one knew anything," she said.
“ I killed my head, and my tears fell all along.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt great sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a message on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and commit suicide when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old, lived in Lydney and said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he was “sucked down in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after his own life.
Says Ms. Davis: “I am constantly worried that it will be a result of it. ”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that they can go and talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit and say nothing--you have to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphrey, a friend of Ms. Davies ’ years, lost her mate, Mark, to 15 years of age, shortly after his mother died.
She said, "He didn't say anything about his suffering or being depressed or anything like that.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a real shock to them, but they had to work out: “It breaks a hole in the family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we must continue to fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on a thread when the FBI has its investigation
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study with limited time and scope - maybe we could reach a little agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "going apart" in the middle of a dispute between the classes where everything was in a backdoor.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Federation want the FBI to investigate?
Their loyalty is due to the timing.
In just five weeks, on November 6, the Middle Ages are in decline, and if the Republicans fail, as they are expected, their serious efforts to get their own man elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the land are weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was the secretary Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its study report?
A vote will be taken at the General Assembly, where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats will sit at the present time.
It is not yet certain that Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would enable Vice President Mike Pence to break up the counter and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court.
Number of people fleeing North Korea "reduces" under Kim
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has diminished since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to the Congressman of South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from the South Korea Association Council, saying that 1127 people had fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border alerts between North Korea and China and higher charges of smuggling with people are key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official declaration.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive the South Korean Civil Rights.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 people from North Korea have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border that lies to North Korea, and it is easier to cross it than the well-attended area between North and South Korea.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Technically speaking, communications between North and South Korea have improved considerably over the past month.
Earlier in this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that mainly focused on delayed nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they roughly agreed to work together towards a nuclear-free Korean.
On Saturday, however, Mr. Ri Yong Ho, Secretary of State of North Korea, taught the American clientele about the lack of progress since then.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons alone first, ” said Ri in his speech at the U.S. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "motherly disease" and says he is incapable of performing the duties of Supreme Court judge.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in Congress, called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court “Motherly Sick” and said that he was overly empathetic in order to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi dropped those words on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease, ” said Pelosi of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied with great emotion the accusations that he had harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes crying out and getting cakes in his throat when he talked about his family and his school years.
Also, he publicly condemned the Democratic Party of the Committee and called the accusations of “a vicious and organized murder ” organized by liberals who were angry at the loss of the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work at the Supreme Court, for he showed partiality to democrats.
"I think that these claims and how he attacked the Clinton and Democratic men show that he is incompetent for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not answer when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh out of work if he was confirmed and if the Democrats got the majority in Congress.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, then he's not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now serving as a judge in the court of appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion laws of Roe v. Wade, where he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned to questions as to whether he would turn the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"This is no time for a motherly, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, "It's wonderful."
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is just speech, months, and years of rage, and it does not come from itself without weeping.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, but you?"
She continued, “I received a lot of help from a woman who was the manager of a place where she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and began to cry, she said to her neighbor,“ You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permitted to express partial anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories of my previous job, which I did in an office with men in the majority, where I started to cry with rage that I couldn’t express, came an older woman and took on my neck-drap. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a little and she dragged me into the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're pissed off.
They think you're sad and happy to have reached you."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was in a presidential performance, but she was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a deluge on a boat in the name of Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his proposal, Ms. Schroeder, felt full resentment, that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“ It wasn’t a well - thought - out decision, ” she said laughing at me, 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named this name "The White Mell and the Seven Dwarves."
As far back as the campaign was concerned, she was left with funding, so she promised not to volunteer unless she could collect $2 million.
There was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“ Do they think I’m getting a discount? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally offer herself, she was so overwhelmed by emotion--thank you to the people who had supported her, resentment toward the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct her eyes to electors instead of representatives, and anger out into the gender difference--that she burst into tears.
“ I might think I had a nervous breakdown, ” said Ms. Schroeder, remembering how the media reacted.
“ It could be thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my uterine?
"She cried?"
Circumstances that business wars between the United States and China could be beneficial for Beijing
The first blows in the business war between the United States and China were devastating, and even though the war is far from over, there may be a long - term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s major export products, including solar cells, steel, and aluminium.
This week’s greatest stagnation came with new customs to cover goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded to the same coin each time and recently put 5 to 10 percent tax on American goods at $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to United States customs controls, and it is unlikely that another of the world’s largest economies will soon be released.
To get Washington to jump, it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to turn publicly from the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing keeps its cards correctly, pressure from the business war with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a long time, reducing the mutual need for both systems for each other.
“The fact that a political decision has been taken quickly either in Washington or Beijing could lead to situations leading to economic collapse in one country is, in fact, far more dangerous than the audience has previously admitted, ” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses primarily on Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria “prepared” for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the land, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Mr. Walid al Moualem, Foreign Minister of the United Nations General Assembly, said that conditions in the country were improving.
“ Today, the situation on the earth is more stable and secure, thanks to its success in the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to develop normal conditions by building up areas destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return to the land they were forced to leave for terrorism and the one - side economic decisions that were directed against their daily lives and jobs.
THE estimate is that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more still living in the land need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept aid from conditions or from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States with the final score of 16.5 at 10.5 points in the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cups in Europe since 1993.
Once again, Europe, under the leadership of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had the greatest difficulty in the race, struck his initial blow into the 16th hole water, which is par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the 50-0 results, since the race began to use its current format in 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spieth lost 5 / 4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was in the lowest position in the ranks of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who played possibly in his final race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times around the Ryder Cup, became the winner of the 25.5 - career European race.
“ Most of all, I’m not crying, but today I can’t do anything else.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," said the emotional garcia after the victory of Europe.
He handed his country to John Rahm, but he defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now recorded with 13-21-3 in the race for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding themselves on the field all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game through the entire race.
“ I am proud of them, ” said U.S. president Jim Furyk, after disappointment with their team’s performance.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'm taking Thomas down.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together. I'll work with PGA in the United States. I'll call Ryder the Cup. And we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and I am proud to be their leader.
You have to take it from above.
They played better than we did."
