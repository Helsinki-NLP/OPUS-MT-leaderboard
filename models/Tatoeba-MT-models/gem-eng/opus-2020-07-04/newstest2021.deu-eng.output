At the collision hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to dodge the car, but it was still at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the stripping process, the hand lever and foot brake lever were ripped off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
At the moment of his mind he steered his motorcycle into the green stiffs next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling into the trap.
Biker Suffers Bone injury
However, because of the collision with the car, the bikers suffered an injury at the Bem and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a Corona massage infection on a large vegetable farm in the lower Bavaria Mamming, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service oversees the aviary.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positively on the Corona sarco-coV-2 during the series investigation, as the Dingolfing Landau County Council announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we need to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for inserters.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of over 3,300 people not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of persons".
Infected in the farm were separated by non-infected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPDs gave the government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of temporary workers' accommodation.
"It can be bitter if such local infection events are to take place and regional lockdowns are to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, Parliamentary Director of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already requested a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, hygiene conditions at work and living conditions must be strictly controlled.
This has obviously not happened".
The outbreak had come "with annoyance".

Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage data storage
Stock data storage is currently suspended.
However, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer requests an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
After a media report, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data - instead of the planned 10 weeks, six months.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer, Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a rapid change of law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He thinks it makes sense "to make necessary adjustments in the law now" the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently stock data storage is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected to be taken.
But Seehofer wants the changes already before, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, it goes on in the report.
A spokesman of the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be useful to examine whether legal adjustments are needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already expressed support for stock data storage in June.
NBA: Strip club Ärger for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Excited in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the Disney World tournament quarter with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he went to the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted the visit according to ESPN specifications, is back in Isloation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Ann. d. R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that NBA Williams had ordered a ten-day quarantine.
In this way, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
At present, the best 22 teams are preparing with training games for the season finals that begin on Friday at night.
South expresses itself after mass infection to the corona layer
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a teaspoon for large farms.
The press conference will be on our homepage live.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing Landau district has alarmed authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have been infected with the corona pathogens.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the site, food is supplied.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the more than 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
As the harvesters had little contact with the local population, so far the County Council has assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Knowledges": Conscientious confession by Nantes' alleged firecracker
"My client showed himself cooperatively," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He very much regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "pained by pangs of conscience and taken with great care the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, the man, according to the prosecutor's office, threatens ten years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been badly damaged during a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out in three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of fire foundation.
The now detained suspect had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent invasion into the church, he quickly came into the eyes of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," Grindel said on "Photo on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules, however, do not work for the associations that can become the most dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is not appropriate to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into these Phalanx".
However, he has doubts as to whether the German Football League would be prepared to allow majority participations prohibited by the 50+1 rules in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk to attract investment fences around the Bundesliga economic location in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former Head of the DFB sees the danger that "the attempts to achieve a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million", said the 58-year-old.
With a view of the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and passed through to the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've been very busy with that in my life."
He had received the gift worth about 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I handled completely transparent and harmless.
Many of them knew about it in the DFB".
He never "made a heel out of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"That may be called naive, in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the great party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale are burning, Rakoczy ball or fortification, so many of the Corona-compliant alternative program came at their expense.
"I think we managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Cur Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would've taken it well.
In principle, they returned to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, and only the historians were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watching the historians strolling and listening to Cuban live music at the playground restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," said Konhäuser.
She misses the masses of people that are otherwise part of Rakoczy.
However, she lacks the usual program highlights, first and foremost Saale burns on Friday evenings, as well as the historic fortress and the closing fireworks on Sunday evenings.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have gone super well this year," she says.
Rakoczy Tournament will take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program was partly more work.
For Christina Gold, who participates in a normal year at the fortress and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was traveling on Saturdays and Sundays in costume on foot in the city.
"That's more strenuous, or we'll have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the Reiterquadille will be allowed to take place again next year," says Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021 a Rakoczy tournament will take place again.
28 Corona cases in the Spanish branch Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football player CF Fuenlabrada wears out because of a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid, despite the first Corona Falls on July 20th, has flown to the city of A Coruña, a low tide follows the next one.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.

Neither was it good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, announced that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The charge of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club attorney Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca", has not been breached by the Corona rules set up by the football association.
Before the departure, there were four infected persons until July 19, who were all isolated and not co-operated.

When the team was already in A Coruña, then "five or six" other team members of the Corona test were positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the whistle, Tebas Llanas said.

Radprofi Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just laying down the conditions with the team, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".

Argentina rejects the creditor's counter offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced on Saturday in Buenos Aires.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer viable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina calls on its private creditors to waive some of its claims of approximately $66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is once again threatening the state pit.
It would be the ninth payment failure in Argentinian history.
Finally, the creditors had requested higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government is holding to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is experiencing a severe financial and economic crisis.
The rate of inflation was more than 50 percent last.
For the current year, experts expect a decline of about 10 percent in economic power.
At the end of May, Argentina had not satisfied interest receivables of USD 503 million and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Professionally arrived - private not yet
"It's going great" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will take up the successor of Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelder Notariatstelle.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctorate lawyer took up the work, the normal day business is long on full tours.
"I must, however, arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottalan ad and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time has not been enough to shift the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently with her husband, who is serving as judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave in the short term in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, they sometimes also have an overnight stay with their parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighborhood, the town of Eggenfelden has, of course, long been a term.
When visiting on-site with her family in the past few months, she has recently noted: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
All the more so she was pleased that she had done the race in the competition for the free position.
She also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career in Lower Bavaria: after her law degree in Passau, she completed her term of reference and the second state degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also trained "next to" the promotion in labour law - she took her first position in 2012 as notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016, she moved to Regensburg in her parents' time, and eventually moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notaries.
The 39-year-old explains that when the job was in Eggenfelden because of Lutz Feller's immediate retirement, it had come to see the right time for full professional reintegration.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday office at the Notariatstelle, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has just praised the firm's team: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the forthcoming relocation of the private food point.
In Kindergarten and Krippenplaats she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to get to know her hobby soon too - and get to know the most beautiful jogging areas of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the case of a fan return.
"Because of the distance control that must be complied with, we are planning, according to the current stand, with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer.
Normally, the Arena in the Revierstadt in Bundesliga plays has a bit more than 81,000 viewers.
In the ghost games of the last season caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB per game had been lost about four million euros.
Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal viewer places, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened: "Of course, it is a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all "good advice to take a stable side long for the first time" is currently being given.
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are working short-term in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," said Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing CEO praised the BVB-Profi for their salary share waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary loss has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work".
Little wonder: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packer's butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his whole body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 mornings that are taken care of at the Graz children's clinic every year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even one kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Her skin is sometimes so delicate that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini-windles for them.
But not so small that they weren't in voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if they don't scream quite as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage still experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production of "The Home Dress" to the students via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to share the piece and performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted to learn.
Even though at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional charms, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game business," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: the TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal

De Havilland was well-known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South-State Epos "From Winde wäht" (1939).
When a child of British parents was born in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland was still a grandchild in California.
The Austrian theatreman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers signed it for seven years and brought it out big at the side of Erol Flynn.
Eight films shot her with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the main role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Motherherz".
Three years later the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (Die Erbin).
A lot of recognition has also been given to her as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Serpent".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her as the main role in the filming of her novel "My cousin Rachel".
The play has been a worldwide success.
With her long-standing friend Bette Davis she played in "Wiedenlied for a Body".
==Early life==The son of Benjamin emerged from his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953).
In Paris de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage, too, broke.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have, however, never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
The second World Championships Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf in the semi-finals, Nils Ehlers and Lars Fluggen submitted their national team colleagues with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler had last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final play on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/flygen crested against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21) a defeat.
In addition to the show tournament, three starting points for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand in early September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz-Rauschurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a " fig leaf" and does not change anything about the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," said FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiation, the AfD’s Bundesschiedsgericht confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which had been decided by the Federal Executive Board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, functionalists such as Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing," he said the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters still have a right extreme in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again end below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AFD in Parliament are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "flies" around the Thuringian AfD-Landes- and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection is a "secure right-wing extremist attack".
In May, the AfD Federal Chief of Staff had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz did not mention an earlier membership at his party entry in the now prohibited right extreme "Heimattreien Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left division in Brandenburg's Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesschiedsgericht did not alter the character of the AfD: "The wolf only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extreme party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither will this decision weaken the Federal Party nor the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
One wants to avoid further observation through constitutional protection and tries to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD won't let go of the spirits she called.
A rouswurf doesn't change anything yet," commented Brandenburg's SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD Landesverband and the group held to their right leaders until today".
The legal dispute surrounding the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday, he announced that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of 11,51 Terawatt hours of electricity, the wind turbines on the German North Sea fed into the grid.
This is a good 21 percent higher than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea power to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the grid area of Tennet, have fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, the wind flow from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due to higher production capacity in addition to wind conditions, as new wind farms have been on the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we have so far invested 20 billion euros in expanding offshore network connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
This year's record day is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power stations.
Almost seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the Galerie des Gmünder Kunstvereins.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration to 130.
Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by Leipzig's artist Christian Bold exploded the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more artists than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
In the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - conscious of how difficult it is for those involved - hoped for the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partially).
"But ultimately we are here as organisers for the health of many thousand people."
For if tens of thousands had flowed to the fortress and the fortress, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and a follow-up of contact according to the current Corona Protection Regulation could not be complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg delayed next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, including the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympiadger Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the Dressur tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four wins at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start of each season with the beige gold and the Quantaz, it was not to hit the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and in the near future.
At the 15-year-old mare of Weihegold, Werth made a clear opposition to Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Sunday.
On Saturday, too, the Germans were clearly in front of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first chorus ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned for August 14 to 16.
Future more air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University goes further into the air vents: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" creates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the opportunity to not only allow the start of the study in summer, but also for the winter semester.
This enables twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities are equally exploited in both the university and the DFS Air Safety Academy.
The DFS will advise the university in setting up and occupying the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been trained to pilot at the Worms University of Applied Sciences in the Air Traffic Management course.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further enhancing the attractiveness of the piloting profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us.
However, we expect air traffic to recover and to grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of DFS at signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation's Professorship is a forward-looking investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate with the university and at the same time strengthen our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University, emphasises this: "The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it we would like to associate with the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree programme Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German Air Safety Authority was at the same time for the University of Worm's motivation and commitment to further expand their teaching and research competence in the future areas of aviation.
In use for tomorrow's air traffic controllers, the university, with the first foundation professorship for a dual course of study, could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, emphasises: "The Worms University has a unique position in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopters land on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully blocked in the direction of Aschaffenburg on Saturday afternoon, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in operation.
A 76-year-old drove straight on the Alzenau-Mitte exit with a Ford around 12.40 and landed on the guideboard.
Through the impact the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries on the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were provided by the medical doctor and the patient was flown to a hospital following the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about 2000 euros, had to be dragged off.
Heil wants to check other sectors after the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the situation to light again in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will they stay?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the strict rules now planned against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer has already warned against restricting works contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Federal Cabinet on this Wednesday wants to pass a law of salvation.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel in slaughter, decommissioning and meat processing.
This is intended to prohibit the use of contract workers and temporary workers there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said to dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction on works contracts and employee transfer if you don't want to completely choke the economy".
For example, works contracts are the basis for their value added to the customer for large areas of the craft, construction industry and plant construction.
"Individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts were meaningful.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety facility, this is a very normal contract for works".
The German meat industry considers that a ban on works contracts and loan work alone in its sector is unconstitutional.
It should not be explained why in the future, when serving and packaging cheeses, other labour laws are to be applied than in sausages, it is stated in an opinion on the legislative project, as reported by the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
Thus, in the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many East European workers from contract work companies worked in the industry for 16 hours a day following the results of a study by the NRW Employment Protection Administration.
Often they had no break.
Wage has been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But by "tricking constructions" they had been bypassed.
"Now must be thoroughly cleaned up."
The politician announced: "The Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the Cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that not only concern the meat sector - for example, higher labour protection testing rates or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft presented by dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to make even more checks in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, including animal transport," said nunnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg up-to-date".
However, for more controls, more staff are also needed.
Three dead at crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
In the crash of an ultralight aircraft to a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police reports, three people died.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people had been rescued during the accident, said a spokesperson of the Wesel County Council.
A parachute had been found at the crash site, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported in appeal to eyewitnesses that before the crash the plane was collided with a hot air balloon.
At the house it is a one or two family house.
Details were not known at first.
Room of Frankfurter Opernplatz pass peacefully
A week after the outbursts in Frankfurt, the space of the opera court during the night was also peacefully finished on Sunday.
Finally, a few dozen people stayed in the square, but left at 1 o'clock before the start of the lock-up.
Since the early evening, the police had been working with numerous officials, throughout the entire city area a larger police force was to be seen.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a restraining order for the opera court, where there had been a week ago in Krawallen.
Policemen had been attacked out of the crowd of celebrations with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car overcomes: Young woman severely injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal cameras, the fire brigade was looking for potential drivers.
According to the police, the woman was on the road on Bundesstraße 83 towards her hometown of Hümme when her car came off the road from a previously unclear cause and passed over several times.
To save the injured, the fire brigade had to clear the car's roof.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent Maisfeld was picked from the rotary ladder with a thermal camera.
The Drohnensstaffel from Warburg, who also works with thermal cameras, had also been ordered for the search of persons.
However, the forces found no one between the high corn plants.
The injured person was transferred to the hospital in Kassel.
Almost 50 forces of the fire brigade Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was blocked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - The Italian championship has been secured for the ninth time after a rescue gate by Cristiano Ronaldo Juventus Turin.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th scudetto of the club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer out of place one two days before the end of the season.
The table length Inter Milan is down seven points.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half of the time, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free kick-off option.
A addition of Miralem Pjanic directly used a flat shot (45.+7) to the 35-year-old from the penalty room limit.
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0 against the more offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67).
This ensured the smooth but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter shot at the latte in the 89st minute is thought to have been correctly annoyed only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goaljäger evaluation.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the moment changes very easily," Trainer Maurizio Sarri explained after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve had, in the end, also the weakness of the competitors due to the calming advantage at the top of the table.
For in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had succeeded only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become king of goalkeepers is questionable.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile, after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table-fired Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, has already scored 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern's win of the title.
The current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Alte Dame" of Italian football is waiting for the next chance.
Juventus is in the championships League's eighth final, but on 7 August against Olympian Lyon, a 0:1-Hinspielpleite has to compete in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: 250 illegal car races are recorded
Stuttgart - All-embracing penalties and court judgements Despite, drivers continue to give gas to many illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the Southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Comparative values for the years before are not available, but the rases are increasingly working on the judicial authorities: in 2018 the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigations for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The race was less about organized events, as the answer given by the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers would have acted spontaneously against each other or they would have escaped from the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
The tax was mainly for German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 imprisonments
Only in comparatively few cases will the shavers be caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
There is no evidence, however, that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more often, said one minister.
Especially popular with Rasern, the motorway 8. Always stop motorists from there to get some space and use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, and three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstreite"
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempo limit, the shaver is tried to slow down on the particularly affected section between narrow and geishen.
The most highly prized and enjoyed sports and luxury carists often have Swiss characters, because because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country to race to Germany.
For the SPD, the tempo limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 km/h, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD Landtag Group.
"The brake threshold for shavings would be significantly higher if you were not here and there legally with 200 km and more on the move."
Rivoir is less concerned with education or image campaigns: "Whoever puts himself at risk not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users is hardly yet accessible with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police enforcement
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred from the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even harder controls on the routes concerned.
From the high-tour power measure, it is not rare to become more painful and more serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races throughout the country, two of them inadvertent in a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, hit a garden wall and stayed on the side, who died 18-year-old bystander.
Twenty-one more people have been injured during the races over the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, severe penalties are not necessary: "Regulatory action needs to be taken in order to impose more severe sanctions on illegal motor racing," says the Ministry of the Interior.

Ackermann sprints for victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann fought his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer from the Bora-hansgrohe team worked on the 109-kilometre-long section with the start and destination in Hermannstadt in mass print after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the three and four season wins for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger performed.
In the morning, the 26-year-old had decided for himself the mountain time trial and thus took over the top of the classment.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit during mountaineering.
"I am really happy to start the new season with a victory," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
He simply put on his sprint 300 meters in front of the target, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race with all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and attendants were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and destination were not allowed.
Headquarters gave directions for lay-reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday noon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay alive in the water while bathing.
According to the fire brigade, the emergency call went in shortly before 1:00.
"A lead station dissociator gave immediate instructions for lay-reanimation," said a fire-fighter to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took the revival measures a little later.
The child in danger of life was transported under reanimation to the Uniklinik.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police routinely filed the accident investigation.
The firefighter: "We are going out of a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police arrest 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture house on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to monitor such events more closely.
A big tuning meeting was held on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's South City.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police, midfielders had found an increased vehicle attendance in the area of a large parking lot on the Ingolstadter Straße around 10:30 p.m. by the Nuremberg Transport Police.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle controls there.
Only recently had the police announced that they wanted to take a stronger stand against so-called car bags.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "Scene"
The officials numbered well over 700 vehicles and about 1100 persons, the police balanced.
However, only a small part of the "autoposer" and tuning scene should be assigned.
Obviously, the majority of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it should be assumed that these were mostly eye-catching.
In addition, the majority of those present remained in the current anti-infectious provisions, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed by 1:00 a.m.
All in all, the officials found in 10 vehicles such structural changes that the operating permit had been lost.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No Auto Run
Illegal car racing didn't happen.
"The police bureau of Central France will continue to keep an eye on the situation and continue to carry out reinforced control measures, including in the context of the emergence of spectators," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the involved tow company: "They have all the beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," Schrödinger said.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Even because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to do any damage.
"The young people are finally supposed to keep their cars back unharmed."
Number of work agency: 900 cases of maladministration in short-term work
Berlin - The Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) according to its own statement, approximately 900 cases of suspicion of abuse of short-worker money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have shown short-term work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Managing Director of the operating business of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the test lasted up to three weeks.
"That much time was not available to us during this hot phase.
So we're going to look at the finals.
I'm sure there'll be a lot of things left to do.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
Evidence of abuse often came from the employees concerned or from trade unions.
In addition, use BA analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible insolvency threshold in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencys than in the previous year?
The evaluations differ, but we are already working on the case of the case and we are already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency funds".
Terzenbach said the figures were still inconspicuous.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden Dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the riders of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced a request for PNN.

Even without Corona regulations, the parks are closed when darkness breaks in.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the State authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still out in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young interns are in tourism establishments, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The lock hour was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings there, said the head of the Tourism Association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Also, individual guests should be left prematurely.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with over 400,000 nights spent last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, Alois Lanz, head of the District Authority, defended the behaviour of the interns who had celebrated in several premises and could have been infested there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of young people for the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday onwards, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The eruption awakens memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the Corona spread across Europe during the initial phase of the pandemic.
More than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured the third slot on the last day of the Premier League through a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to enjoy the Europa League because the FC Chelsea still passed and qualified as a fourth for the Royal League.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71 minutes).
After a Red Card for Leicester City in the postgame period, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final score.
Chelsea, in the Champions League final opponent of the FC Bavaria, won the match against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Oliver Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who was also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
By Chelseas Sieg v. Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as the sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided to use the Watford and the AFC Bournemouth as a long time ago, but at West Ham United had to shudder around the classroom.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) glich Andrej Jarmolenko (85.) immediately out.
But the 1:1 (0:0) was sufficient because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which played three coaches in the season, goes down after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, a point was missing.
The Liverpool FC, which has been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured an association record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp with his team missed the score record in English football.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) played the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "that should motivate us to defend the title.
It's getting tough".
The first league bosses are expected to be satisfied in the end.
Due to the Corona virus crisis, football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature break or a broadcast of the remaining games was discussed on a neutral basis.
Finally, however, the season could be finished without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanjahu
Protests in Israel against Governor Netanyahus are becoming more and more intense.
In the night there were violent clashes.
On the night of Sunday in Jerusalem, the Israeli police went violently against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for taking part in unrest, and police spoke to Micky Rosenfeld.
The police, among other things, used water heaters to dissolve the rally.
In total, some 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening, according to media reports.
They protested unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's dealings with the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants had also been arrested for a field demonstration that supported Netanjahu, the news page reported "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested in police records near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a trade fair attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been easily wounded at the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have recently been several demonstrations against Netaniahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Last, Netanyahu was criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is being held up for immediate relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second Corona world.
The Corona crisis has seriously added to the country's economy.
The unemployment rate last stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel last rose to ever new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter power on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A collision took place on Saturday afternoon at the B58 at Ahlen 9 lightly injured.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Perhaps she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn off".
That must have seen the driver of a Mercedes transporter behind her probably too late.
He's in the back of the car.
In the accident three occupants were easily injured in the car and six in the transporter.
Several vans took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea locks border town down to Corona Suspect
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own actions against the Corona virus.
Now the country is reporting for the first time a case of suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a big city out of fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency has been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alarm.
If the case were confirmed, it would be the first official infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the secluded country.
North Korea had so far not registered a single infection, according to its own data, and described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of the disease were found in an "extreme" which illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had settled in South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation of the border crossing within the military buffer zone of four kilometres wide and largely still mutilated.
South Korea's military, but according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea was recognized as high.
This led to investigations of some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday, due to the suspicion, an emergency meeting of the workers' political office chaired by the leader Kim Jong Un called for its own information.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already ordered a precautionary measure on Friday, "Kaesong to completely block and isolate every district and region of others," it continued.
The data subject and all people in Kaesong who had contact with her had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "excession" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose a severe penalty.
According to estimates, Kaesong lives around 300,000 people.
Voltage before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still facing great summer break to discuss
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the board will also vote on the construction plan for the large urban development-east project," says the city press release at 4.30 p.m. at the Grand Hall of CongressCentrums Pforzheim at the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, July 28.
Especially the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
Most of them are scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed by the government and the municipal council not now to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticised project opponents Reinhard Klein as "outside parliamentary opposition", "indistinct", "speculation", "disgrace" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the local population list Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is less expensive than the City Administration's statements after subsidies, the existence of which Small is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently from forecasting in the town hall and by the supporters of the economy.
The city by its own power and not to create an investor: that was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Tale for administrative areas and a smaller inner city transformation in an ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a key role
Above all, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including often temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. The political leaders in the city are not innocent of the need to do this because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting bus traffic with thinly tuned speeds and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also decides on the participation of the city of Pforzheim/Entzkreis in the energy and climate protection agency.
It is also on the agenda of accession to the Baden-Württemberg climate protection pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban children's day care facilities and the application for admission to the Federal Smart City Fund.
Citizens are welcome, but must take care of Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his first season in the ADAC GT Masters with almost half a year of delay on July 31st.
Before the league of the Supersportcars can enter regular operation, the first test runs were completed.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the preseason Porsche," Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really did have a lot of fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand ourselves dazzling and we have also made tremendous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also run his first race.
From July 31st the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the Motodrome.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the route," Zimmermann says, starting for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitz ring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally to be fast".
As fast as Zimmermann really is, it turns out in two weeks.
"The teams play poker at the tests a little, of course," he says.
"At last we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pushed calendar.
Up until the beginning of November seven races will take place.
Currently there is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, Ex-Formel-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will reach the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister of Quarantine Decision coldly caught
According to the press reports, the British government's decision to put Spain's holidaymakers under quarantine for two weeks after their return was taken coldly by the Minister of Transport of the country.
Therefore, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Because of the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet deleted the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to return to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are only on holiday at the end of the day, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain has so far been regarded as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be hanged for holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapps."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the discharge of the severe curing barrier, the infection rates in the country increase again.
Virologists are mainly responsible for nightlife for the recent spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
Not necessary travel to mainland Spain is currently being advised by the British Government, the Canarys and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers, are excluded.
More than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that, on the day of the Navy in his country, warships were equipped with the most modern supersonic weapons.
With these weapons unique to the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian sea forces would be extended, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Marine Parade.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the agency Interfax also provided information on successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic rocket built for the Navy.
The hypersound weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropical is being built further
It is also built on the atomic bearing underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was called.
The planned sea threat is planned for the destruction of coastal targets.
The president, who himself was also on a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships were assigned to serve in the individual fleets of the largest country in the world.
Russia has a coastal area as large as no other country in the world.
For 300 years the Marine Russia has protected reliably, Putin said on the nationally celebrated day of sailors.
Also on many other Russian coastal Norways, the sea forces began the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength in a Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammo was also fired there.
There were not only warships, including submarines, but also fighter helicopters and jets in a video released by the Ministry of Defense.
Hurricane "Hanna" Reaches Texas: Helped by Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the NOAA Climate Authority announced the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called the emergency for many districts.
The Texas-grazing Corona pandemic made the work of the helpers more difficult, according to the U.S. media Abbott continued.
Evacued to Be Careful
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
Looking at the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is aggravated if you consider that it sweeps through an area that is the most affected area of Covid-19".
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called with caution people who had to leave their homes.
They should not miss practices, "to which we have accustomed", such as wearing masks, the governor said according to CBS.
It was important that all distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, emergency accommodation should be tested on Corona.
Damages had been reported only from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Reclaimed
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island immediately off the Texan coast, according to official information.
The tropical tower had previously been ranked one high for hurricanes of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had initially been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further inside the country and headed towards the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on the night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour to Hawaii.
However, the Hurricane Center expected it to weaken further.
According to the prediction, he should be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane wave.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year after a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes were expected to become up to six very strong vertebrates, the Authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year above the Atlantic Ocean, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, an average of only 10 percent, it was said at that time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is watching the storms closely and is in contact with the states concerned.
Four goals acquitted: Video Wizard "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were equally denied two goals
Naples - scored four goals, won four goals: Sassuolo Calcio experienced at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league series A a rabid evening - and was really angry at the video assistants of the speaker.
"A festival not given to Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so hard on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
The host Naples was guided by a gate of outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in which Philip Djuricic was first cheering the compensation.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took back the match due to a remote position.
Five minutes later Djuric shot the ball again into the net - again the VAR intervened.
Also the gates of Attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) the referee team withdrew after the VAR had been advised.
In the postgame period, Allan perfected the 2.0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar incident on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for Double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can convert his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and CEO of Mittelfeld Joshua Kimmich, has shown the third-best minutes of operation, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missed in decisive royal class duels.
In Münchner Schmuddelweather, the legal defender broke off a training game and was driven with a golf card from the square.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A stake in the 8th final return match against FC Chelsea on August 8 is unlikely to be possible, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12.
The Bavarias do not want to be stopped by the miscarriage of training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see of his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his victorious title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the end of the royal class on August 23.
"We just mastered the duties with championship and cup.
Now it's time to make the specials yet," said Flick.
Until the Munichers can deal specifically with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, however, the eight-final duty against the FC Chelsea stands for the first time.
After the 3:0 in front of the Corona break, Londoners in the domestic arena should not become a Bayern nightmare again, as in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and refuel confidence with a good game," said Flick.
A test of consent will take place on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had been on vacation for 13 days after the double, on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players for Edel-Sauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the square for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has inserted himself like all the new people well," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to just train, Flickr would prefer to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, training is now being carried out in the team strength for the Londoners, who are in match with the Flickr ensemble in the gamerhythm.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter finale against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the finale in Lisbon "is not quite that easy", the chief coach, who from Tuesday on can rely on the services of his new assistant, Miroslav Klose in training.
The World Championship Recordor Protector Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparation, which is particularly important for the 0-to-100 agreement.
With his current team, the work was "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winnings" is an impressive feature of his team.
At the tournament with Neuner-Teams, there was also an ambitious event on Sunday.
Of the service providers, all of them were present, including the migrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the king's class season is not guaranteed.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to crown its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to grant the World Cup title.
All the American races have been canceled.
Race Calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more race tracks have been added to the Grand Prix, which has been confirmed so far.
In October we will drive at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão in Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting for World Cup points on the Italian traditional racetrack in Imola.
This includes 13 races in the race calendar 2020 according to the current stand.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 Boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in this exceptional season will be held in the royal class of motorsports.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final racing calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, there could be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November before the official races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Rules require races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least three races on three continents to be awarded the World Championships.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are to be driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, FIA wants to assign the title to "extraordinary circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the beginning of the Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be available in America this year.
Absage encounters criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We are looking forward to being with them again in the next season," Carey explained.
The abstinence of the American races was particularly critical in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the infection rates in the São Paulo area were significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify abstinence.
It was prepared for the necessary security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest at Stephen Colbert's well-known latency show by videotape and gave an interview on what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US-latenight show by video switch.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the world’s powerful.
Also about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump, the teenager spoke.
New York City - Over the past two years climate activist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latency show about her plans in the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Schwedin.
In doing so, she spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children goes on the road" she has experienced.
State leaders and leading politicians who scoff at them in social media or even try to silence them find them "fun", as they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached on a well-known scene, in which she threw a bitter look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at that moment?
In response to the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert, she replied briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
With the quick answer, the experienced Satirician Colbert probably did not expect and disappeared from the picture briefly laughing.
With her "How are you?" speech about the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmaunder Real estate with trimmerpack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoes at the same time with Bayern Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB-Profi contributed three hits at 5:1 (1:1) -victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two turned elfmeters in the afterplay times of both halves.
With this the 30-year-old of the table-fourd two season games has now 34 season gates on his account before the end of the season - just as many achieved Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the expired Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with up to 30 goals, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly upwards.
Now the bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully asleep at the age of 73, told family members on Saturday in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had since founded the legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dream instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There is supposed to have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with large crucifixes.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970 for three years after it was founded.
There was a social decline.
The Bluesrock guitarist suffered drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographies reported.
For a long time Green was treated in the psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the picture area.
He is supposed to live on the street at a time when cemetery gardeners worked and spent some time in an Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish family of workers in the district of Bethnal Green in London.
In his early years, he was enthusiastic about American Blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of 11, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teen began to play professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Soon afterward he became involved in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, along with his bluesbreakers-colleges Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his shadow sides: Green did not succeed the media rummel, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and addiction he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
By the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly able to achieve an respectful result with an album inspired by religious themes.
Since then, Fleetwood Mac swims without him in a new formation on a success wave.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite a number of small solo successes, Green did not get a bigger comeback until he started in 1996 with a group of friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released some albums with Peter Green Splinter Group, free of drugs, until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend in his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
